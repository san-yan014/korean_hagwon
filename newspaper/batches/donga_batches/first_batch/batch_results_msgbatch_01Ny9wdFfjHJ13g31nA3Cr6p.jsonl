However, in public education, gifted education programs are not provided before elementary school 3rd grade. Until this time, it is considered more important to satisfy curiosity and provide intellectual stimulation.\\n\\nIn the past, gifted students were selected based on IQ or memorization ability, but nowadays the trend is to focus on the ability to recognize and solve problems from new perspectives, along with inquiry skills, critical thinking, concentration, and cooperation.\\n\\nGifted education candidates are selected through a process of recommendation → creative problem-solving ability test → performance assessment and interviews on experiments, etc. Appropriate identification methods and tools are used considering the student's characteristics, age, and educational domain (mathematics, science, arts and physical education, language).\\n\\nStudents hoping for gifted education can submit applications along with recommendation letters from school principals or supervising teachers when gifted education institutions announce their candidate selection. Gifted education institutions form selection review committees to conduct evaluations through interviews and experiments. Once gifted education institutions select candidates through this process, the final candidates are confirmed after undergoing final review by the provincial/metropolitan education office's Gifted Education Promotion Committee.\\n\\n○ Criticism of 'uniform testing' also raised\\n\\nBusan Science High School, a science gifted school, conducts first-stage selection through document screening and in the second stage selects approximately 1.5 times the admission quota by evaluating creative problem-solving abilities in mathematics and science fields.\\n\\nThen it conducts a 3-night 4-day science camp to closely examine applicants' giftedness. This is to evaluate comprehensive inquiry performance abilities through various scientific activities. The camp also evaluates report writing and presentations, with final selection made through in-depth interviews.\\n\\nAdmission eligibility is not limited to 3rd-year middle school students, so in the 2005 academic year entrance exam, 2 and 22 students who were 1st and 2nd-year middle school students respectively also passed.\\n\\nMost gifted education institutes and gifted classes under regional education offices also select students in the order of: 1st stage school principal recommendation, 2nd stage giftedness identification test (written exam), 3rd stage interview (or oral exam). For giftedness identification tests, most regions except Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education use test papers developed by the Korean Educational Development Institute [KEDI].\\n\\nHagwon education companies implementing gifted education are also selecting gifted students using self-developed methods or gifted identification methods introduced from foreign countries.\\n\\nHowever, experts raise questions about hagwon education companies' testing methods, noting that in the case of young children, it is a period when it is difficult for children to express their potential and abilities.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is criticism that in some cases, objectivity is lacking as giftedness is determined through uniform test papers.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3055, "output_tokens": 898, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The plan is to expand competitive systems within schools and improve overall academic achievement through 'difficult exams'.\\n\\nDue to the aftermath of overheated hagwon education, our education policy has been abnormally focused on how to reduce entrance exam competition. The current government has shown even more pronounced egalitarian tendencies.

Naturally, it becomes impossible to gauge students' objective abilities. Parents, unable to know their children's actual abilities and levels, naturally turn to hagwon education out of frustration. Although standardized tests disappeared from elementary schools in 1996, the hagwon education market did not shrink but actually expanded further.

Since report cards mostly contain 'nice words,' parents often have vague expectations that their children are simply doing well. If academic achievement levels were displayed as in the past, parents would accurately identify their children's weak areas and make efforts to supplement them. They say hagwon education is a problem if standardized tests are revived, but how many households currently don't use hagwon education?

It was probably an attempt to enlighten parents who are only interested in rankings. I think elementary school years are a time to have broader experiences and nurture dreams for the future, rather than ranking children by who studies well or poorly. Should children learn from the start that competing with others and being first is the best thing, before they even realize what they like or what they want to do? Making children obsessed with test scores from a young age is not right.

If families supplement their children's weak subjects at home and show just a little interest, there shouldn't be major problems. These days, children often say they dislike vacations. This is because they're too busy attending multiple hagwons. I feel sorry for young students who cannot play joyfully and have been reduced to exam preparers. If standardized tests are revived, I can clearly envision young students suffering through test preparation until late at night.

Even in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area, costs reportedly decreased by 31% from an average of 540,000 won [approximately $410 USD] to 370,000 won [approximately $280 USD] per month.\\n\\n▽Cooling of Special Purpose High School Overheating=The Ministry of Education announced that as part of measures to normalize special purpose high school operations under the hagwon education cost reduction measures, the admission competition ratio for foreign language high schools decreased from 3.80 to 1 last year to 2.57 to 1 for the 2005 academic year.\\n\\nA Ministry of Education official predicted that 'hagwon education overheating phenomena caused by indiscriminate special purpose high school admission fever will be resolved.'\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education also evaluated that it contributed to resolving educational gaps by income level and region by providing personal computers to 3,100 students from low-income families and marginalized areas.\\n\\n▽Self-serving Interpretation Draws Criticism=At a press conference on this day, the Ministry of Education announced that 'as a result of pursuing hagwon education cost reduction measures for one year, the number of hagwon students in the 2004 academic year decreased by approximately 12% compared to the previous year.'\\n\\nRegarding the basis for the '12% decrease,' a Ministry of Education official responded that it was 'calculated internally based on the 8.3% decrease in hagwon revenue announced by Statistics Korea on the 11th and the 4.6% increase in hagwon tuition fees.'\\n\\nHowever, there are criticisms that the decrease in hagwon revenue is largely due to prolonged economic recession, though the hagwon education cost reduction measures may have had some influence. In fact, even in the survey commissioned by the Ministry of Education, 27.5% of parents cited 'household income reduction due to economic recession' as the reason for reducing hagwon education costs.\\n\\nMoreover, the Statistics Korea announcement encompasses all types of hagwon education institutions, not just hagwons targeting elementary, middle, and high school students, but also technical and vocational training hagwons.\\n\\n▽Insufficient Effort in Result Analysis=The Ministry of Education had been actively pursuing hagwon education cost reduction measures under the leadership of then-Deputy Prime Minister for Education An Byeong-yeong one year ago in February last year.\\n\\nIt was also active in analyzing the effectiveness of measures, including surveying and announcing hagwon education cost reduction effects targeting parents of high school students nationwide in May and November.\\n\\nHowever, the Ministry of Education did not present new survey results to mark the first anniversary of the measures announcement. The performance announcement on this day was merely a rough compilation of past data. This amounts to turning away from efforts to overcome problems in future hagwon education cost reduction measures by distinguishing between what was done well and what was done poorly.\\n\\nRelated to this, some are raising concerns that the Ministry of Education's commitment to hagwon education cost reduction measures, which had been a priority project of the previous minister, may have cooled since Deputy Prime Minister An was dismissed.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3123, "output_tokens": 1145, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The evaluation institute is known to have internally decided to recognize multiple correct answers. Reporter Hong Jin-hwan jean@donga.com\\n\\nThe College Scholastic Ability Test [CSAT], which began in 1993, has continuously been embroiled in test writing error controversies. Each time, the issues were glossed over with stopgap measures, but following last year's world geography question error and this year's clear errors in CSAT, experts point out that comprehensive surgery is needed. In particular, the rushed test writing time and review process, and the barriers between writing and review teams are pointed out as fundamental causes that will repeatedly produce errors unless surgery is performed this time.\\n\\n○ Hasty Test Writing and Poor Review\\n\\nThe 'short-term retreat-style test writing' system is pointed to as the biggest cause of poor test writing. For this year's CSAT as well, 316 CSAT test writers including professors and teachers went into retreat at an undisclosed location for a month starting in October to begin test writing work. They started creating problems with about a month left until CSAT. During this period, test writers must create problems while staying within the curriculum and maintaining a 70% connection rate with EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] materials and questions. After completing this, they must also go through the process of examining commercial reference books, problem sets, and hagwon materials to check if there are any similar questions.\\n\\nCompared to the American SAT system, which creates many problems in advance using a test bank method, this is pointed out as being no different from hastily improvising problems before the test. The structure inevitably produces errors because test writers are assembled every year just before CSAT and problems are created in a short period.\\n\\nNot only test writing but also the post-test review process proceeds breathlessly. When test problems are disclosed to test-takers and the media and error suspicions are raised, the evaluation institute must gather these, go through expert review and academic consultation, and finalize the correct answers. An evaluation institute official said, \\\"Since score calculation, score report distribution, and each university's regular admission process are lined up afterward, we essentially have to finish review and confirmation within ten days.\\\"\\n\\nAs the evaluation institute is an organization, if it admits errors, it cannot avoid responsibility such as the institution head's resignation. This aspect is also one reason why errors are not admitted until the end. In the case of last year's CSAT world geography problem, admitting the error after a full year caused even greater confusion.\\n\\nFor this reason, experts point out the need to change the CSAT and college admission process periods. They suggest giving sufficient time between each stage of CSAT, score calculation, error review, and college admission processes. Lim Seong-ho, CEO of Haneul Education, said, \\\"Realistically, the schedule is so tightly packed that proper review and error correction are difficult,\\\" adding \\\"Since it's difficult to postpone university admission schedules, improvements such as moving CSAT up by one to two months from the current timing are necessary.\\\"\\n\\n[Enlarge]\\n\\n○ 'Professor-Dominated Test Writers Are the Problem' Criticism\\n\\nThe professor-centered composition of test writers is also pointed out as problematic. Of the 316 test writers responsible for this CSAT, over 75% are university professors, with the remainder being current high school teachers. When professors who form the core of test writers create questions, teachers serving as review committee members solve the problems, judge whether there are issues, and request question modifications.\\n\\nA high school teacher who participated as a CSAT review committee member said, \\\"Professors often don't know about high school students' intellectual level or learning degree.\\\" Regarding this year's Life Science II questions as well, schools and hagwon circles comment that \\\"they twisted it too severely.\\\" A hagwon instructor in Seoul said, \\\"Even hagwon instructors find it difficult to properly solve this year's Life Science II problems within the time limit (30 minutes).\\\" Last year's Life Science II subject was written so easily that perfect scorers appeared in droves. Therefore, there's criticism that professors participating in this year's test writing only felt pressure to write more difficult questions than last year and created problems without considering test-takers' abilities. Although CSAT practice tests are conducted every June and September to adjust CSAT difficulty, professors reportedly don't give these much consideration.\\n\\nIt's also problematic that test-writing professors don't readily accept criticism from reviewing teachers. While professors have no choice but to accept feedback in subjects like mathematics where solutions and answers are clear, in subjects like science or English where there's room for debate, reviewing teachers' opinions are often ignored. It's also known that when teachers make criticisms due to the status difference between professors and teachers, test-writing professors often become very displeased.\\n\\nExperts pointed out the need to change the personnel composition so that question writing and review are conducted equally. This is because proper verification is difficult to expect as long as the 'professor writing-teacher review' system continues. They suggest that both writing and review should consist of half professors and half teachers, or that review work should be handled by a second independent institution or external education-related organization rather than the evaluation institute.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3985, "output_tokens": 1331, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

System That Reduces Experts to Mere Props Must Change\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"[CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) Question Development Cannot Continue Like This] <Part 2> Short and Long-term Solutions to 'Reduce Accidents'\\n\\nAs errors in CSAT continue to recur, demands are growing to improve the question development and verification system, but changing the massive dinosaur that is CSAT is not a simple matter. Accordingly, experts point out that in the short term, verification should be strengthened to catch errors, while in the medium to long term, fundamental discussions about CSAT reform should begin.\\n\\nCSAT replaced the scholastic achievement test with the goal of evaluating comprehensive thinking ability, but after continuing for over 20 years, it has been criticized for degenerating into a test of problem-solving techniques. Particularly in high school settings, CSAT subjects and scoring systems change frequently, and the abnormally high EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) linkage rate has led to criticism that 'CSAT is ruining high school education.' As diagnoses emerge that CSAT has reached its limits, demands are gaining momentum to convert CSAT into a qualification exam for high school graduation or university admission.\\n\\n○ Enhanced Verification and EBS Reduction Are Urgent Priorities\\n\\nThe biggest reason last year's CSAT world geography question error was prolonged for over a year was that the process linking question development-verification-objection filing did not function properly. If it is inevitable to complete question development within tight deadlines under the current university admission schedule, verification and post-exam objection reviews must be conducted very strictly. However, the problem is that this process occurs among people connected through personal networks in academia. Particularly during objection review processes, the Ministry of Education and Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation [KICE] often make political judgments first, then reduce experts from specific academic societies to mere props. In the world geography case, just one day after KICE asked two academic societies for their opinions, these societies sent back replies saying 'no problems found' without even gathering member opinions.\\n\\nAccordingly, demands are high to establish a dual system that completely separates question development and verification. However, unlike Korean, English, and mathematics, the realistic limitation is that it is difficult to construct dual personnel pools in elective subject areas where expert groups are small. For this reason, some teachers and professors are even proposing alternatives to involve test-takers who achieved top-tier CSAT scores within the past 1-2 years in the verification process, reasoning that they can catch errors from a test-taker's perspective.\\n\\nThe previous government's decision to raise the EBS linkage rate to 70% in an attempt to reduce CSAT hagwon education also needs to be corrected. The side effect of textbooks disappearing from senior year classrooms while students memorize only EBS materials is worsening daily. Lee Seong-kwon, a teacher at Seoul Daejin High School and representative of the Korean Education Policy Teachers' Coalition, pointed out that \\\"the Ministry of Education's adoption of CSAT's EBS linkage policy was an anti-educational measure that further solidified one-way knowledge injection and problem-solving education.\\\"\\n\\nMoreover, EBS materials are inevitably error-prone because they are created in short periods compared to textbooks and have simpler verification procedures. In the reality where CSAT question development committee members bring EBS materials into retreat centers to develop questions, EBS errors directly lead to CSAT accidents as seen this time.\\n\\n○ Discussion of Qualification Exam Conversion Must Begin\\n\\nMore important than short-term prescriptions is fundamental improvement of the CSAT system.\\n\\nIn a reality where university admission competition is more intense than any other country, various problems inevitably arise when a state-administered relative evaluation exam has absolute influence on university admissions.\\n\\nThere are virtually no countries where national-level university entrance exams like CSAT dominate individual university admissions. In most cases, national-level exams are used as qualification exams for high school graduation or university admission. France's Baccalauréat and Germany's Abitur, which serve as both high school graduation and university entrance exams, are representative examples. These exams do not trigger blood-draining competition like CSAT because they divide pass/fail based on certain score thresholds.\\n\\nIn contrast, our CSAT adopts a 9-grade relative evaluation system, so instead of just needing to exceed a certain score, students must engage in infinite competition within the entire test-taking population. Because universities cannot conduct separate entrance exams due to the Three Prohibitions Policy (prohibition of university-specific exams, high school ranking systems, and contribution-based admissions), they set high CSAT weight ratios as an alternative, since CSAT has more credibility than school records [GPA]. This is why CSAT's influence is inevitably absolute.\\n\\nDue to these problems, the Ministry of Education already attempted to convert CSAT into a qualification exam 10 years ago. In February 2004, the then Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development announced 'Measures to Reduce Hagwon Education Through Public Education Normalization,' forecasting complete qualification exam conversion starting with the 2008 CSAT. However, this policy was abandoned due to the lack of viable alternatives to replace CSAT and concerns that it could revive university-specific entrance exams.\\n\\nOver the subsequent 10 years, CSAT question development errors became more frequent, and in situations where question bank methods cannot be adopted, creating new questions while avoiding previous exam questions has also reached its limits. To pursue CSAT qualification exam conversion again at this point, comprehensive reconstruction of the three major admission elements—school records, CSAT, and university-specific exams—must precede such efforts. To reduce CSAT's weight in admissions, how to evaluate school records and what range of university-specific exams to allow become important variables.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4020, "output_tokens": 1374, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The PR industry reports that \\\"word-of-mouth marketing is used across all industries, and many companies have the ability to create comments and blog reviews that don't appear obviously promotional.\\\"\\n\\n○ Part-timers and bloggers post paid content\\n\\\"While thinking about a place for a friends' gathering, I happened to find △△ Restaurant—both the taste and atmosphere were amazing.\\\"\\n\\nPR agency officials say that most posts like the above, which appear when searching portal sites with keywords like 'restaurants' or 'restaurant recommendations,' are advertisements. Mr. A, who operated a PR agency until recently, said \\\"95% of blog and cafe posts that appear at the top are advertisements\\\" and \\\"the top of search results is the number one target for PR agencies.\\\" These advertising posts, uploaded by part-time workers or paid bloggers, are popular in the restaurant and lodging industries where consumers rely heavily on search information.\\n\\nThe film and entertainment industries also use word-of-mouth marketing. An official from a film PR agency said they use it \\\"to create an atmosphere that builds 'anticipation' before a movie's release.\\\" This official said that 'rating terrorism' is already outdated, and recently they use methods like online activities linked with lead actors' fan cafes or online events such as preview screenings to generate word-of-mouth. There was also testimony that celebrities used PR agencies to expose themselves on portal sites' real-time search rankings. Mr. B, who claims to have worked on exposing a celebrity's search terms, revealed: \\\"Using programs, I charged 7-10 million won [approximately $5,300-7,500 USD] per hour to get names exposed in the top ranks of real-time search terms on portal sites like Naver, Daum, and Nate.\\\"\\n\\n○ Under advertiser pressure, even 'malicious comments' are posted\\n\\nWhile word-of-mouth marketing initially involved business owners doing it themselves or mobilizing acquaintances, recently PR agencies recruit through sales activities. Mr. Oh (30), who opened a cafe in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] in September, said nearly 10 companies approached him offering to generate word-of-mouth. The quote Mr. Oh received included specific prices such as: △10 bloggers writing actual visit reviews 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] △10 fabricated reviews without visits 300,000 won [approximately $225 USD] △top exposure on famous cafes 1 case 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD].\\n\\nThe PR agency industry says the core of word-of-mouth marketing is 'advertising without making it obvious.' Ms. Choi (29, female), who worked part-time posting comments for 6 months, explained: \\\"There are even manuals for writing comments and blog posts.\\\" When starting the part-time job, Ms. Choi was provided portal IDs managing 5 blogs, and her work involved cleverly hiding and placing promotional posts between posts on 5 blogs with different characteristics.\\n\\nAdvertisers subtly demand posting 'malicious comments' to attack competitors. Mr. A said: \\\"During meetings, they give signals by saying things like 'that competitor is bothersome' in passing, and then we mobilize part-time workers to post malicious comments.\\\" Stories emerged that companies even mobilize burner phones to post malicious comments.

It will be tentatively called the 'College Scholastic Ability Test Question Development and Operations System Improvement Committee.' Following criticism that the Ministry of Education and the evaluation institute have overlooked overall CSAT problems, they plan to appoint an external figure as TF chair and compose the committee centered on external experts. Not only education experts but also legal professionals and personnel from various fields will participate.\\n\\nThe TF will closely examine the problems of the current CSAT question development system. Following ongoing criticism of problems with the professor-centered question development and teacher-centered review system, they are considering changes to the roles of professors and teachers themselves. This follows persistent criticism that question-developing professors fail to understand frontline high school learning processes and high school students' levels, leading to difficulty adjustment failures.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education plans to form the TF in December, gather opinions from school fields, and announce a new CSAT system in March next year. The new CSAT system created by the TF will be applied starting with the 2016 academic year CSAT taken by current 11th graders. The new CSAT system will also be partially reflected in the June mock evaluation to be held before then.\\n\\n○ Fundamental Reform Needed... School Fields Are Angry\\n\\nCriticism has emerged that the current system where the government leads college admissions itself must be changed. The argument is that problems inevitably arise when the government evaluates 12 years of elementary-middle-high school academic ability with a single CSAT.\\n\\nCriticism is particularly fierce toward the Ministry of Education and evaluation institute that supervised question development. Lee Seong-kwon, representative of the Korean Education Policy Teachers' Coalition (a school teacher at Seoul Daejin High School), said \\\"This is virtually a death sentence for CSAT\\\" and pointed out that \\\"the fundamental problem was the state's monopoly on student assessment authority.\\\" Representative Lee said \\\"Student record-based admissions should be expanded and the authority to evaluate students should be returned to high school teachers.\\\"\\n\\nThe Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations also stated in a statement that day, \\\"CSAT has thus far developed questions difficult to solve with high school curriculum alone under the pretext of securing college admission differentiation\\\" and criticized that \\\"even that failed in difficulty adjustment, repeating easy CSAT and hard CSAT cycles.\\\" The teachers' federation argued that the CSAT system should be transformed into an absolute evaluation-style question bank national basic academic ability assessment.\\n\\nDespite the Ministry of Education's announcement, anger and distrust in education circles and school fields are not subsiding. The criticism is that the measures announced today should have emerged when the world geography question error controversy erupted in last year's CSAT. One high school teacher criticized, \\\"CSAT question error controversies have continued for years\\\" and \\\"they say they're fixing the barn after losing the horse, but they've lost far too many horses.\\\"\\n\\nYang Mi-jin (45), a parent with a 10th-grade child, said \\\"The reality of Korean society is that mothers chase after schools and hagwons from elementary school and chase after admissions briefings, determined to somehow send their children to good universities - this may look selfish, but it's the stark reality\\\" and asked \\\"Do you know that parents' efforts collapse in an instant due to the government's question errors?\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3422, "output_tokens": 1077, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The policy linking CSAT and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] was first implemented in 2004 during the Roh Moo-hyun administration to reduce hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] costs. At the time, the education community worried it could distort school classes. In 2010, the Lee Myung-bak administration announced a policy to draw 70% of questions from EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] materials.

These institutions are not public organizations under the Department of Education like ours, but private companies.\\n\\nThe US SAT absolutely does not disclose test questions and answers to the public. They operate using a question bank system like our driver's license written test, creating multiple sets of questions and rotating them for testing. The SAT can be administered this way because American students don't desperately cram for college entrance exams like we do. These days in Los Angeles and New York, there are some extreme Korean expatriate or 'goose' parents [parents who send their families abroad for education while staying in Korea to work] who send their children to Korean-style SAT hagwons, but originally American students don't prepare for tests by frantically solving past exam question books. Actually, there's no such thing as past exam question books. If there were, it would be illegal—it would mean the questions were leaked. This is why Korean hagwons that create question books and teach based on test-takers' memories of SAT questions after taking the exam get reported for fraudulent behavior.\\n\\nAmerica's College Board and ETS are, in short, companies that do business through the 'test questions' product. They collect various fees in exchange for creating questions, grading them, and reporting students' scores to each school. However, since universities collaborate with these organizations and only reflect results from here in admissions, American students have no choice. These institutions even oversee AP courses [Advanced Placement, college-level prerequisite subject completion tests taken in high school] that work more favorably than the SAT in college admissions decisions. Talk about these organizations operating the testing market as a monopoly/oligopoly and making money off students is nothing new. There's high critical public opinion about their practice of doing business with students by rotating improperly verified (and unverifiable) questions. In fact, shameless behavior of selling student information provided by students during testing to outside parties for money [$0.37 per person] has been discovered and they're currently in litigation.\\n\\nTheir compensation is also enormous. According to CNN reporting, in 2009, 19 College Board executives each received high salaries of over $300,000 [approximately $330 million won] annually, and the chairman at the time took home $1.3 million [approximately $1.44 billion won]. It's the nature of private companies to try to keep what happens in their own company as confidential as possible and to control their employees' speech to prevent external leaks. Therefore, it would be accurate to say that it's not that there are no question errors in America, but that even if there are, they're not being leaked.\\n\\nIf these institutions at least contributed to improving students' academic abilities, it might be understandable, but that's not the case either. According to a Wall Street Journal report a few days ago, among students who took the SAT produced by these institutions and entered college, the number of college students lacking basic academic skills in English, math, science, etc., and having to take high school-level remedial courses again increased from 1 million in 1999 to 2.7 million in 2011. Once you realize that the SAT is also 'watered down' like our 'easy CSAT' with no discriminative power, talk of adopting the American system cannot come easily.\\n\\nRather, I think we often fail because we don't understand American circumstances well and try to easily graft them onto our situation. Not only the SAT, but the 'EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media]-linked CSAT' that the Ministry of Education and Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation [KICE] put forward under the pretext of shrinking the hagwon education market and reducing learning burden can also be said to be an imitation of the American 'question bank' system. But what results is it producing now? In a situation where everyone is desperately trying to get into college, test-takers are in chaos preparing even for EBS. For subjects they're weak in, they have to receive separate hagwon education and solve EBS past questions as a bonus. There are even bizarre cases of taking English tests after memorizing passage content by looking at Korean commentary guides. Another harmful effect of EBS CSAT linking is that question writers cannot break away from hastily made EBS materials. It would be strange if question error controversies didn't arise.\\n\\nWhile we're at it, I'd like to address KICE as well. Even though KICE is a public institution, it has long departed from publicness in terms of operation. This is because of the 'Seoul National University College of Education mafia' that public opinion talks about these days.\\n\\nI also participated exactly once as a question writer for a test organized by KICE and experienced KICE's operations, and I thought it was truly pitiful. First, the participating professors were almost all seniors and juniors from specific schools, and occasionally a few graduates from other universities were thrown in for appearance's sake. I even heard rumors that some professors were desperate to make connections with KICE because they wanted to become question writers. This was because if selected as a question writer, you could legally (?) skip lectures and earn side income without paying taxes in addition to your salary. Once you establish a connection with KICE, you continue to be appointed almost every year, so in short, KICE was structured to act as the 'superior party' according to Korean sentiment. In such circumstances, can proper question writing and verification take place? Moreover, question writer professors spend up to a month a year on question writing, devoting energy and time to it—can we expect proper scholarly ability from such people?\\n\\nTo end the CSAT question error controversy, KICE and the question-writing system must be drastically reformed. First, people must be mixed so that talk of a 'Seoul National University College of Education mafia' cannot emerge. As for the question-writing method, I think it would be good to hire doctoral-level personnel as KICE staff to write questions together with frontline school teachers, then have minimal faculty input only for final review. How many non-regular doctoral instructors who haven't become full professors are there at each university now? I don't understand why they can't be utilized.\\n\\nWhenever the government announces its EBS-linked CSAT policy, I'm reminded of newspaper photos of students sitting in front of computers wearing headphones and listening to EBS lectures at school. I remember feeling very depressed at that time, thinking our students were like egg-laying chickens in a chicken factory rather than students. They talk about a creative economy, but can creative talent emerge from such an anti-educational situation?\\n\\nKim Gwang-gi, Professor of Social Studies Education at Kyungpook National University, Ph.D. in Sociology from Boston University\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4801, "output_tokens": 1777, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The briefing hall was packed, and those who couldn't get in lined up in long queues to receive placement charts and other materials. Reporter Kim Mi-ok\\n\\nThe difficulty levels of subjects in the inquiry domains of the 2007 College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT, Korea's national university entrance exam) varied greatly, and it's projected that standard score differences based on elective subjects will be very large even with the same raw scores. Consequently, test-takers' anxiety is growing, and elective subjects are expected to influence university admissions application strategies.\\n\\nMegastudy, a hagwon education company, estimated the standard scores for inquiry domains based on test-takers' preliminary CSAT scoring results and projected on the 19th that even with perfect raw scores, standard scores could differ by up to 14 points for social studies inquiry and up to 17 points for science inquiry depending on elective subjects. Last year, the differences were up to 14 points for social studies inquiry and up to 11 points for science inquiry, leading to evaluations that difficulty adjustment had failed.\\n\\nFor social studies inquiry, based on perfect raw scores, ethics had the highest standard score at 80 points, while law and society had the lowest at 66 points. By subject: sociology 74 points, Korean geography and economic geography 73 points, world geography 72 points, economics 70 points, politics 69 points, Korean history, modern history, and world history 67 points.\\n\\nFor science inquiry, Physics II had the highest score at 84 points, while Earth Science I had the lowest at 67 points. By subject: Chemistry II 79 points, Biology II 76 points, Physics I 74 points, Chemistry I 73 points, Earth Science II 71 points, Biology I 69 points.\\n\\nStandard scores tend to be lower when average raw scores are higher, meaning they become higher for more difficult subjects.\\n\\nAccordingly, test-takers must carefully examine whether each university uses standard scores as-is for inquiry domain scores, or applies converted standard scores to correct for score differences between subjects.\\n\\nTest-takers who selected ethics or Physics II would benefit from applying to universities that use standard scores as-is, since their standard scores will be high even if their raw scores are low. Conversely, test-takers who selected law and society or Earth Science I should apply to universities that use converted standard scores that correct for low standard scores.\\n\\nThe method for calculating converted standard scores differs by university. Seoul National University and many other universities create and use converted standard scores by utilizing percentiles according to their own criteria regardless of elective subjects. Some universities like Kyung Hee University create correction scores using the highest standard score and the test-taker's standard score.\\n\\nAccording to Seoul National University's converted standard score table last year, social studies inquiry percentile 100 was 69.54 points and percentile 99 was 68.36 points, while science inquiry percentile 100 was 68.75 points and percentile 99 was 67.50 points.\\n\\nAbout 80 universities including Sogang University, Sungkyunkwan University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, and Konkuk University plan to use standard scores as-is.\\n\\nReporter Kim Hee-gyun foryou@donga.com\\n\\n▼Test-takers and Parents 'Information Hunting'...

While this term frequently appears in the media, many people find it confusing and want to know exactly what it is. There are three or four similar terms: 'integrated curriculum essay-writing exam,' 'integrated curriculum essay,' 'integrated essay,' 'comprehensive essay,' etc. Do these terms refer to the same content, or do they have different meanings? We need to sort this out first.》\\n\\nFirst, we can consider 'integrated curriculum essay-writing exam' and 'integrated curriculum essay' to be the same term. This is what we need to identify. The term 'integrated essay' may ultimately refer to the same content as integrated curriculum essay-writing exams, but it comes from a different context. 'Integrated essay' emerged when universities that previously administered language essays and mathematics essays separately decided to 'combine' them for various reasons. Language essays alone were already interdisciplinary within the humanities and social studies areas, and mathematics essays alone were already interdisciplinary within the mathematics and science areas.\\n\\nThe implication of integrated essays is that the scope of interdisciplinary integration has now expanded to encompass both the humanities/social studies areas and the mathematics/science areas in essay questions. This means that humanities essays will include elements evaluating mathematical thinking, and science essays will include elements evaluating humanistic writing. The term 'comprehensive essay' is an umbrella term that vaguely encompasses all the aforementioned terms. After the transition from the Academic Achievement Test to CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), hagwons used expressions like 'integrated social studies' and 'integrated science' to reflect CSAT's interdisciplinary concept, and this expression was applied to essays. Ultimately, all these terms can be encompassed under the concept of integrated curriculum essay-writing exams.\\n\\nLet's clear up one misconception about integrated curriculum essay-writing exams. Many people think that integrated curriculum essay-writing exams are a new type of essay, but this term does not refer to a peculiar form of new essay-writing exam. This is because essays have always been interdisciplinary by nature.\\n\\nFirst, essays are not exams that focus on one subject and test knowledge of that subject—that is, they are not descriptive exams about a specific subject. In this respect, they are fundamentally different from the old university entrance exams. Ultimately, since students must integrate content learned from various subjects to solve given problems, essays are inherently interdisciplinary. From the early days when essay exams began, although slightly different meanings were assigned, the term 'interdisciplinary' has been used regarding essays. Therefore, when Seoul National University promoted integrated curriculum essay-writing exams last year, it should be understood not as an intention to introduce a new format, but as an intention to conduct exams faithful to the original nature and purpose of essays.\\n\\nSo what are integrated curriculum essay-writing exams? To answer this question, the term 'integrated curriculum' must be precisely defined. While these are not widely used terms, and it may seem like word play, intentionally distinguishing three concepts will help understand the integrated curriculum concept.\\n\\nLet's compare the three terms: 'mixed curriculum,' 'integrated curriculum,' and 'convergence curriculum.' What differences exist?\\n\\nFirst, mixed curriculum would refer to multiple subjects being combined in parallel. It would indicate a form where knowledge and content from various subjects are mobilized together. So, if we use the expressions 'physical combination' and 'chemical combination' metaphorically, it would be closer to the physical combination of subjects.\\n\\nWhat is convergence curriculum? It's when the identity of each subject disappears and they are bound together as one, resulting in a more comprehensive subject with a new identity. This can be compared to the chemical combination of subjects.\\n\\nSo what is integrated curriculum? Of course, it can be used at almost the same level as convergence curriculum, but the concept we currently use remains somewhere between mixed curriculum and convergence curriculum. Unlike convergence curriculum, the identity of each subject does not disappear. However, rather than simply combining in parallel like mixed curriculum, it breaks down the barriers between subjects and enables internal communication between different subjects.\\n\\nFrom the student's perspective, while learning initially occurs by subject, the learning content is not bound to individual subjects but transcends subject boundaries. In other words, it means studying integratively by applying what was learned in one subject to other subjects. Shall we look at an example? Students learn about 18th-century Korean society in Korean history class. However, rather than ending it with Korean history, when students learn about 18th-century Korean literary works in Korean language class and try to understand them by utilizing and applying what they learned in Korean history, integrated curriculum education occurs. Therefore, integration is something students must do themselves, not something teachers do, and education must cultivate such integrative ability.\\n\\nFrom this context, we can see that the integrated curriculum approach aims to cultivate the ability to study independently—that is, self-directed learning ability. However, such independent study cannot be immediately achieved just by having a lot of knowledge. Critical and creative thinking ability is needed to integrate acquired knowledge and information to rationally solve given problem situations, which is why integrated curriculum essay-writing exams evaluate thinking ability.\\n\\nWe have already mentioned two core aspects of integrated curriculum essay-writing exams. First, they seek to evaluate self-directed learning ability. Second, to achieve this, they seek to evaluate thinking ability for problem-solving rather than knowledge. Adding two more characteristics reveals the full picture of integrated curriculum essay-writing exams. Third, among thinking abilities, particular emphasis is placed on evaluating creativity. Fourth, to properly evaluate thinking ability, process-centered evaluation is emphasized over result-centered evaluation. We will examine each of these four logically connected characteristics one by one to uncover the identity of integrated curriculum essay-writing exams.\\n\\nPark Jeong-ha, Professor at Sungkyunkwan University's University College, Deputy Director of EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] Essay Research Institute\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4497, "output_tokens": 1412, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

KTU announced that 7,203 people attended the rally that day, but the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development counted 2,727. The majority were teachers who were absent without permission or left early without approval from their principals. Of these participants, 1,740 people, or 64%, were teachers who came to Seoul by KTX or bus. The organizers probably set the rally time for 2 PM to accommodate teachers coming up from the provinces or leaving early.\\n\\nOn the same day, a group of high school seniors board the KTX to Seoul for different reasons. These are students planning to prepare for essay-writing exams at essay-writing hagwons in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Mok-dong. Unable to expect essay preparation at school and lacking the rich hagwon education infrastructure found in Seoul, these provincial students head to Seoul to find hagwons with a drowning person's desperation to grasp at straws. They make excuses to their schools about doing experiential learning, but schools that clearly understand the situation say they have no way to stop them. Claims that hagwon essay education is ineffective are just well-fed talk to those who don't even have the opportunity to attend hagwons. Students turning their backs on school to study essay-writing—this could be international news material.\\n\\nWhether teachers and students actually encountered each other on this day is not important. The sight of them heading to Seoul for their respective reasons was enough to show the collapsed educational field. What was truly bewildering was the voices of education university students that erupted during the annual leave struggle. The National Council of Education University Students, which came out to support the rally, claimed that \\\"'Cho-Joong-Dong' [major conservative newspapers] and the Ministry of Education's attempt to force student-school teacher evaluation is a murderous conspiracy to drive 8 million elementary, middle, and high school students to suicide by subjecting them to endless, unproductive wasteful rank-order competition and creating class stratification from an early age.\\\" Even though they are university students, they are prospective teachers, and I'm astonished by the leap and simplicity of connecting teacher evaluation to murderous conspiracy. Then do the many parents who support the teacher evaluation system become accomplices to murder trying to kill their children?\\n\\nThe teacher evaluation system that KTU and education university students desperately oppose has only a plausible name while its content is utterly inadequate. The evaluation cycle is three years, and it's not even used as personnel data for appointments or performance pay. It's far, very far from the US or Japan, where evaluation results are linked to reappointment to immediately remove unqualified teachers. With teachers who fear evaluation like this, expecting essay education from schools in the first place seems like seeking fish by climbing a tree. While providing substantial essay education to make hagwons unnecessary is the teacher's duty, KTU opposed essay-type exams similar to the former university entrance exam and staged sit-ins first.\\n\\nOur essay exams arose due to unstable college entrance exam systems, but essay-writing is a global trend. In some ways, essay education is the perfect opportunity for schools to overwhelm hagwons. This is because it's not about writing techniques provided by cramming hundreds of students into lecture halls, but a field that only teachers who properly understand students can guide. Integrated subject-type essays especially require absolute preparation and cooperation from teachers of each subject. Looking at so-called prestigious essay-writing high schools, there are invariably teachers who make dedicated efforts for newspaper-based reading guidance, discussion learning, and revision guidance.\\n\\nTeachers who abandoned school for evaluation opposition protests, students wandering unfamiliar Seoul streets to get good evaluations.

However, excessive advanced learning is forbidden. It's important to assess your child's abilities and then ensure they have completely mastered the elementary curriculum, while for middle school content, exploring about one semester's worth is appropriate. Dong-A Ilbo file photo\\n\\n《Housewife Choi In-hyeon (41, Mok-dong, Yangcheon District [a middle-class area in Seoul]), who has a child entering middle school next year, has many worries. This is not only because the study load will be much greater than in elementary school, but also due to advice from senior parents that how the three years of middle school are spent will determine what level of university the child can attend. Already, people around her are moving quickly by sending children to hagwons for 'winter vacation intensive courses' or forming groups for 'essay-writing private tutoring,' making Choi feel anxious that 'maybe I'm the only one falling behind.'\\n\\nFor families with prospective 7th graders, how should they have their children study during this winter vacation to be effective?》\\n\\n○ Checking Current Academic Level\\n\\nFirst, you need to know what level your child's abilities are at in order to provide appropriate learning. To assess current abilities, you can use evaluation workbooks sold commercially or free academic diagnostic assessments and unit-based academic evaluations provided by online education sites for elementary and middle school students. Also, having children categorize subjects they find interesting versus uninteresting and listening to their reasons for each helps determine the direction of advanced learning.\\n\\nLee Byeong-cheol, team leader at '1318 Class,' advised, \\\"Starting from middle school, children must transition to 'self-directed learning' where they plan and study on their own,\\\" and \\\"Rather than parents deciding advanced learning plans arbitrarily, it's better to discuss with children to determine subjects, methods, and target scope together.\\\"\\n\\n○ Taking Care of Core Subjects First\\n\\nCurrently, middle school curriculum consists of 11 subjects in total: Korean, English, mathematics, social studies, science, ethics, Chinese characters, Korean history, music, art, and physical education.\\n\\nAmong these, Korean, English, mathematics, and science are subjects where once interest is lost, it's not easy to reignite learning motivation, so foundational learning is important.\\n\\nFor core subjects, it's essential to check the child's current level, and if they're relatively behind, reviewing elementary content is more effective than advanced learning.\\n\\nKim Hyeon-jun, hagwon instructor at Doosan EduClub, said, \\\"Especially for subjects like mathematics where foundations are important, forcing advanced learning can actually have reverse effects,\\\" and \\\"It's important to determine whether they properly understand the entire 6-year elementary curriculum.\\\"\\n\\nRather than setting quantitative goals for advanced learning like 'one textbook, two workbooks,' it's better to focus on developing consistent study habits with goals like 'three hours daily.'\\n\\n○ Setting Career Goals is Effective\\n\\nWhile studying hard in general is good, studying with specific goals set is more effective. To attend special purpose high schools, students must manage their school records [GPA] and do advanced learning according to school characteristics, whether foreign language high schools, science high schools, etc. For foreign language high schools, as the English score cutlines for successful applicants are rising every year, students must study consistently by dividing into areas like listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Also, since admission processes differ by school, it's effective to analyze each admission process, select the school most advantageous for oneself, and prepare accordingly.\\n\\nScience high schools have tracks for mathematics and science olympiad winners and students with excellent school records [GPA], and gifted education center graduates, so students must prepare in advance by leveraging their special talents and aptitudes. Since science high schools reflect school records [GPA] starting from 8th grade, students must rank in the top 10% by percentile.\\n\\nFollowing Busan Science Academy for the Gifted, Seoul Science Academy for the Gifted will open in 2008, so completing gifted education center curricula would be beneficial.\\n\\nFor international high schools, English essays have high point allocation, so study in English composition is necessary.

The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutor's Office conducted raids on JYou Phoenix headquarters and some affiliates in April this year on charges of multi-level marketing and quasi-banking activities, and has been investigating the 'shared marketing' method as a variant financial pyramid scheme.\\n'Shared marketing' is a method where participants receive 1.5 times the purchase price as allowance every time they buy 2.1 million won [approximately $1,600 USD] worth of goods. However, this only applies after purchasing more than 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD] worth of goods to become an 'agent member.'\\nThe difference from existing multi-level marketing is that members receive allowances simply by purchasing goods at online and offline stores. Traditional multi-level marketing requires members to sell products to lower-tier members to earn profits.\\nAccording to the JYou Business Victims Emergency Committee, this scheme caused damage to approximately 350,000 people, with total damages reaching 5.6 trillion won [approximately $4.2 billion USD].\\nThe investigation into JYou Group's political lobbying suspicions, which intensified around May when Grand National Party lawmaker Kwon Young-se disclosed a 'National Intelligence Service report' at the National Assembly, had been sluggish even after Chairman Joo was arrested in July.\\nHowever, it gained momentum on the 23rd when Chief Superintendent Jeong (43), head of Gangwon Donghae Police Station, was arrested on charges of receiving large sums of money from JYou Group affiliate executives.\\nThe investigation is expanding as it was confirmed that family members of Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Lee Jae-soon and a police superintendent-level official Park (50) conducted money transactions with JYou.\\nMeanwhile, Chairman Joo emerged as a famous English hagwon instructor in Seoul's hagwon district in the late 1970s and operated a publishing company and hagwon from 1982.\\nChairman Joo also stepped into politics, serving as chairman of the New Democratic Republican Party's Seoul Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] district committee in 1987 and supporting candidate Kim Jong-pil in the presidential election. However, he abandoned his political aspirations and entered the multi-level marketing business in the mid-1990s, building JYou Group into Korea's largest multi-level marketing company.\\nHe reportedly often boasted to those around him about his friendships with influential politicians, including Mr. P, who was a ruling party power broker during the Kim Dae-jung administration, and Mr. S, who served as an opposition party leader.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2611, "output_tokens": 726, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Daejeon = Reporter Ji Myung-hoon\\n\\n\\\"Find the hidden diamonds.\\\"\\n\\nThese were the words that Suh Nam-pyo, president of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), said to the admissions office as soon as he took office in July this year. It was an order to select students through special admissions who have special talents in one field or potential to grow as global leaders. KAIST chose a vocational high school student, not a science high school student or foreign language high school student, as the first case of discovering a hidden diamond.\\n\\nThe protagonist is Ji Seung-wook (18), a student in the computer game production department at Korea Animation High School, a specialized vocational high school in Hanam, Gyeonggi Province. This is the first time since 1995 that a vocational high school graduate has entered KAIST. The 1995 enrollee entered through regular admissions due to excellent grades.\\n\\nJi knocked on KAIST's door after seeing the admissions guidelines that target various Olympiad winners for special admissions. He won the grand prize at the 23rd Korea Informatics Olympiad in August this year with his '3D Music Box Studio.'\\n\\nKAIST's student selection committee, composed of 12 professors, began more in-depth screening. Olympiad awards are merely qualification requirements for special admissions; in actual screening, they serve only as reference materials.\\n\\nFirst, the quantitative evaluation indicated that acceptance would be difficult. His school records were about average. While his math and science grades were good, considering the characteristics of vocational high schools, which generally have lower academic levels, they couldn't give high weight to these grades.\\n\\nThe student selection committee began closely analyzing materials about Ji (excellence verification materials) including his personal statement, teacher recommendation letter, competition awards, school records, club activities, and volunteer work. The committee members were deeply impressed by the fact that Ji had already self-taught computer programming in 4th grade and created simple computer games in middle school that monopolized his friends' popularity.\\n\\nThey also took note of the fact that Ji had created 3D games at graduate-level or higher through self-study and had even created game engines (tools for game production).\\n\\nThrough heated debates among committee members, the non-quantitative evaluation concluded that his self-directed learning ability, creativity, and concentration were outstanding, making future potential expectations possible.\\n\\nJi was able to be accepted because non-quantitative evaluation has been applied in earnest starting from the 2007 academic year admissions. Its weight is as much as around 50%.\\n\\nWhile 20 students total benefited from this new admissions process, there is no case like Ji's where someone was selected based solely on potential.\\n\\nKAIST decided to introduce a 'personal tutoring system' starting next year, where graduate students will be paid teaching assistant stipends to provide individual guidance to help these students with creative learning while ensuring they don't fall behind in math, physics, and chemistry subjects. This is because even science high school graduates often fail to avoid failing grades.\\n\\nKwon Dong-soo, director of KAIST's admissions office, who calls this admissions process a 'future great talent discovery project,' said, \\\"Existing admissions have less controversy and risk of failure, but are not suitable for discovering creative talent,\\\" adding, \\\"We can't be certain this new admissions process will succeed, but if even one of them becomes a 'Bill Gates,' wouldn't that be a national blessing?\\\"\\n\\nKim Young-chul, Ji's homeroom teacher, said, \\\"If this type of admissions expands, the unfortunate reality where students who show creative talent in specific fields early on end up focusing only on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] when they advance to upper grades in high school will disappear.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3240, "output_tokens": 988, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

In short, essay-writing themes can be seen as problems about humanity and society. From identity questions like 'Who am I?' to practical questions like 'How should I live?', they seek to understand test-takers' concerns and thoughts. These themes are closely related to current issues that have become public discourse within relationships between individuals and individuals, or individuals and society. We introduce the 'Top 10 Issues Likely to Appear in This Year's Regular Admissions' selected by high school teachers who teach philosophy and essay-writing in public education settings and essay-writing specialist hagwon instructors.》\\nDo You Have a Logical Perspective on Current Issues?\\n[1] North Korea's Nuclear Test\\nIt's necessary to organize and review the North Korean nuclear issue in connection with the logic of power in international relations, the meaning of peace, and the limitations of dialogue and compromise-based problem-solving methods. Related to this, it's worth considering whether it's justified to resort to violent means to exercise self-defense rights, for example, whether another war for the war on terror is justified. Also, various discussions can be held regarding the North Korean nuclear crisis in relation to inter-Korean relations, Northeast Asian peace, and international order.\\n[2] Real Estate Policy\\nQuestions may arise asking whether it's truly justified and appropriate for the state to intervene and control the market economy. It's necessary to consider state intervention in housing prices in connection with abuse of state power and individual property rights issues. Let's examine how far restrictions on property rights according to public interest described in the Constitution are possible and how they should be exercised.\\n[3] Globalization and Economy\\nAlong with organizing the concept of globalization, one must organize the impact that globalization waves will have on our lives. It's necessary to examine major materials related to the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and understand the issues. The FTA issue is a field where opposing interpretations can exist according to the interests of each economic entity. Regarding the controversy over the bargain sale of Korea Exchange Bank, one should also organize opinions on the impact of foreign capital inflow on the domestic economy and claims that globalization intensifies polarization phenomena.\\n[4] Globalization and Cultural Conflicts\\nOne must consider the racial and religious conflicts that exist on the flip side of globalization. It's also necessary to study what the relativity of culture and the essence of religion are. What's the desirable way to respond when religion conflicts with community ethics or judicial systems, and what's the relationship between criticism of specific religions and freedom of thought are also possible exam topics.\\n[5] Original and Copy\\nCopies without originals, copies that replace originals, copies that are more original than the original are called 'simulacra.' What is the social meaning of 'knockoffs' that imitate originals? How do the meanings of originals and copies in the information society represented by the Internet differ from 'knockoffs'? Consider issues such as to what extent intellectual copyright should be recognized online.\\n[6] Women's Status and the 'Doenjang Girl' Controversy\\nThe doenjang girl [a derogatory term for materialistic women] controversy mocks the materialism and pretentious culture of some vain women, but some interpret that it reflects men's sense of crisis about women's improved economic status. It can also be considered in connection with female psychology that is unusually obsessed with external aspects. It's necessary to analyze gender discrimination or conflicts in our society from a sociological perspective and further consider human development and women's rights.\\n[7] Science Technology and Human Life - Ubiquitous\\nIn the science field, questions mainly ask about value judgments and solutions related to human life. Therefore, don't view the ubiquitous issue simply as an information technology sector issue, but consider the ripple effects it will have on all aspects of human life. It's particularly good to seriously consider the risks of science technology's human destruction and connect this with ethics (individualism), general society (various human relationships and social organizations, information protection and surveillance), and political economy (labor).\\n[8] Environment and Humanity\\nIt's difficult to argue against the proposition that we should protect the environment. However, common sense can be the most frightening prejudice. Environmental protection groups sometimes become power groups themselves. Environmental movements range from ecology that should be respected for its own sake, to pragmatism that views the environment as nature and should be protected for sustainable use. Let's examine representative environmental controversies like Cheonseongsan and Saemangeum through their various theories.\\n[9] Difference and Wrong\\nPast 'wrongs' are gradually moving into the realm of 'differences.' Homosexuality, which was once considered sinful, is now increasingly accepted as a sexual orientation that's 'different' from others. The logic is that even if someone has different beliefs from mine, they're not 'wrong' but just think 'differently' from me. What principles can embrace 'differences' and develop society in modern society?\\n[10] Crisis of Humanities\\nHumanities are facing a crisis as student quotas, employment, and professor research funds are relatively reduced during university reorganization processes. Does the crisis of humanities impoverish human dignity and authenticity of life? Or should academic disciplines with declining demand be eliminated according to market economy principles? Such topics may appear on exams.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4420, "output_tokens": 1520, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This was material distributed during a college entrance briefing held that day at Seoul Jeongsin Girls' High School by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education and the Seoul Education Research and Information Institute to resolve the curiosities of test-takers and parents waiting for the announcement of CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) scores.\\n\\nHowever, the 2007 academic year CSAT preliminary scoring analysis included in this material booklet had conflicting score forecasts from different experts, which only confused test-takers and parents instead of helping them.\\n\\nA vice principal from Seoul H High School wrote in 'Analysis and Strategy for Regular Admissions' that \\\"compared to last year, the average CSAT Korean language section score dropped by 5-6 points, while Math Type 'Ga' rose by 2 points and Math Type 'Na' rose by 7-8 points,\\\" forecasting that \\\"the Korean language section's highest score will rise from last year's 127 points to 135 points, while Math Type 'Ga' will drop from 146 points to 140 points, and Math Type 'Na' will drop from 152 points to 138 points.\\\"\\n\\nIn contrast, a school teacher from Seoul S High School included an estimated score table in 'CSAT Analysis and Application Strategy' showing that the Korean language section's highest score would rise by 6 points compared to last year, while Math Type 'Ga' would drop by 3 points and Math Type 'Na' by 10 points.

The Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, which administers the CSAT, had released estimates based on preliminary scoring of 40,000 test-takers' answer sheets immediately after the 2003 and 2004 CSATs, but stopped preliminary scoring due to discrepancies with actual results.

Particularly during this period after the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) has ended, most college entrance exam preparation students are said to be skipping school classes and busy preparing for essay-writing exams at hagwons. Due to this situation, an increasing number of schools are setting aside separate essay-writing periods for preparation.\\n\\nWhen did essay-writing exams become part of college admissions? Instead of university-specific entrance exams, students began to be selected based on CSAT and high school GPA scores, but as this reduced discriminatory power, essay-writing exams began to be administered separately, and the weight of essay-writing exams is gradually increasing.\\n\\nThe reason universities emphasize essay-writing exams is to evaluate problem-solving ability, thinking skills, and students' own thoughts that cannot be judged by CSAT and high school GPA scores. Essay-writing exams go beyond the realm of simple writing. They are conducted to evaluate what students think about problems spanning multiple areas and whether they can logically develop their own thoughts. This includes critical thinking skills, creative thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. It is difficult to cultivate critical thinking skills and creative thinking skills by teaching essay-writing separately from other subject education in an intensive manner.\\n\\nI remember that when I graded college entrance essay-writing exams a few years ago, it was difficult to find students who wrote with their own thoughts. This is true not only in essay-writing but also in interviews. When I asked about their motivation for applying to our university or their motivation for choosing their major, few students expressed their own unique thoughts. Most students gave almost similar answers according to problem types as a result of training through short-term education.\\n\\nAlthough it is fortunate that schools have belatedly stepped forward to provide essay-writing guidance on their own, the method of teaching it separately from other subject hours is not effective. Since thinking is about some object, techniques alone cannot be taught separately without content.\\n\\nThinking skills must be taught together with the content of subject education already covered in schools. If we reconstruct the curriculum to enable students to solve problems that occur in real life by relating them to subject content, rather than limiting ourselves only to knowledge within textbooks, we can not only motivate learning but also cultivate thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and self-directedness.\\n\\nIf essay-writing is regarded as another subject when the number and amount of subjects covered from elementary school through middle and high school are already extensive, it will not only confuse students and teachers but also make it difficult to expect educational effects.\\n\\nWhen each subject deals with real-life problems, integrated cross-curricular learning naturally occurs across multiple subjects. Creative idea generation is also possible through opinion presentations and discussions among students.

However, since direct counseling is not easy, online counseling services can also be utilized.\\n\\nWhen test-takers input their subject-area standard scores and school records [GPA] on counseling sites, college entrance exam hagwons extract applicable universities by reflecting various factors such as university-specific application areas, weightings, converted scores, and expected application rates.\\n\\nCollege Admissions Application Consulting Institutions\\n\\nAdmissions Institution | Content | Price | Website\\nEBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) | Provides placement charts by university and recruitment unit, analyzes total scores and subject-area scores among tied students | Free | www.ebs.co.kr\\nKim Young-il Educational Consulting | Customized diagnosis of universities and departments applicable for regular admissions through CSAT and school records | 77,000 won [approximately $58 USD] | www.01consulting.co.kr\\nMegastudy | Provides competition rates and expected passing lines considering actual number of test-takers | 16,000 won [approximately $12 USD] | www.megastudy.net\\nUway Central Education | Online admission prediction consulting | 38,000 won [approximately $29 USD] | www.uwayedu.com\\nJongro Hagwon | Calculates scores by applying subject-area reflection ratios and additional points for standard scores and percentile ranks | 30,000 won [approximately $23 USD] | www.jongro.co.kr\\nJungbo Hagwon | Internet service for applicable universities | Free | www.jb21.com\\nMyMaxstudy (Daesung Hagwon) | Placement reference chart service, provides Daesung Hagwon's application trend prediction commentary lectures | 25,000 won [approximately $19 USD] | mimacstudy.daum.net\\nEtoos | Provides CSAT score analysis, placement charts, and admissions data collection | Free | www.etoos.com\\nCase | Situation-specific consulting based on mock application results | 35,000 won [approximately $26 USD] | www.case.co.kr\\nJinhaksa | Expected passing scores and other university application information from applicants to the same university | 40,000 won [approximately $30 USD] | www.jinhak.com\\nCheckone | CSAT and school records analysis, university application strategy | 35,000 won [approximately $26 USD] | www.check-1.com\\nVitaedu | Automatic grade calculation and score comparison | Free | www.vitaedu.com\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2744, "output_tokens": 911, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Dong-A Ilbo file photo\\n■ Youth liberal arts book market stirring with 'Village of Intellectuals,' 'Reading the Classics,' and others\\n《The youth liberal arts book market is stirring. The publishing market is buzzing due to the 'integrated curriculum' essay-writing exams that Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University and others will implement starting with the 2008 academic year college admissions. Until now, the youth book market was centered on study guides. However, as awareness spreads that integrated essay-writing preparation cannot be done in a short period, youth liberal arts books are gaining attention.》\\n'Math Concert,' which explained mathematics from a humanistic perspective, sold over 20,000 copies within a month of publication. Since then, math liberal arts books targeting middle and high school students have followed one after another, including 'A Journey Through Mathematical History with Famous Paintings' and 'The Happiest Math of My Life.'\\nHan Seong-bong, CEO of Dongasia Publishing, which published 'Math Concert,' said, \\\"The foundation of integrated essay writing, which requires analyzing all texts to establish arguments, is mathematical essay writing,\\\" and predicted that \\\"not only math liberal arts books, but the publishing market that teaches multifaceted integrated thinking to teenagers will continue to grow.\\\"\\nPublishing companies directly creating educational curricula is also a new trend. The 15-volume 'Village of Intellectuals' series published by Gimm-Young Publishers last month will be used as integrated essay-writing materials at four major essay-writing hagwons [private academies] and two schools nationwide starting in January. Gimm-Young Publishers directly created a curriculum for utilizing this series, which involved 36 domestic young scholars, in essay-writing education. Editorial Director Shin Eun-young said, \\\"We prepared the educational curriculum from the planning stage.\\\"\\nGimm-Young Publishers also plans to create an instructor training program to teach integrated essay writing based on 'Village of Intellectuals' in partnership with Korea University's Continuing Education Center. Early next year, they will also establish an independent corporation 'School Gimm-Young' to professionally supply integrated thinking skills learning curricula to schools and hagwons.\\nHumanist Publishing, which has successively published the 'Living Textbook' series that sold over 700,000 copies, as well as the 'Reading Culture' and 'Reading the Classics' series, also plans to release a curriculum guiding essay-related reading around February next year.\\nLarge-scale complete works collections are also starting to gain attention again. Minumsa's 'World Literature Complete Works,' first released in the late 1990s, has seen increased sales as the emphasis on essay writing grows, with 136 series titles selling over 3 million copies to date.\\nThe fact that children of the '386 generation' [Koreans born in the 1960s who were politically active in the 1980s democracy movement], who created the children's book market that was previously barren, are now becoming middle and high school students also played a role in youth liberal arts books emerging as a new market.\\nYu Jae-gun, CEO of Greenbee Publishing, predicted that \\\"children who have been close to books since childhood have become middle and high school students, and combined with integrated essay writing that requires logical thinking, youth liberal arts book publishing will begin in earnest.\\\"\\nHowever, there are many hurdles to overcome for the youth liberal arts book market to become established. A representative issue is the distribution market problem. In the case of Kyobo Book Centre, a major bookstore, while there is a children's book section, there is no separate youth book section or it is limited mainly to study guides. Lee Jae-min, editor at Humanist, said, \\\"Because reading targeted at teenagers is still at the campaign level, it is not getting attention in the distribution market.\\\"\\nThe problem that youth liberal arts books are mostly similar summaries of classics or commentary books is also an issue. Jang Eun-su, CEO of Minumsa, pointed out, \\\"Due to a shortage of writers, it is difficult to create youth liberal arts books that synthesize various thoughts,\\\" and \\\"particularly, the problem is that scholars representative of each field are reluctant to write books tailored to teenagers' level of understanding.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3268, "output_tokens": 1054, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Questions would rightfully be raised about how student abilities could be assessed this way and whether it would have any discriminatory power. Yet this is the essay topic that 298 major American universities, including Harvard and Yale, commonly required from this year's applicants.\\n\\nThe essay topics required by most American universities can be easily understood by anyone. The topics are disclosed in advance through the internet. Students simply need to write essays at home based on their experiences and thoughts and submit them. American universities select students based on school grades, SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) scores, and 2-3 essays. Of course, this is possible because universities have 100% authority in student selection and have accumulated evaluation capabilities.\\n\\nCompared to American university essays, Korea's essay exams are extraordinarily difficult. As essay exams for regular admissions at 20 major domestic universities begin from the 3rd, test-takers and their families are trembling with anxiety. As it becomes known that 'handwriting' is also part of the evaluation in essay grading, students are reportedly flocking to handwriting hagwons. Parents only feel at ease when they send even kindergarteners to essay hagwons. Not only students but also teachers and grading professors experience stress. When essay exams expand to science tracks and integrated essays are implemented in earnest starting from the 2008 academic year admissions, stress will spread even further.\\n\\nEven if students and parents experience stress, it would be bearable if essays greatly helped normalize education. However, recent survey results of university professors suggest otherwise. Half held the opinion that essays are not suitable methods for normal high school education or selecting excellent students. 44% of professors said essay grading lacks fairness and consistency.\\n\\nNevertheless, Deputy Prime Minister for Education Kim Shin-il says, \\\"If essays help normalize education, we should proceed,\\\" and \\\"Parents will also be anxious, but I will work hard to comfort and guide them well.\\\" This sounds leisurely. The overflow of essay hagwon education, including essay hagwons, is another piece of evidence that essays are not helping normalize school education. It is true that the current essay exam system has many problems. Even Lee O-ryeong, who has been writing for 50 years, said, \\\"I'm not confident I could pass Seoul National University's essay exam.\\\"\\n\\nEssays are becoming a 'monster'-like existence that torments students who don't know how to study and teachers who don't know how to teach. Essays are the result of the Ministry of Education succumbing to the so-called three educational 'no' policies—prohibition of comprehensive exams [university-administered entrance exams], high school ranking systems, and donation-based admissions—and pressure from the KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) to neutralize CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) and conduct admissions centered on school records. The aspect of being a self-rescue measure by universities that cannot conduct proper comprehensive exams cannot be denied either.\\n\\nIn that case, abandoning both essay exams and the three 'no' policies entirely and fully recognizing universities' autonomous student selection authority might produce new solutions for resolving essay stress.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3144, "output_tokens": 879, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

All 20 questions were selected from middle school and high school textbooks.\\n\\nThis proves numerically the science and technology community's concern that \\\"Korea's math and science education level has become so deplorable that industrial workplaces complain about the declining academic ability of new employees.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that six science and technology organizations including the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies announced their \\\"Position of the Science and Technology Community on Elementary, Middle, and High School Science Curriculum Reform\\\" on the 10th and urged measures to normalize math and science education reflects this reality.\\n\\nThey argue that \\\"the current curriculum's excessive emphasis on students' subject choice rights has put Korea's scientific workforce foundation at risk of complete collapse.\\\"\\n\\nSeoul National University College of Natural Sciences Dean Oh Se-jeong (54) and Korea University College of Engineering Dean Kim Su-won (55), who participated in the joint announcement, met on the 12th at the Dong-A Ilbo [major Korean daily newspaper] conference room in Seoul to discuss this issue.\\n\\n―Dean Oh, you first raised issues about middle and high school math and science education in 2003. How is the recent situation?\\n\\n▽Dean Oh Se-jeong = The talk about first-year university students not being able to keep up with math and science classes came up long ago. It's getting worse year by year. Particularly, the math and science learning level of students who went through the 7th National Curriculum implemented from 2000 is, in a word, pathetic. I heard that in Sungkyunkwan University's math proficiency assessment of over 750 freshmen from 15 universities last year, the incorrect answer rate for elementary 6th grade level problems approached 50%.\\n\\n▽Dean Kim Su-won = I heard that in a first-year engineering class, when a professor drew an integral symbol on the blackboard, a student asked \\\"What is that symbol?\\\" It's absurd, but I couldn't even laugh.\\n\\n\\\"After Math and Science Became Electives, Learning Ability Rapidly Declined\\nUniversity Freshmen Get 50% Wrong on Elementary 6th Grade Math\\\"\\n\\n―Where do you think the fundamental cause lies?\\n\\n▽Kim = It's not the students' fault. The education authorities bear the greatest responsibility, though their intentions were good but their methods were immature. I agree with the intent to reduce the academic burden on high school students preparing for university entrance exams. But when you ignore difficulty levels and make all subjects equally elective, isn't the result obvious?\\n\\n▽Oh = The problem is leaving even content that's difficult but absolutely necessary to learn up to choice. Math, physics, and chemistry are subjects where the effects of diligent study appear gradually after several months. It's not easy for students who have staked everything on college entrance to show that kind of persistence. It's natural to choose subjects where you can immediately improve your grades by rote memorization.\\n\\n―The results of not studying sufficiently in high school must appear directly in university.\\n\\n▽Oh = The habit of only seeking easy paths for practical benefits continues into university. Students flock only to lectures that are easy for getting grades for employment. Classes that are challenging to study are unpopular even in university.\\n\\n▽Kim = Do you know that important basic content is gradually being removed from high school math and science textbooks? They're removing difficult content to appease students' avoidance behavior. They're creating math and science where you can score points through memorization without understanding.\\n\\n▽Oh = As the level of math and science taught in high school becomes lower, university lecture quality inevitably declines. In lectures with the same name, we have to teach increasingly easier content. It's natural that graduate levels decline.\\n\\n▽Kim = Today's students seem too obsessed with \\\"methods to avoid mistakes.\\\" In easy tests, small mistakes greatly affect results. They've become accustomed to this kind of competition throughout high school. The habit of fearing mistakes is the biggest obstacle to creative thinking.\\n\\n\\\"To Reduce Avoidance, Even Removing Important Content\\nEngineering Students Even Ask What an Integral Symbol Is\\\"\\n\\n―What immediate measures can be taken right now?\\n\\n▽Oh = When I went to the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development and said \\\"science education must be strengthened,\\\" they showed a reaction as if to say \\\"why is a university professor interfering in high school teachers' power struggles?\\\" Even when I visited executive-level officials to persuade them, there was little effect. I'm thinking of requesting help so that strong problem-raising comes from the industrial field, including business leaders.\\n\\n▽Kim = Korea University provides free math and science education for two weeks before admission for freshmen. But participation is too low. This contrasts with the flood of inquiries for English conversation courses during the same period.

It's good to set a goal of reviewing that day's learning on the same day and create specific weekly and monthly study plans.\\n\\nIt's also good to make an effort to correct about three bad habits from your three years of high school. Particularly, habits of being addicted to games or being lazy must be abandoned immediately from the moment you decide to retake. If you start your repeat test-taking life while maintaining bad habits, failure is as obvious as fire.\\n\\nWhile focusing on supplementing weak subjects, you must never give up on Korean, English, and Math midway. If all three subjects have good scores, not only do application opportunities increase, but you can also gain more benefits such as bonus points.\\n\\nKim Yong-geun, evaluation director at Jongro Hagwon, said, \\\"You must compare the scores and grades you received this year with grade-specific cutoff points and make detailed plans about how much time to invest in which subjects,\\\" adding \\\"You must steadily build your skills by examining how much your scores improve in each subject through monthly mock exams.\\\"\\n\\n○ Choose your own retaking strategy\\n\\nAfter considering your level and final goals, it's also important to find suitable study methods such as self-study, subject-specific hagwons, comprehensive retaking classes, or boarding hagwons.\\n\\nFor students who are thorough in self-management even alone or have good overall grades but struggle with one or two subjects, it's good to supplement lacking subjects by taking online lectures or attending subject-specific hagwons. It's advisable to create specific study plans yourself and focus on advanced learning for subjects you're good at and intensive supplementary learning from the basics for lacking subjects.\\n\\nStudents who lack confidence in time management and have much higher learning efficiency when there are people around to help should attend comprehensive retaking hagwons. Comprehensive retaking hagwons conduct regular classes from 8 AM to 5 PM and have self-study or supplementary classes until 10 PM, which is not much different from senior year of high school.\\n\\nSome hagwons can conduct efficient classes and establish systematic learning strategies by gathering students of similar levels through selection tests, which helps test-takers with significant psychological anxiety.\\n\\nBoarding hagwons are suitable for students who lack learning motivation and want to escape various temptations to focus only on studying. This is because they help students concentrate only on studying through strict learning and life management in isolated learning spaces, and they take responsibility for guiding even supplementary classes or self-study after regular classes.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that since dormitory supervisors manage all aspects of life and outings are permitted only about once a month, this may have reverse effects on test-takers who cannot endure dependent and strict lifestyles.\\n\\nLee Man-gi, evaluation director at Uway Central Education, said, \\\"For successful retaking, regular living habits and learning motivation are most necessary,\\\" adding \\\"In the early stages of retaking, rather than focusing unconditionally on problem-solving, it's better to understand principles by subject and establish the big framework.\\\"\\n\\nBy reporter Choi Chang-bong ceric@donga.com\\n\\n10 Commandments for Successful Retaking\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3630, "output_tokens": 1195, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Cyber universities are there for you\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"《'You can earn a university degree online.'\\nCyber universities offering distance education that allows students to receive university education online from home or work without attending school are in the midst of recruiting new students.\\nCyber universities, which launched as 9 institutions in 2001 under the Lifelong Education Act, now number 17. Cyber universities (distance universities) provide learning opportunities for people who want to study but lack the time or financial means. Students can study anytime, anywhere just by connecting to the internet without having to attend school regularly, and tuition is cheaper than regular universities, making it perfect for satisfying academic aspirations.》\\n\\n○ Advantages of Cyber Universities\\n\\nThe biggest advantage of cyber universities is that they are not constrained by time and place. Also, since they select students based on academic plans and personal statements, there's no need to prepare for entrance exams like CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam).\\n\\nAffordable tuition compared to offline universities is another advantage of cyber universities. Cyber universities implement a credit-based tuition system.\\n\\nWhile it varies by school, tuition costs 50,000-80,000 won [approximately $38-60 USD] per credit, with average semester tuition of 1-1.2 million won [approximately $750-900 USD]. Students can typically take 9-21 credits per semester, so tuition varies depending on course registration.\\n\\nKyung Hee Cyber University and Hanyang Cyber University allow credit exchanges with offline universities under the same foundation, enabling students to attend offline lectures directly at those universities and enjoy campus romance.\\n\\n○ Same Benefits as Regular Universities\\n\\nGraduating from a cyber university grants a regular bachelor's degree just like regular universities, providing qualifications for studying abroad or graduate school admission.\\n\\nStudents can receive long-term, low-interest student loans provided by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development through the Korea Housing Finance Corporation under the same conditions as regular universities. They receive the same support for military service deferment, tuition income tax deductions, double majors, and early graduation.\\n\\nScholarship benefits are similar to or more generous than regular universities. In addition to merit-based scholarships for top students, there are various types including family scholarships that reduce tuition when two or more family members attend, scholarships for disabled students or basic livelihood recipients, and various special talent scholarships.\\n\\n○ Diverse Majors\\n\\nCyber university departments include humanities and social sciences fields like business, law, real estate, education, and social welfare, as well as information technology (IT) fields like computer engineering, digital imaging, and multimedia, similar to offline universities.\\n\\nSince about 70% of enrolled students are working professionals seeking re-education, most schools are well-equipped with practical business or computer-related departments. Korea Digital University operates a joint tax accounting curriculum in industry-academia cooperation with Samil Accounting Corporation.\\n\\nSpecialized departments that directly help with employment or entrepreneurship are also highly popular. Each school features many practical departments that would be difficult to establish at regular universities.\\n\\nPractical Foreign Languages (Korea Digital University), Entertainment Management (Seoul Digital University), Beauty Design (International Digital University), Face Management and Yoga Meditation (Wonkwang Digital University), Venture Agricultural Management and NGO (Kyung Hee Cyber University), Fire and Disaster Prevention (Korea Cyber University), Hotel Tourism Management and Restaurant Entrepreneurship Management (Sejong Cyber University), and Jewelry Appraisal Dealer (Open Cyber University) attract many applicants each year with intense competition.\\n\\nWhile some people enter these majors to help their existing careers, many also knock on the door seeking new careers, making them worth actively challenging.\\n\\n○ School Selection Tips\\n\\nSince everything is conducted online, school location is not important.\\n\\nHowever, the university's financial status, department curriculum, and thoroughness of academic management are important. If your desired department is offered at multiple universities, it's good to carefully compare faculty and curricula through their websites. How actively Q&A between professors and students occurs can also be a measure of educational quality.\\n\\nCyber university websites provide mock lectures so you can experience how actual classes are conducted. Previewing lecture quality and content through these helps with school selection. Also check how conveniently the course system is structured.\\n\\nYou should also examine whether double major or minor systems exist. If a school has many departments helpful to you, actively utilizing the double major system can achieve greater results.\\n\\nIf you're familiar with cutting-edge devices like PDAs or portable multimedia players (PMPs), it's good to check how much these devices can be utilized for coursework.\\n\\nChoi Jong-du, Chairman of Admissions Management at Korea Digital University, said, \\\"Educational quality is recognized to the extent that many students who graduate from cyber universities go on to graduate school,\\\" adding, \\\"Active club activities provide good opportunities to expand interpersonal relationships.\\\"\\n\\nArticle by Kim Hee-kyun, Reporter foryou@donga.com\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3906, "output_tokens": 1207, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is because today's mothers are too 'smart.' These mothers, who have already completed their own thorough analyses of their children, often rebuke hagwon teachers saying 'you don't know well enough.' Director Park says, \\\"No matter what novel solutions I present, today's mothers have already analyzed things on their own foundation and draw their own conclusions. Mothers read many books and see and hear so much from their surroundings that you can't compete with them unless you know quite a bit.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a time when the best a mother could do was lovingly pack food for her child and quietly pray that they would study hard. But mothers in their 40s are different. They are so well-versed in educational information and passionate about education that they could be called amateur experts.\\n\\nMr. Lim (38), who teaches math group tutoring in Bundang, Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, says, \\\"These mothers themselves experienced the brutal college entrance exam wars during their school days and are already well-educated, so they have an underlying belief that they are not inferior to experts in terms of knowledge and information. There is a widespread and firm belief that children don't grow on their own but are made.\\\"\\n\\nMothers who pride themselves as education experts are divided into two types: information-type managers who hunt for information by visiting hagwons, and conviction-type managers who try to improve their children's grades with know-how gained through their own efforts.\\n\\nHousewife Choi Seon-woo (40, Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul) reads books to her daughter, who will become a high school student this year, for 30 minutes every morning during vacation. Ms. Choi was shocked when her daughter scored in the lower ranks on her first ethics test after entering middle school.\\n\\nAfter carefully observing her daughter, she concluded that the problem was insufficient 'reading comprehension ability' - her daughter couldn't concentrate while reading. Ms. Choi heard from others that if 'reading' doesn't work, training through 'listening' is good, so she began listening training during every vacation. During vacations, she mainly reads general books aloud, and during exam periods, she records textbooks on tape and has her daughter listen 5-6 times repeatedly.\\n\\nMs. Choi says, \\\"Just as children's abilities are all different, mothers' abilities are also all different. If we do our best to support them within our capabilities, won't there be good results?\\\" Indeed, whether due to such maternal effort or not, Ms. Choi's daughter now keeps up with others in social studies and ethics subjects.\\n\\nNowadays, there are many mothers who proudly think of giving up their own work for their children's education. After much consideration, they give up work because when they work outside and leave their children only to hagwon education, money is spent while children's education doesn't work out properly.\\n\\n▶See interview article below\\n\\nMs. Jang (47) quit her job (pharmacist) when her eldest child entered high school and youngest entered middle school. She made this bold decision saying that in today's climate where 'information' is life, a child's competitiveness includes not only the child's talent and effort but also 'mother's ability.'\\n\\nShe says, \\\"Between arranging hagwon schedules and attending various education-related information lectures and college entrance exam briefings, I'm busier than when I was working. Sometimes I think 'I have no life of my own now,' but I have no regrets when I think of my children's future.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Kim (43), who operated a private clinic in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, also temporarily stopped hospital work last year and went abroad to study with his two sons. Dr. Kim says, \\\"When I think of the benefits I enjoy from graduating from a good school, I felt I must send my children to good schools too. I simply chose to invest in education rather than leave property to my children.\\\"\\n\\nFor today's mothers, children's education is not about giving up on themselves. They feel a sense of accomplishment and find their own work in it.\\n\\nA housewife who recently became a full-time housewife after working says, \\\"When you take care of assignments and homework, you realize that children cannot handle it alone. There are many hagwons and much education-related consulting, but the only place that can find the right answer for my child is ultimately the mother.\\\"\\n\\nPark Wan-jeong, Contributing Reporter tyra21@naver.com\\nHur Moon-myeong, Reporter angelhuh@donga.com\\n\\n■ Kim So-hee, author of 'Gangnam Mothers Who Design Their Children's Future'\\n\\n\\\"There are people who criticize mothers passionate about their children's education, saying they're just making their kids miserable, but that's talk from people who don't know the reality.\\\"\\n\\nKim So-hee (41, photo), a Seoul Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] housewife in her 20th year of Gangnam life, boldly quit her job and declared herself a full-time housewife when her eldest child entered elementary school, stepping forward as the child's education supporter. Regarding this, Ms. Kim says it was \\\"because of the public education system that seemed impossible for children to handle alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Our country's public education has limited information about educational goals and curricula. The educational information that mothers get is mostly hagwon information focused on college entrance exams. Understanding of the entire educational process that children learn in public education settings is lacking. The only people who can fill these gaps are parents.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Kim, who says \\\"taking interest in textbooks, which are the foundation of public education, is the best education,\\\" states, \\\"To provide education that truly suits children - education that neither schools nor hagwons can provide - parents must properly understand the educational process, set educational schedules, and draw appropriate blueprints. This is the reality of our education.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Especially 386 generation [Koreans born in the 1960s who were politically active in the 1980s democracy movement] mothers often think of themselves as victims of rote learning, so they have great passion for letting their children have diverse experiences. They want to send them for language training and provide various experiential learning even if it's financially burdensome.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Kim says, \\\"Children's education doesn't work just by being overzealous - forming partnerships is important. Today's mothers in their 40s are smart, so compared to mothers of the past, they have many more conversations about studying and make great efforts to match their children's preferences.\\\"\\n\\nShe said that while the saying that you need money to provide good education is somewhat true, money is not 'everything.'\\n\\n\\\"Educational expenses are endless if you keep spending. Our generation has to prepare for retirement ourselves, so it's dangerous to spend too much on education. That's why today's mothers research ways to spend educational expenses efficiently. Even when sending children to hagwons, they plan what to pursue as a long-term strategy, and if they enter a long-term plan, they worry and worry again about how to reduce costs. Mothers of our generation also make good use of cost-free internet education community information.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Kim says, \\\"There are many smart 386 mothers around me who think that teaching children is their career,\\\" adding, \\\"They are confident 'education supporters' who not only care for their own children but also share experiences and know-how with mothers who have the same concerns.\\\"\\n\\nRecently, she published a book called 'Gangnam Mothers Who Design Their Children's Future,' compiling stories of mothers who study with their children and prepare for their children's futures.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4962, "output_tokens": 1857, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It is motivation. People without the motivation to become middle class. Those who have fallen from the middle class, or those who have dropped down—they are the underclass.》\\n\\nA Society Without Hope Breeds an Underclass\\n\\n'Hikikomori.' This is a term referring to people who shut themselves in their homes and refuse to go out, unable to adapt to society, and it's a word commonly heard from those concerned about Japan's younger generation. There is another new word that similarly worries those concerned about Japanese society. It is 'underclass society,' encountered in a book by Miura Atsushi (三浦展), who is active in marketing and sociology. Coming across this term at the tail end of Japan's 20-year prolonged recession makes one's heart sink, because it's not just a story from across the sea. The reality of polarization in Korean society—the collapse of the middle class after the foreign exchange crisis, the problem of irregular workers, the mass production of unemployed youth—pierces the heart.\\n\\nThe problem with Japanese society is the trend toward underclass status among the young generation in their early thirties. The author reveals that the 'underclass' already comprises 40% in Japan, and that freeters—simply put, part-time workers—aged 20-34 number over 4 million. But there's an important fact here. The underclass that Miura speaks of doesn't just mean the lower classes, but encompasses the meaning of an absence of hope and motivation rather than material poverty.\\n\\nA society where hope for improving living standards through annual income increases despite not having much wealth, or motivation to rise to the middle class, has disappeared can only produce more underclass people. So is there no solution? What's certain is that equal opportunity must be implemented even more thoroughly.\\n\\nThe author first proposes various measures as social countermeasures to provide preferential treatment to those with lower incomes. He suggests giving entrance exam bonus points to the underclass, making University of Tokyo tuition free, putting university classes online, providing financial support when students from rural areas advance to Tokyo for studies, and having the upper class fulfill noblesse oblige. Through this, Japan should prevent the misfortune of heading toward a 'nation of division' and realize a 'great cultural nation.'\\n\\nThe author also argues that at the individual level, communication and conversation skills must be developed. Young people who insist only on being themselves, avoid communication with others, and refuse social adaptation are likely to belong to lower classes. Therefore, the shortcut to preventing underclass formation is to open the channels of dialogue that are blocked throughout society.\\n\\nIn Korea, the top 20% of income distribution accounted for 39.7% of total income in 2002. Last year, that proportion decreased to 38.9%. The share of the bottom 20% also decreased from 7.7% to 7.2%. Instead, the share of the middle 60% increased from 52.7% to 53.9%. Looking at these statistics, while the situation of the bottom 20% became relatively worse compared to the other 80% over the past three years, overall income inequality shows a trend toward improvement. Korea's current problem is not so much 'polarization' as it is the issue of a 'new poverty class' where the poverty of the poor is deepening.\\n\\nIf we want to create a good world for our society before such problems appear, rather than thinking of Japan's underclass society as just a distant country's story, I recommend reading this book.\\n\\nSeo Jin-young, Professor at Seoul National University of Science and Technology Graduate School\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3138, "output_tokens": 849, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The child was tired from managing both school life and tutoring, and the actual effects weren't significant. Kim emphasizes the importance of 'conviction,' saying, \\\"If you emphasize studying too much when they're young, they might actually become distant from studying. Information should be used as reference, but parents must make the judgments and decisions.\\\"\\n\\nLee Kyung-min (35, Hyehwa-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul) also shares, \\\"Due to the burden of dual-career work, we had high dependence on hagwon education [사교육] from first grade, but in first grade, rather than studying, it's better to slowly explore overall life to see if the child is properly adapting to school life.\\\"\\n\\nParental role instructor Park Yong-ok (49, female) also says, \\\"Excessive interest in children can interfere with a child's autonomy,\\\" adding, \\\"In front of parents with vast information and their attempts to inject it, children can become strangers.\\\"\\n\\n○ Enrollment is an excellent opportunity to change children's habits\\n\\nTeacher Lim Young-ah (36, female, Apgujeong Elementary School in Seoul) emphasizes that elementary school enrollment is an excellent opportunity for children to change two types of habits.\\n\\nFirst is helping them learn compromise and consideration by following the rules of group life in daily life, making them realize they are 'individuals within a community,' and second is the opportunity to change study habits by focusing on school education. Unlike hagwons that have many questions and require quick answers, schools emphasize process, so some children may find school studies bland or lacking content. However, the faster they adapt to school education, the more leisurely they can study as they advance to higher grades.\\n\\n○ From senior first-grade parents to new student parents\\n\\nChoi Yu-young (39, Hyeonjeo-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul) advised, \\\"After enrolling my child in school, I was entirely focused on school, wondering if they were doing well, but I learned that such parental attitudes can be stressful for children. If parents always prepare school supplies for them, they might later think it's natural and not think about doing it themselves, so be careful.\\\"\\n\\nLee Suk-hee (37) says, \\\"I only scolded because my child absolutely refused to read books, but I later found out it was because their eyesight was poor. If possible, it's good to get an eye exam at a nearby ophthalmologist before enrollment.\\\"\\n\\nExperts cited establishing basic habits as the most important task in first grade, such as 'sharing, taking care of my belongings, going to the bathroom on time, and using public property carefully.' They advise not to worry excessively as children have much more adaptability than adults think. If parents pay attention to their children's basic habits and fundamental manners at home, their children will be able to spend first grade smoothly.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3749, "output_tokens": 1287, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Some students ask us to send them through friends.\\\"\\n\\nAt Seoul O High School, about 600 students graduate each year, but every year 20% of students don't attend graduation ceremonies. Since graduates rarely come back later to pick up their diplomas, teachers worry every year about how to handle the diplomas.\\n\\nTeachers say that the changing customs around graduation season make them acutely aware of the current state of school education. It's hard to find graduation ceremonies these days that turn into seas of tears when the lyrics \\\"To my sister who received a shining diploma...\\\" come to an end. Diplomas are no longer shining objects.\\n\\nOne teacher clicked his tongue, saying, \\\"In the old days, people would roll up diplomas and carefully store them in tubes, worried they might get wrinkled, but now we have to call and plead with them to come pick them up.\\\"\\n\\nThere are two main surface reasons why students don't take diplomas seriously. One is college entrance exam failure. When students can't get into university or don't get accepted to their desired university, their wounded pride keeps them away from graduation ceremonies. This phenomenon is more severe in coeducational schools. Students who decide to retake the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] enter boarding hagwons early and struggle with books when graduation ceremonies are being held.\\n\\nThe other reason is overseas study programs or travel. Since college freshmen these days start preparing for employment from their first year, they want to do things they couldn't do before after college entrance exams are over. Some prospective high school students, having suffered from college entrance exam pressure, choose to go to hagwons when hagwon schedules for advanced learning overlap with graduation ceremonies.\\n\\nHowever, teachers point out that students' individualistic tendencies and lack of sense of belonging to school are more fundamental reasons. Having spent more time at hagwons than at school, their sense of school as a 'community' has already faded. Also, students don't need to feel sad about parting with friends since they can contact them by mobile phone anytime even after graduation ceremonies end.\\n\\nThe parent generation, who used to hug friends and burst into tears just hearing graduation songs, would find it hard to understand today's students. When times change, social customs change too. But it's bitter that college entrance exam pressure, advanced learning, and collapsed community consciousness are accelerating such changes.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2687, "output_tokens": 628, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Moms Are Struggling Too\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Jung Ji-eun (28, female), a graduate student planning to marry this year, feels intimidated when she hears about seniors and acquaintances' parenting experiences. She says, \\\"From various prenatal care practices to infant gymnastics and educational programs, and even hearing that 'mothers need to be good at English to consult with native English teachers,' I'm already feeling parenting stress for a child who hasn't even been born yet.\\\"\\n\\nMothers' efforts to invest in their children begin from pregnancy and prenatal care. Cross-stitching, quilting, and knitting become popular because they're said to be good for brain development and prenatal education. Various creativity and motor skill enhancement programs that are rumored to be best started before 6 months of age also cost considerable educational fees. Money aside, the mental and physical burden is overwhelming.\\n\\nMothers' parenting wars become even more intense once the child is born. Endless worries continue about how their child's development compares to other children, what to feed them, and what kind of educational stimulation to provide.\\n\\nKwon Su-ah (29, Hyeonjeo-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul) participates in music play classes with her child who just turned two. Although she questions whether her child is really learning anything given the chaotic classroom atmosphere, when she listens to various parenting information shared among mothers after class, she feels she cannot fall behind in the competition. This is just the beginning.\\n\\nOnce children progress from elementary school to middle school, studying becomes directly connected to college entrance exams. Believing that studying determines their children's lives, mothers become their children's 'customized managers.' They take full responsibility for study strategies, choosing hagwons, time management, health management, and even managing their children's friendships, pouring all their energy into pioneering their children's futures.\\n\\nHousewife Lee Sang-hee (pseudonym, 39, Buam-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul) sent her only daughter to a specialized high school last year. While those around her praise this achievement, she cannot relax until her daughter enters university because the children of her sisters-in-law, who have been constant comparison targets with her daughter, attend prestigious foreign universities and elite universities in Seoul.\\n\\nThinking it would be difficult to hire private tutors because her house is old and lacks proper transportation, she rented an officetel at a midpoint between school and home to create a study room. She believes she should do this much for her child if it produces better results.\\n\\nNowadays, mothers keep track of even minor rumors about teachers and pay attention to which hagwons their children's competitors attend. Building strong relationships among mothers is essential. Being ostracized from the information trading where you give what you should give and receive what you should receive can be fatal for the child. Mothers cannot help but feel stressed.\\n\\nHousewife Y (38), who lives in Yeouido, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, reveals, \\\"In a world where a child's ability is considered equivalent to the mother's ability, mothers whose children have good grades wield tremendous influence,\\\" adding, \\\"There are often times when I have to swallow my pride to obtain educational information.\\\"\\n\\nIf the center of gravity for mothers in the past was 'housekeeping,' nowadays there's an atmosphere that emphasizes 'successful parenting.' In this situation, the sense of alienation is great for mothers whose children have 'dropped out' of the competition.\\n\\nHwang Seon-hee (pseudonym, 49, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul) says, \\\"No matter how much I support from behind, there's no suitable hagwon for my high school sophomore child whose grades are in the middle to lower ranks,\\\" adding, \\\"Why can't my child study well? I wonder if there's something wrong with me, and it's painful and upsetting.\\\"\\n\\nSome mothers fear they might spend their later years meaninglessly, having focused only on their children while having no life of their own. Ms. Namo (42, Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province) sent her two middle school children to study abroad in the United States early last September. Though their circumstances are somewhat difficult, she believed it was the best decision parents could make for their children's future. She says, \\\"I'm anxious that I might suffer in my later years because I haven't prepared for retirement, but there's nothing I can do about it.\\\"\\n\\nExperts say, \\\"Parents and children should create synergistic effects to become power moms and power kids, not super moms and super kids,\\\" emphasizing, \\\"Mothers must keep in mind that they are assistants to their children, not managers.\\\" They add that finding their own activities through religious activities or various hobbies gives children opportunities to become independent.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3620, "output_tokens": 1162, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Compared to past college students who thought having more absences (缺) than attendances (出) on the attendance sheet was youthful vigor, today's college students with so many assignments to complete are in a pitiful situation.\\n\\nBut ironically, several professors I've met recently said, \\\"Today's college students don't study properly.\\\" This was a common comment regardless of whether it was a four-year university or community college, Seoul-area university or regional university. College students are supposedly buried in books at the library from dawn because of job preparation... When I asked, puzzled, various examples emerged.\\n\\nProfessor A from the English Literature department said, \\\"Students' classroom attitudes have noticeably worsened over the past few years. In the past, when students were sleepy, you could see them trying somehow to fight off drowsiness, but nowadays once attendance is checked, there are many kids who just lie down and sleep.\\\" He reported that the very students who slept during English class would grab TOEIC materials and run to the library as soon as class ended. Professor A diagnosed that the 'classroom collapse' phenomenon that worsened in the 2000s—where middle and high school students studied at hagwons [private academies] at night and slept at school during the day—seems to be continuing into universities.\\n\\nProfessor B from the Public Administration department, who had only taught undergraduate courses but started teaching graduate courses this semester, asked new students about their motivation for entering graduate school during the first class last month. Since many often choose graduate school as an escape from job market difficulties, he wanted to somehow motivate the students. Most students gave ordinary answers like wanting to learn more about public administration. Professor B, who was gradually becoming dismayed that these adults in their mid-twenties had no concrete future plans, was definitively crushed by the last answer. A student from a so-called SKY university [Seoul National, Korea, Yonsei—Korea's most prestigious universities] answered, \\\"Because my parents told me to go.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor C from the Liberal Arts department reported that more and more students fiddle with smartphones or tablet PCs in large lectures. At first he thought they were taking notes on the lecture content, but that wasn't the case. Students listening to TOEIC online lectures or creating works for contests were increasing. Professor C said, \\\"Some students nowadays prepare for jobs during humanities lectures, and when they hear that humanities has become important in interviews, they go looking for humanities special lectures,\\\" adding, \\\"Their judgment according to TPO (time, place, occasion) seems to be declining.\\\"\\n\\nSynthesizing these various examples, it seems a trend is emerging among college students where the quantity of studying has increased but the quality of academic work has declined. Professors identified college students' dependency and anxiety as the causes. Children who moved according to hagwon schedules following their parents' coaching from a young age have diminished ability to think about what they should do on their own even as college students. Their judgment about where to focus each moment and what they should be doing at any given time also becomes blurred. Since everyone says you need to build specs to get a job, they are driven by anxiety to move busily.\\n\\nThe polarization of self-direction among grown students is as concerning as the polarization of hagwon education [private supplementary education] among young students. The world is becoming more complex and fierce by the day, yet it seems like adults in name only—who lack the decision-making ability to break through this—are increasing.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3340, "output_tokens": 976, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The instructor at hagwon B is better because they're a KAIST [Korea's top science and technology university] graduate.\\\"\\n\\nEven to a casual listener, this was information that only experts would typically know.\\n\\nAs the conversation intensified, the cafe door opened and another mother entered. All the mothers' gazes turned to her in unison. I understood why from their subsequent conversation. Her daughter was ranked first in her entire school.\\n\\nWhen I counsel parents, I find that the world of mothers is largely divided into three categories. The first consists of mothers whose children are ranked first in their school or have entered Seoul National University. The second includes mothers who aren't 'mothers of first-place students' but are well-versed in college admissions information and share it with others around them. The rest are the ordinary majority of mothers.\\n\\nThe group that deserves attention is precisely the third category of mothers. They are always thirsty for college admissions information and often regard the information they hear from other mothers as essential 'gospel' for their children. They pour out college admissions information heard at cafes, social gatherings, and mothers' meetings onto their children without filtering it. Their children, who don't understand why, must bear all that pressure.\\n\\nFrom an expert's perspective, this kind of information doesn't serve as 'medicine' in the long term. Korea has countless high schools and universities. College admissions change every year, and admissions strategies and study methods vary enormously. Sometimes even experts get confused.\\n\\nWhat's important for parents is knowing their own child well. But many mothers place more importance on 'hearsay.' It's similar to giving a child with a cold digestive medicine, blood pressure medication, and even tongjinsotang [a traditional Korean herbal tonic].\\n\\nStudying requires 'study power' as a foundation for good results to continue long-term. Study power is a kind of 'basic muscle' formed through students' individual abilities and their surrounding environment.

The priority is increasing conversation time with your child and understanding what areas interest them and what methods they prefer.

Wheel-shaped primroses were at their purple peak, and thorny elaeagnus burst with yellow buds between sharp spines.

While downtown Jeju was racing toward summer, the high elevations of Hallasan visited on the 17th were just beginning to experience spring.\\n\\nAlthough spring had come to Hallasan's summit, scars were visible everywhere. After passing the Triangle Peak rest area (1,620m above sea level) on the Gwaneumsa course, fencing bent like taffy came into view. The fence installed to protect climbers from landslides and rockfalls had collapsed under the weight of winter snow. This nearly led to a major disaster. On the 19th, a large boulder struck the climbing trail. Hallasan National Park immediately prohibited access to the 2.5km section from Triangle Peak rest area to the summit.\\n\\nCracks and landslides are even changing Hallasan's appearance. Baengnokdam's north wall continues to collapse whenever heavy rains and typhoons strike. Predictions suggest that the circular crater shape will soon change to a horseshoe shape with one side broken open. Damage caused by climbers is also significant. Below the summit deck, plastic bottles and disposable lunch containers secretly dumped by climbers were abundant. Although access around Baengnokdam crater is restricted, climbers who ignore these restrictions are frequently spotted.\\n\\nOn the descent via the Seongpanak course, disturbing scenes were witnessed at the Azalea Field shelter as well. Lunch trash secretly dumped by climbers was visible in various spots, and some climbers secretly smoked cigarettes while avoiding park staff enforcement. Following 85 people last year, 21 people have been caught smoking through the end of last month this year. The Seongpanak course, which attracts about 36% of climbers among Hallasan's five climbing routes, experiences parking wars every weekend.\\n\\nA Korean-American visitor (38, hagwon instructor) experiencing Hallasan for the first time said, \\\"Although the course was somewhat monotonous, the crater, native plants, and strange rock formations were special. It was certainly worthy of being designated a World Natural Heritage site,\\\" but added, \\\"However, I was somewhat disappointed to see climbers drinking alcohol at the summit and carelessly dumping trash.\\\" Hallasan attracts visitors from around the world including China, the United States, Russia, France, Italy, and Pakistan.

Kang Si-cheol, director of Hallasan National Park Management Office, said, \\\"Hallasan is Korea's treasure. We should cherish and protect it, but climbing etiquette is below standard.

This is the percentage of women who hold driver's licenses (as of 2014). In other words, half of all women are qualified to drive. Compared to 4.9 out of 100 in 1990, this represents roughly a 10-fold increase. While the number of female drivers has grown, their traffic accident fatality rate is not as high as one might think. In 2011, the number of deaths per 100 traffic accidents involving female drivers (fatality rate) was 1.5, lower than the overall rate of 2.4. Seol Jae-hoon, a senior research fellow at the Korea Transport Institute, said, \\\"Female drivers generally drive more safely, which is why their fatal accident rate is lower than that of men.\\\" However, the reality on the roads is different. Many women still face serious threats while driving. Moreover, unlike men, women who are less skilled at driving are still labeled with the derogatory term 'Mrs. Kim [a pejorative term for female drivers stereotyped as incompetent].'\\n\\n○ Female Drivers Being Disrespected\\n\\nThe joint reporting team from Dong-A Ilbo and Channel A for the 'Start Your Engine, Good Driving' project asked 182 female drivers aged 20-60 nationwide various questions related to 'driving as a woman' over a week starting from the 20th. 60.4% of respondents (110 people) answered that they had felt disrespected by other drivers simply for being female drivers. During the survey process, complaints poured in such as \\\"Even when an accident was caused by the male driver's fault, he lectured me saying 'don't drive like that'\\\" and \\\"I overtook a car that was going too slowly, but when he realized I was a woman, he made sure to overtake my car.\\\"\\n\\nRespondents pointed to the prejudice that 'women can't drive' as the most difficult 'wall' to overcome. They said that even when driving at the regulated speed, there are still many cases of being honked at or threatened to speed up. Ms. Lee (67, female), who has been driving for nearly 30 years, said, \\\"I've seen male drivers speeding or violating traffic signals while shouting 'you have to go with the flow' many times.\\\" Many female drivers also thought that other drivers disrespected them when cutting in without signaling or maintaining safe distances. Ms. Kim Eun-hee (42, female) said, \\\"A male driver saw me and suddenly tried to cut in. When I didn't yield, he followed me to the next traffic light, rolled down his window, and cursed at me.\\\"\\n\\nPrejudice that assumes women are more at fault than men in contact accidents also persisted. Ms. Yoon (51, female), who works as a driving school instructor, said, \\\"Two years ago, my car was rear-ended while waiting at a traffic light, but the other driver said 'since you're a woman, you could have made a mistake' and blamed me. Not only the other party but even the insurance company employees only acknowledged it was the rear car's fault after seeing the dashcam footage.\\\" A female driver in her 20s complained, \\\"A taxi forcefully cut in front of me and our side mirrors slightly collided, but he scolded me like I was a child and drove off.\\\"\\n\\n○ \\\"Yield One More Time\\\" - Advice for Female Drivers\\n\\nWe asked veteran female drivers for advice for women facing difficulties on the road. Yoon Young-mi, vice president of the Korea Federation for Environmental Movement's Mothers' Safety Leadership Association, said, \\\"You shouldn't be intimidated so that you can properly claim your rights when you face unfair situations from male drivers,\\\" adding \\\"However, rather than just trying to fight, an attitude of yielding is also necessary.\\\" Han Su-jin, section chief at the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, advised, \\\"Paying attention to defensive driving is the secret to 30 years without accidents.\\\"\\n\\nChanging the prejudices of surrounding male drivers and urging them to practice considerate driving is also one method. Kang Soon-ip, manager of the Incheon Women Drivers Association, said, \\\"I always tell my son not to look down on female drivers,\\\" adding \\\"Please make sure to tell your family members who are closest to you that women and men are equal on the road.\\\"\\n\\nJoint Planning:\\nMinistry of Public Safety and Security, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, National Police Agency, Korea Transportation Safety Authority, General Insurance Association of Korea, Korea Transport Institute, TBS Traffic Broadcasting\\n\\nChoi Hye-ryeong herstory@donga.com · Reporter Kwon Oh-hyeok\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3380, "output_tokens": 1145, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

While I'm concerned about the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] that's about a month away, what worries me more is what happens after CSAT. Some people say that while there's a lot schools should teach for students' holistic development, as long as college entrance is the realistic goal of high school education, we just need to help manage their school records well and ensure they perform well on CSAT—what's there to worry about after that? But when I think about the essence of education, the reason schools exist, and the future of our children, my heart becomes heavy with concern.\\n\\nAs someone responsible for managing a frontline high school, I feel ashamed to say this, as if I'm spitting in my own face. The educational disruption that occurs every year after CSAT—that is, the phenomenon where classrooms fall into a kind of 'educational vacuum' within an implicit cartel between teachers and students who think that since the test is over, teachers have nothing more to teach and students have nothing more to learn—clearly reveals the current state of our education system, which is buried solely in college entrance exams and lacks even basic reflection on what schools should truly teach and what kind of humans they should cultivate.\\n\\nOnce CSAT ends, empty seats in classrooms increase as students rush to hagwon districts in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and other metropolitan areas to participate in rolling admissions interviews conducted by individual universities or to prepare for essay-writing exams or practical skill tests for regular admissions. In the chaotic atmosphere of a marketplace with students coming and going, even if classes are held, they can only be formal, and studying cannot possibly enter students' minds. In such situations, keeping students within school boundaries is as difficult as holding onto an unbridled colt, and in some ways, even reckless.\\n\\nOf course, most schools try to fill the gap with special education programs such as creative experiential activities, career education, essay guidance, practical skill guidance, reading guidance, special lectures by external instructors, and small-scale sports competitions, each establishing their own measures. However, there are no suitable educational programs or materials to keep 12th graders intoxicated with the liberation from entrance exam hell in the classroom. Students kill time watching videos, chatting, and sleeping, and even their patience quickly reaches its limit. The feelings of teachers who helplessly watch this can only be as empty and hopeless as scarecrows standing blankly in harvested fields.\\n\\nIn the stark reality where the second semester of 12th grade, which is not reflected in college entrance school record calculations, has become virtually meaningless, allowing this structural vicious cycle to continue—where the month and a half from when CSAT ends until winter vacation begins becomes a time of actual educational incapacity and educational abandonment—while calling for normalization of school education is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.\\n\\nEducational authorities must prepare fundamental improvement measures for the current CSAT system that reveals these various problems. It would be worth reviewing delaying the CSAT timing to mid-December by about a month and appropriately adjusting the excessively skewed rolling admissions-oriented recruitment ratio. Please devise practical solutions to return high school education to normal.\\n\\nJeon Sang-hun, Principal of Gwangju Cheomdan High School\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3073, "output_tokens": 814, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

'Chinese History Was Challenging'\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Job aptitude test held at 5 domestic and 2 overseas locations\\nOn the 18th, test-takers are leaving Apgujeong High School on Apgujeong-ro, Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul, after taking the 'GSAT,' Samsung Group's written entrance exam. Reporter Jang Seung-yoon tomato99@donga.com\\n\\n'Compared to previous years, Chinese history-related questions increased in the job knowledge section, making it challenging.'\\n\\nThis was the general reaction from test-takers who completed Samsung Group's Job Aptitude Test (GSAT, formerly SSAT) on the 18th for the open recruitment of university graduate (Grade 3) new employees. This exam was the first to be held since Samsung announced an overhaul of its hiring system last year—the first change in 20 years.\\n\\n○ Subject areas and difficulty level showed little difference from previous years\\n\\nStarting with this year's second-half (July-December) open recruitment, Samsung only gave GSAT testing opportunities to applicants who passed the job suitability assessment. Previously, anyone could take the test without a screening process, leading to 100,000 people each time and 200,000 annually flocking to take it, earning it the nickname 'Samsung Civil Service Exam.' However, this year, a significant number were filtered out during the job suitability assessment, and the number of speculative applicants with a 'just apply and see' attitude also decreased, substantially reducing the actual number of GSAT test-takers. Jung Hyun-ho, Samsung Group's HR team leader, stated that 'the number of GSAT test-takers and testing venues decreased significantly.'\\n\\nThe exam was conducted for two hours starting at 8:30 AM at 5 domestic locations including Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju, as well as 2 overseas locations including New York and Los Angeles in the United States. GSAT consists of 5 sections: verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning, inference, visual thinking, and job knowledge, with a total of 160 questions.\\n\\nApplicants who completed the test at Apgujeong High School in Seoul unanimously agreed that the test format, structure, and difficulty level showed little difference from before the changes. However, many reacted that the history questions were challenging.\\n\\nMr. Shin (25), who applied to Samsung Electronics, said, 'I was flustered by a question asking about the genealogy of ancient Chinese history from the Spring and Autumn Warring States period-Qin-Han dynasties.' Mr. Yang (26) said, 'It was easier than commercial problem books and general knowledge was slightly more difficult compared to the first half of the year,' adding 'It was notable that the proportion of history questions increased, including questions asking to select the king who implemented the equal-field system.'\\n\\n○ Remaining challenges\\n\\nAlthough Samsung revised its hiring system last year stating it would 'prevent social waste such as excessive hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] fever,' the hagwon education problem remains an unsolved challenge. Particularly, since individual notifications about passing the job suitability assessment were given on the 7th of this month, it is known that many test-takers spent money on hagwon education for a month in anxiety after the application deadline of the 14th of last month.\\n\\nMs. Lee (24, female), who completed the test that day, said, 'Because the job suitability assessment results were announced late, I prepared for GSAT while anxiously not knowing whether I passed,' adding 'Among my friends, there were many cases where they listened to online lectures and bought and solved problem books throughout September, only to feel devastated when they failed.'\\n\\nAmong job seekers, there is also dissatisfaction that 'Samsung's open recruitment was the only test that gave everyone an opportunity, but now even that has disappeared.' Particularly, because the job suitability assessment is also perceived as a type of document screening, the vague anxiety among students from regional universities was relatively greater.\\n\\nHowever, a Samsung senior official explained, 'The job suitability assessment is different from general document screening—it is the result of years of deliberation by HR experts,' adding 'We will demonstrate through final successful candidates that hagwon education is truly unnecessary for Samsung employment and that we have not limited opportunities but rather opened them up.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3242, "output_tokens": 1074, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is the result of comprehensive influence from the admissions environment including 'easier CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam],' 'introduction of absolute grading for English,' 'expansion of student record comprehensive selection,' 'reduction of essay-writing exam selection,' and 'strengthened interviews.' Particularly, starting with current high school freshmen who will face the introduction of absolute grading for English on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], reading is expected to become even more important.\\n\\nIn fact, university admissions officers and entrance exam specialists unanimously agree that reading is important. This is because: △it can effectively reveal depth of thinking to evaluators during interviews △it can show the process of developing intellectual curiosity in connection with academic subjects △it can demonstrate the authenticity of non-curricular activities through reading. Why are these changes expected? How should students prepare?\\n\\n'Easy CSAT' impact… Regular admission↓ Early admission↑\\nWhy is reading becoming important? It's easy to understand from the university's perspective. Universities want to select excellent students. However, under the university admission policies recently promoted by the government, it's not easy to gauge whether applicants are excellent.\\n\\nFirst, the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. The trend is toward easier questions, to the point where getting just one question wrong can result in a second grade. It's not easy to judge whether an applicant is excellent based solely on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores. When English also changes to absolute grading starting from the 2018 academic year, this phenomenon is likely to intensify further.\\n\\nThen what remains is early admission. The trend is toward reducing selection numbers for essay-writing exam selection while increasing student record comprehensive selection. Seoul National University selects approximately 2,500 students solely through student record comprehensive selection in 2016 early admission. This is about 75% of total recruitment. There is no essay-writing exam selection. For the general selection within student record comprehensive selection, most departments select within twice the quota through document evaluation in the first stage, and determine final successful candidates in the second stage by reflecting 50% of first-stage scores and 50% of interviews and oral exams. Korea University is reportedly considering an admissions reform plan that reduces regular admission selection numbers while expanding student record comprehensive selection.\\n\\nLee Jong-seo, director of the Educational Evaluation Research Institute at Etoos Cheongsol, said, 'Reading is an important non-curricular activity in the sense that universities pay attention to applicants' character, philosophy, and other basic qualities in student record comprehensive selection,' adding, 'Students who have consistently read can have competitiveness in interviews because they have problem awareness about specific issues.'\\n\\nIn fact, reading is such a core evaluation factor that Seoul National University has a separate reading item in the university-specific autonomous questions for student record comprehensive selection. In a recently released guidance video for student record comprehensive selection, they also revealed that 'students who engage in related reading while studying and broaden their own thinking are the type of talent we seek to find through student record comprehensive selection.'\\n\\nReading = Interview competitiveness\\nIn student record comprehensive selection, major evaluation factors include △school records [GPA] △school club activities △school competitions △interviews, etc. Most students applying to major universities have school records [GPA] close to first grade, which is the highest level. School club activities have also recently become more leveled upward, making it difficult to stand out significantly from other applicants. Ultimately, universities are likely to strengthen interviews to confirm students' thinking ability, problem awareness, etc.\\n\\nUniversity admissions officer A from a Seoul-based university said, 'Depending on what goals the university has in selecting students, there will also be universities that want to increase the reflection ratio of interviews.'\\n\\nUniversity admissions officer B from a top-tier university in Seoul said, 'Our university evaluators basically think that if a student has read many books, the depth of thinking is revealed in what they say. We cannot deny this effect that reading has in interviews,' adding, 'Students who have read books in various fields with depth will be differentiated in interviews.'\\n\\nReading also determines the quality of detailed abilities and special notes\\nReading is also likely to be the factor that ultimately determines the 'quality' of the detailed abilities and special notes section of the school life record, which is the most important evaluation document in student record comprehensive selection.\\n\\nLim Seong-ho, representative of Jongro Academy Sky Education, said, 'Students who have developed the habit of finding and reading books related to academic subjects ask questions to their teachers after reading books and having curiosities arise. The process of discussing books with teachers will be recorded entirely in detailed abilities and special notes,' adding, 'Student record comprehensive selection is qualitative evaluation that examines the learning process, not school records [GPA] which are the results of learning. Even students with third-grade scores can sufficiently show their academic ability through reading activities.'\\n\\nUniversity admissions officer C from a top-tier university in Seoul said, 'It's true that our attention goes to students who became curious about content learned in class, found related books to read, and engaged in advanced learning during evaluation,' adding, 'If such content is faithfully recorded across reading activity status and detailed abilities and special notes in the student record, they can receive good evaluation.'\\n\\nAnother admissions officer D from a top-tier university said, 'There aren't many students who connect their activities with reading,' adding, 'Students who have the history of \\\"reading a specific book, feeling something, and doing this kind of activity\\\" can stand out in terms of major compatibility and authenticity.'\\n\\nLee Man-gi, evaluation director at Uway Jungang Education, advised, 'If you connect and prove the motivation for reading books, what you felt while reading, and behavioral changes after reading to non-curricular activities, you can have your own differentiated history.'\\n\\nReporter Kim Jae-seong kimjs6@donga.com\\nIntern reporters Lee Won-sang, Kim Su-jin\\n▶\\nOn page 2, we reveal the reading secrets of Seoul National University successful candidates and evaluation criteria of university evaluators.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4189, "output_tokens": 1521, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

'Youthful challenges' with just an idea\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"[2015 Restart] <8·End> CEOs in their 20s and 30s who chose entrepreneurship over employment\\nSelf-filming device 'Seldi'... Size-adjustable storage container 'Puzzle Lock'...\\nJung Jae-hyun, CEO of Myfob Co., Ltd., demonstrates 'Seldi,' a multi-purpose self-filming device with six functions (top). Park Hyun-jin, CEO of Puzzle Lock Co., Ltd., poses holding 'Puzzle Lock,' a size-adjustable storage container. The two established a shared office at Ansan University's startup incubation center on Ansan University Road in Sangnok-gu, Ansan, Gyeonggi Province in April and have been working in the same space. Ansan = Reporter Jeon Young-han scoopjyh@donga.com\\n\\n'Do people really have to hold their smartphones with their hands for such a long time?'\\n\\nJung Jae-hyun, CEO of Myfob Co., Ltd. (31), suddenly had this thought while riding the subway in 2012. Passengers around him were all holding smartphones and watching videos without exception. It looked uncomfortable.\\n\\nAt the time, he had quit his job at a bank after graduating from university and was preparing for graduate school entrance exams for translation and interpretation. He too would play English lectures or American dramas on his smartphone for English study whenever he traveled, holding the device by hand while watching. He thought that since you don't need to press buttons while watching videos, there's really no need to hold the smartphone by hand. An idea suddenly came to him. 'If there were a necklace-type smartphone stand, you wouldn't need to use your hands...'\\n\\nBut when he searched the internet, there was no such device. Although he didn't know much about entrepreneurship, he went to the Korean Intellectual Property Office with just his idea. After consulting with a patent attorney, he filed for a utility model the following year. While simultaneously preparing for entrance exams and developing the product, he thought: 'Now is the time to create this product!'\\n\\n○ Nurturing dreams at the entrepreneurship academy\\n\\nCEO Jung gave up on graduate school and entered the 'Youth Entrepreneurship Academy' operated by the Small and Medium Business Corporation last year. This is a program that annually selects young entrepreneurs preparing for startups, provides systematic education, and supports subsidies of up to 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] for 70% of total project costs. While receiving entrepreneurship education and interacting with fellow academy students, he began to refine his idea.\\n\\nPeople around him advised, 'How many people would use such an awkward device (necklace-type stand) on crowded public transportation?' There were also opinions that it could become a popular product if outdoor activity enthusiasts could use the necklace-type equipment to film videos hands-free.\\n\\nAfter much consideration, CEO Jung created 'Seldi,' a multi-purpose self-filming device that can mount smartphones and action cameras for self-recording, and established Myfob Co., Ltd. in October last year. For startup capital, he received about 56 million won [approximately $42,000 USD] in support from the Small and Medium Business Corporation and covered part of the costs with loans from the Korea Technology Finance Corporation. He plans to launch the product soon through crowdfunding.\\n\\nHe transformed from a 'bank employee' to an 'entrepreneur' within a few years. When he worked at the company, he would wake up at 7 AM, go to work, and leave before 7 PM, but now he goes to work at all hours and sometimes works until 2 or 3 AM. CEO Jung said, 'When I lived a routine life, I was extremely bored, but now that I'm doing what I want to do, even though my body is tired, I feel great accomplishment.'\\n\\n'Entrepreneurship is like playing a game. From conception to product launch, each stage is fun, like completing game missions and moving to the next level.'\\n\\n○ Enduring difficulties with the ambition to grow a company\\n\\nAccording to the 'Startup Company Status Survey' (based on 2012 data, companies within 7 years of startup) released this month by the Small and Medium Business Administration, people in their 20s (22,817) and 30s (243,275) account for 16% of the 1,661,481 entrepreneurs. People in their 20s in particular represent only 1.4%, an 'extremely small number.' Moreover, manufacturing startups are challenging for young people in their 20s because not only is it difficult to conceptualize ideas, but they also require significant capital and market development is not easy.\\n\\nPark Hyun-jin, CEO of Puzzle Lock Co., Ltd. (26), which makes size-adjustable storage containers, established his company last May when he was 25. In 2012, while taking a class called 'Entrepreneurship Theory' at university, he conceived of a unique storage container with the idea of creating lifestyle-oriented products. After winning an invention competition hosted by a broadcasting company in 2013, he entered the Youth Entrepreneurship Academy last year and began preparing for entrepreneurship in earnest.\\n\\nStarting a manufacturing business wasn't easy. First, it required a lot of capital. He saved money by 'not eating and not spending,' and spent a total of just over 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] as startup capital, including about 56 million won [approximately $42,000 USD] in support from the Small and Medium Business Corporation. CEO Park said, 'You can't survive if you start just thinking about making money. Getting rich quick was never the goal from the beginning of the business.'\\n\\n'My goal is for the company I'm growing to become wealthy rather than myself. I want to make products that people need, products that even our family can use with confidence and satisfaction.'\\n\\nDuring this time, he had opportunities to get jobs at companies and was confident he could enter good companies. There were hardly any friends around him who had started businesses, but after much consideration, he chose entrepreneurship. With product launch approaching soon, he faced many ups and downs meeting with older executives from client companies. He was often ignored and received unfair pricing proposals. He also had to learn specialized terminology used in manufacturing and Japanese expressions used in the field by experiencing everything firsthand.\\n\\nCEO Park laughed, saying, 'When you take the initiative in your own work, even staying up all night for several days doesn't feel difficult.' 'I believe that for the country to thrive, manufacturing must thrive. I will continue to grow the business without losing my initial resolve to the end.'\\n\\nSpecial Reporting Team\\n▽Kim Sun-mi, Deputy Chief of Consumer Economy Department (Team Leader)\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4350, "output_tokens": 1612, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

A class scene from an advanced writing course in the high school-university linked advanced program established at Seoul Women's University. Provided by Seoul Women's University\\n\\n'Take advanced courses, have them recorded on school records, and earn university credits in advance.'\\n\\nThe 'high school-university linked advanced program,' which gives high school students the opportunity to study high-level curricula at universities in advance, is seeing active participation with significantly increased enrollment based on various advantages. Through this program, high school students can complete university-level subjects in advance and have these completed subjects recognized as credits after entering university. Beyond the advantage of enabling advanced learning, interest is growing as it also helps with university admissions.\\n\\n○ Only extracurricular learning activity recorded on student records\\n\\nThe high school-university linked advanced program was created with the intent of satisfying students' achievement levels and learning desires by enabling advanced learning for high school students who have aptitude and exceptional ability in specific academic fields. The aim is to reduce hagwon education costs and provide high-level educational opportunities in public education.\\n\\nRegardless of grade level, high school students who receive recommendations from school principals or teachers can participate in this program. During summer and winter breaks, classes are held on weekdays for about 3 weeks, and during the semester, classes are conducted on Saturdays. Additionally, high school seniors who pass early admission can take courses if the program is established at the university they were accepted to. This program offers subjects according to standardized curricula so that students can receive classes of the same level and content regardless of which university they attend. Classes are offered in calculus, statistics, environmental science, history of science, computer science, writing, English composition, micro and macroeconomics, and chemistry, biology, and physics theory and experiments. Full-time university professors or instructors with extensive teaching experience teach the content at a foundational major level.\\n\\nAnother advantage of this program is that students can experience university life in advance by using university facilities such as libraries, dormitories, and student cafeterias in addition to attending classes. Full tuition support is provided to students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and students residing outside the Seoul metropolitan area who take classes at universities in their area of residence.\\n\\nSince this program is operated by the Ministry of Education to strengthen public education competitiveness, it can be usefully utilized in university admissions. The results of completing this program are the only extracurricular learning activity that can be recorded on student records. This has the advantage of clearly showing that students have interest in specific subjects and have made efforts in those areas. An official from the Korean Council for University Education said, 'High school students who take classes can verify their aptitude and potential abilities beyond vague ideas by taking foundational courses for their majors in advance.'\\n\\n○ Rapid increase in participating students and universities\\n\\nSince the introduction of the high school-university linked advanced program in 2012, both participating universities and enrolled students have increased significantly. The number of partner universities, which was only 36 schools in the first year of introduction, has grown to 81 schools this year. Partner universities are those that recognize subjects taken in this program as university credits after admission. Therefore, regardless of which university students take courses at, if they enter one of the partner universities, they can receive university credit recognition, which helps with double majors or early graduation.\\n\\nUniversities providing classes also increased from 8 in 2012 to 29 last year, and the number of operating subjects also increased from 7 subjects (2012) to 13 subjects (2014). The number of students, which was only 331 in the first year of program operation, increased to 769 in 2013 and 1,367 last year. This year, summer vacation enrollment was 626 students, more than four times the 149 students from last year. A Korean Council for University Education official explained, 'Although participation is limited as this program is provided for students who can achieve academic success in advanced courses based on interest and curiosity in specific academic fields as well as recommendations from school principals and teachers, the number of participating students more than doubles every year.'\\n\\nSatisfaction with education is also quite high. In a survey asking about program satisfaction, responses of 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' reached 89.7%. Of the 626 students who applied for summer vacation classes this year, 602 completed their classes to the end, showing a completion rate of 96.2%. By grade level, second-year students comprised the largest portion at 58.8% of participating students, followed by first-year students (29.1%) and third-year students (12.1%).\\n\\nAn Bo-yeon, who took General Physics 1 at Inha University in her first year of high school, said, 'Unlike high school classes, I felt pleasure learning specific areas of science intensively and deeply, and this became a precious experience,' adding, 'Being able to have it recorded on student records and receiving classes at a university and consulting with professors in charge at a cost lower than hagwon education is an uncommon opportunity.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3848, "output_tokens": 1209, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

When Haneul High closed its admission applications on the 27th to select 225 new students for next year, 635 students applied, showing a competition ratio of 2.82 to 1. Haneul High's admission competition ratio was 2.04 to 1 in its opening year of 2011, then 2.55 to 1 in 2012, 2.90 to 1 in 2013, and 2.28 to 1 in 2014, showing a continuous upward trend.\\n\\nParticularly, the nationwide track (20 slots), which selects middle school third-year students with excellent school records (Korean, math, English, social studies, science) from across the nation, attracted 237 applicants, recording a competition ratio of 11.85 to 1. The Incheon regional track (20 slots), which selects excellent students from Incheon, also received 138 applications, showing a competition ratio of 6.90 to 1.

However, the Incheon International Airport employee children track (80 slots) received 75 applications, making it the only track among Haneul High's five admission categories to fall short of capacity.\\n\\nThe reason applicants are flocking to Haneul High is because it has been producing outstanding results in college entrance exams every year. Previously in February, 10 out of 221 graduating students from Haneul High were accepted to Seoul National University. This was the second-highest number among 122 high schools in the Incheon region, following Incheon Science High School (12 students), a special-purpose high school that produced the most Seoul National University admissions this year.

All enrolled students live in dormitories (4-person rooms) and can return home once a month for a 2-night, 3-day visit. Teachers have designated classrooms, allowing students to receive after-school instruction from any teacher they want, regardless of grade or class. Level-based classes are conducted, and one-third of the entire curriculum is structured similarly to university-level courses.\\n\\nKim Il-hyeong, principal of Incheon Haneul High School, stated, \\\"As we produce good results in college entrance exams every year, the number of excellent new students continues to increase.\\\"\\n\\nIncheon International Airport Corporation established Haneul High School in 2011 as a community contribution project and continues to support its operation.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2653, "output_tokens": 806, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Abolishes essay-writing exam [a component of some university admissions] track in early admissions\\n\\nKorea University will select nearly half of all incoming students through high school recommendation tracks. The essay-writing exam track implemented in early admissions will be abolished. Korea University held a press briefing on the 28th and announced this admissions system reform plan.\\n\\nThis reform plan will be applied starting from the 2018 academic year when current high school freshmen apply to university. The high school recommendation track, which will select approximately 50% of the admission quota, is a system where high schools recommend students based on comprehensive evaluations by high school teachers.

It is none other than a reform of the university admissions system.\\n\\nKorea University decided to expand its school recommendation track to up to 50% of total admissions for the 2018 academic year. The school recommendation track is a system where students can apply to Korea University when their school principal recommends them based on teachers' comprehensive evaluation. Along with this, Korea University decided to abolish its essay-writing exam track and reduce both the regular admission track based mainly on CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) scores and the special talent track. The abolition of the essay-writing exam track stems from the judgment that essay exams encourage hagwon education.\\n\\nKorea University's admissions system reform aims to comprehensively evaluate students' character, integrity, and passion by increasing the weight of document screening and interviews, rather than relying solely on test scores like CSAT. Korea University explained the significance of the reform as \\\"contributing to the normalization of public education and discovering future-oriented talent.\\\" To put this more simply, it means \\\"we will broaden opportunities not just for students from specific regions like Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] or special-purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools, but also for students from general high schools or provincial schools who face difficult circumstances.\\\" The idea is to discover the potential of students who are passionate and sincere even if their current circumstances are not favorable, and students who have difficulty receiving hagwon education, and give them admission opportunities. This is based on the belief that character and integrity lead to higher achievement in university than grades at high school graduation.\\n\\nThere are also criticisms of Korea University's reform plan. First, there is the criticism that it fails to properly reflect differences in academic ability between schools. Simply put, \\\"general high schools perform worse academically than special-purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools, so why should they get the same number of recommendation slots?\\\" There are also concerns that competition between general high schools and school records [GPA] competition will intensify, and hagwon education for interviews will increase.\\n\\nHowever, from the perspective of our society's greater good and public interest, Korea University's admissions system reform deserves applause. While there may be various values and orientations in education, the core should be coexistence. Education is about teaching and learning how to live together. This means consideration for the disadvantaged.\\n\\nLooking around us, there are many cases where people want to study hard and want to raise their children with care, but cannot do so because of poor conditions such as poverty. It has become an undeniable reality that parents' economic conditions and social status determine our children's university admission results and future. Coexistence is crumbling.\\n\\nSome people worry about the proliferation of hagwon education for in-depth interviews, but universities can sufficiently solve this problem. It is not very difficult for interviewers to screen out students who learned interview techniques through hagwon education. It is possible with just the will to do so. If they screen out students who learned interview techniques by relying on hagwon education, word will spread immediately, and test-takers and parents will naturally realize that interview hagwon education is unnecessary.\\n\\nKorea University's admissions system reform plan was possible because of faith in students and the educational field. It is the belief that students with good character who work hard earnestly will pursue bigger dreams and contribute to our society, even if their circumstances and environment are poor. Prior to this, Korea University had also announced a policy to concentrate scholarships on students from difficult family circumstances rather than academically excellent students. All of this comes from consideration and coexistence.\\n\\nOur society has deliberately turned away from this basic educational philosophy. In the name of competitiveness and excellence. That is why Korea University's attempt this time cannot but be a courageous experiment. Now is the time for our society and universities to respond to that courage.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3268, "output_tokens": 930, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The infection pathway is presumed to be that the mold fungi spread throughout the building via the building's air ducts (ventilation system), causing mass infection.\\n\\nA health authority official said on the 8th, \\\"As a result of conducting an epidemiological investigation of the College of Animal Life Sciences laboratory presumed to be where the initial outbreak occurred, we found that the laboratory was conducting an animal feed decay experiment, and mold fungi appear to have grown from this.\\\" Current laboratory safety regulations do not include provisions requiring animal feed to be decayed in isolated spaces. The official also stated, \\\"We believe that when the mold fungi that grew on the animal feed reached a certain concentration level, it spread throughout the building via the building's air ducts, causing mass infection.\\\"\\n\\nFollowing this Konkuk University incident, there are successive criticisms that university laboratories are in blind spots regarding infectious disease safety. According to a Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning report on \\\"Research Laboratory Safety-Related Statistics\\\" obtained by this newspaper, numerous cases were detected of university laboratories handling microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses violating the most basic safety rules, such as leaving waste containers mixed with microorganisms uncovered, increasing the risk of airborne spread, or storing food in refrigerators dedicated to bacterial experiments, exposing people to infection risks.\\n\\nAs a result of this newspaper's interviews with 20 researchers who work in or have graduated from microbiology-related laboratories at 12 universities in the greater Seoul area, many expressed the opinion that this Konkuk University incident was foreseeable due to serious 'safety complacency' that has long existed in the field. One Konkuk University graduate student said, \\\"There's a pervasive attitude of 'it'll probably be fine' and an atmosphere of solving problems that arise from experiments in a haphazard manner.\\\"\\n\\nCriticisms also emerged that laboratory safety education lacks effectiveness. One Sungkyunkwan University graduate student said, \\\"In our school's case, laboratory safety education is conducted through online lectures, making it tend to be perfunctory,\\\" adding \\\"Safety education seminars are also held, but participation rates are low.\\\" The researchers interviewed unanimously stated, \\\"This Konkuk University incident should serve as an opportunity for university laboratory safety management handling various bacteria and viruses to be implemented as thoroughly as in foreign countries.\\\"\\n\\nShin Sun-mi, Donga Science Reporter vamie@donga.com\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2790, "output_tokens": 711, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The rebellion of ordinary people must occasionally occur for the world to be interesting.\\n\\nOf course there are. The secret they speak of can be summarized as something like 'the productivity of curiosity.' This is completely different from the 'importance of repetitive learning' that our country's college entrance exam education treats as golden rules, and even seems contradictory to it. It's also quite different from the conventional advice to set clear goals during school years and devote oneself to them.\\n\\nGerman physicist Professor Theodor Hänsch, during his 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics acceptance lecture, displayed on screen a picture that seemed to have little relation to profound physics theory. The picture showed a mother hen and chick, with appetizing feed on the right side and the hungry mother hen struggling to get close to it. However, an obstacle made of woven wood was spread before it, making her efforts pitifully futile. Meanwhile, a chick curious about what was on the opposite side of the feed left its mother and set out to explore the other direction. Wandering here and there in the wide open space, it eventually passed by the obstacle and reached the feed. Above the mother hen was written 'goal-oriented research,' and above the chick was written 'curiosity-driven research.'\\n\\nHänsch describes himself as an ordinary student with no connection to genius. He expressed in this picture the story of how such a person came to receive the Nobel Prize and rise to the ranks of great physicists. One can even read the provocative message 'throw away goals.' There's a kind of exhilaration in 'I lived led by the joy of new discoveries without any thought of achieving something (purpose), and found myself before appetizing feed (Nobel Prize).'\\n\\nProfessor Hironaka Heisuke, who won the Fields Medal—the highest award in mathematics—as the second person from Asia, also says he was an ordinary talent far from genius. His autobiography 'The Joy of Learning' shows a child who was at best a clever semi-talent growing into one of the world's greatest mathematicians. His Fields Medal-winning achievement, the abstruse research on 'resolution of singularities of algebraic varieties,' is also far from a genius of the century appearing suddenly to solve an age-old problem. Hironaka had been immersed in the Buddhist perspective that the complete world of nirvana becomes the phenomenal world full of suffering when projected into this world. The autobiography's title fits well with the message that 'joy creates achievement,' depicting the process by which philosophical contemplation led to solving mathematical problems.\\n\\nWhat stands at the opposite pole from the perspective of curiosity's productivity is repetitive learning, which, contrary to its purpose of making things familiar through repetition, makes talented children sick of it and stop at mediocre achievement. The more the same content is repeated, the more rapidly interest drops and the child's curiosity disappears somewhere. There's even pride competition over how many times famous problem books have been solved. Teachers in the field know the problems but have no choice but to avoid repetitive learning, which is their magic bullet. The college entrance exam-centered education system has created an evaluation system that requires solving many multiple-choice problems in a short time, making the structure inevitably become 'beginning-development-climax-repetitive learning.'\\n\\nSchools selectively teach parts of humanity's achievements. Among these, there are things like multiplication tables that, once memorized, can be used repeatedly to save effort. There are also things where, after learning, one can retain the basic principles or logical process of solution but may forget the detailed content. It's sufficient if one can look them up on the internet or in books when needed, or reproduce them through logical thinking processes. This is different from being good at computers and searching well—what's important is understanding what to look for to solve one's problems while having the big picture of knowledge interconnections.\\n\\nRecently I saw news that a 73-year-old retired lawyer received a physics PhD in the United States and started as a postdoctoral researcher. Having served as Seoul District Court Chief Judge, he's someone who achieved mastery in his lifelong field, but at age 66 after mandatory retirement, he entered graduate school and began studying physics. He said he wanted to fulfill his childhood dream that had to be abandoned for various worldly reasons, even if it was after retirement.

Critics point out that parental influence and hagwon education significantly impact preparation for comprehensive school records admissions, requiring improvements.\\n\\nAccording to the Korean Council for University Education on the 29th, the comprehensive school records admissions system selected only 9.6% (36,896 students) of total university admission quotas in the 2011 academic year, but has steadily increased each year, surpassing 20% in 2017, and is scheduled to select 23.7% (83,666 students) in the 2018 academic year. Particularly, the proportion of comprehensive school records admissions at 16 major universities in Seoul reaches 42.6% for the 2018 academic year.\\n\\nThe comprehensive school records admissions system is a method that evaluates applicants' aptitude, abilities, and growth potential using various materials including school records, personal statements, and teacher recommendation letters. It evaluates not only academic grades but also extracurricular activities such as club activities and volunteer work.\\n\\nThe problem is that evaluating extracurricular areas across various fields makes it possible to receive good evaluations not through students' efforts or abilities, but through hagwon education and parental assistance. A teacher in Seoul's Gangbuk [northern Seoul] region said, \\\"School competitions are much more difficult than school record exams, giving advantages to students who received hagwon education, and English speaking contests favor students with overseas living experience or early education,\\\" adding \\\"Ultimately, it's a clear fact that comprehensive school records admissions favor students with parents of high socioeconomic status.\\\"\\n\\nThe civic education group No Worries About Hagwon Education also argued that some elements included in this admissions system trigger parental intervention and hagwon education, claiming that school competitions and various certification qualifications should be excluded from evaluation. Moreover, preparing for certifications that can be included in personal statements within comprehensive school records admissions—such as 'Test of Economic Sense and Ability (TESAT),' 'Korean Language Proficiency Test,' and 'Korean History Certification'—is difficult with school curriculum alone, requiring hagwon education. Reading activities are also sometimes managed through hagwon education institutions to match the universities and majors students wish to apply for.\\n\\nThe unclear evaluation criteria for extracurricular activities is also problematic. It's difficult to gauge how much reading should be done, what club activities and how many should be pursued, or how many school awards are needed, leading to overheated competition.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2726, "output_tokens": 678, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Is it truly necessary to build up such an overwhelming level of extracurricular specs during three years of high school?\\n\\nIn-school awards and reading activities on school records are already items that many high school students prioritize and thoroughly manage. However, volunteer work does not necessarily require accumulating many hours and extensive records. Not only is it difficult to differentiate oneself with ordinary volunteer activities, but universities also do not evaluate volunteer hours as a decisive factor, even when accumulated extensively, compared to awards or reading activities.\\n\\nHow much volunteer work do Seoul National University admits do?\\n\\nJongno Academy Sky Education, which analyzed school records of some Seoul National University early admission applicants, stated, \\\"While Seoul National University may not quantitatively evaluate volunteer hours, it is true that Seoul National University applicants have many volunteer hours.\\\"\\n\\nWhen randomly selecting five general academic high school graduates who were accepted to Seoul National University through early admission this year - Ms. A (Liberal Studies), Mr. B (Chemical and Biological Engineering), Ms. C (Food and Animal Biotechnology), Mr. D (Geography), and Ms. E (Liberal Studies) - and asking about their volunteer hours, these five students averaged 120 volunteer hours. Ms. E had the most with 210 hours, while Mr. B had the least with 70 hours.\\n\\nMs. E said, \\\"I was active in the school newspaper production club during high school, and just through club activities alone I accumulated 120 volunteer hours,\\\" adding, \\\"I consistently did cafeteria volunteer assistance at school and translation volunteer work outside school, so I did over 200 hours of volunteer work.\\\"\\n\\nMr. B, who did the least volunteer work, said, \\\"I devoted a lot of time to in-school research activities and club activities, so I didn't have the capacity to invest in volunteer work,\\\" explaining, \\\"I consistently volunteered at a local children's center and did school cafeteria volunteer work, which totaled 70 hours.\\\"\\n\\nSeoul National University: \\\"Volunteer work isn't about the hours\\\"\\n\\nSeoul National University's position is that \\\"volunteer hours are not reflected in evaluation at all.\\\"\\n\\nA Seoul National University admissions officer revealed, \\\"Rather than volunteer hours, Seoul National University examines through personal statements how consistently students engaged in specific volunteer activities, what impact that volunteer work had on them, and what internal changes occurred,\\\" stating, \\\"Based on this information, we evaluate the student's community spirit and service mindset.\\\" The officer also said, \\\"We understand well that during the busy three years of high school, it's realistically impossible to devote much time to volunteer work,\\\" adding, \\\"Even if someone consistently does school cleanup activities for 10 hours per year for three years, if they felt something and experienced internal change through those 30 hours of activity, we reflect that in our evaluation.\\\"\\n\\nThe volunteer hours that individual high schools encourage all students to complete as mandatory requirements vary by school. One general academic high school in Seoul requires 4 hours over three years, while another general academic high school in Seoul mandates accumulating 10 hours per year. Students who join clubs like school broadcasting or school magazine editing can sufficiently accumulate such volunteer hours through those activities alone.\\n\\nGiven this situation, Seoul National University believes it cannot evaluate students based solely on volunteer hours.\\n\\nVolunteer work: consistently at one place\\n\\nSeoul National University admits say \\\"quality is more important than quantity in volunteer work,\\\" but also note \\\"however, to find meaning in volunteer work, you must do it deeply and consistently, so volunteer hours inevitably increase.\\\"\\n\\nMs. C, who was accepted to Seoul National University's Food and Animal Biotechnology program through early admission general track this year, did 100 hours of volunteer work during her three years of high school. Her experience volunteering as a member of the school guidance patrol was incorporated into item 3 of her personal statement. It contained her experience of contemplating whether rules that don't match reality should be followed, while worrying about students' opinions that the school rule 'prohibiting eating while walking' lacked practicality.\\n\\nMs. C said, \\\"If I hadn't done guidance patrol consistently and diligently, I wouldn't have had that contemplative experience,\\\" adding, \\\"To create meaning, it's effective to do one volunteer activity deeply rather than doing one-time, hour-filling volunteer work at various places.\\\"\\n\\nTeacher Yoon Kwon-ki from Gyeonggi Suseong High School said, \\\"One student who was accepted to Seoul National University's medical school last year had only 73 volunteer hours,\\\" explaining, \\\"This student consistently volunteered at medical institutions in connection with their career path and appropriately utilized that in college admissions.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3919, "output_tokens": 1262, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Starting next year, science and engineering enrollments will increase dramatically while humanities and social science departments will inevitably shrink, leaving liberal arts students feeling like they've been struck by lightning.\\n\\nStarting with 2017 academic year freshmen, who are currently high school seniors, engineering enrollment at 21 PRIME project selected universities will increase by 4,429 students while liberal arts enrollment will decrease by 2,500 students, making calculations complicated for both teachers and students. The universities selected for the PRIME project include Konkuk University, Sookmyung Women's University, Hanyang University (ERICA), and others - mostly places where excellent students from each high school would apply. While natural science track students are delighted that college entrance barriers have relatively widened, liberal arts students show anxious expressions, worrying about increased competition rates.\\n\\nBecause liberal arts enrollment at project-selected universities is decreasing, girls' high schools, which have a larger proportion of liberal arts students compared to co-educational or boys' schools, are expected to face greater impact. A principal at a girls' high school in Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul said, \\\"We organized senior science track students into 4 classes and liberal arts into 9 classes, and for juniors we added one more science class to make 5 and 9 classes respectively,\\\" adding \\\"Liberal arts is twice the size of science track, but we're worried because humanities and social science enrollment suddenly decreased.\\\" He also said, \\\"At least high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Seocho, and Mok-dong areas and autonomous private high schools have been increasing science classes in response to this trend for several years, but among girls' high schools in Gangbuk areas, there are still places where the liberal arts to science ratio reaches about 8 to 2, putting college entrance guidance on emergency alert.\\\" Currently, among all Seoul area high schools, general high schools (198 schools) have liberal arts at 63.9%. In contrast, private autonomous high schools (23 schools) have 55.8% science track, more than liberal arts.\\n\\nAs the trend toward expanding science and engineering continues, some liberal arts students are also considering changing their career paths to departments where cross-application from liberal arts to natural sciences is possible. In the 2017 academic year admissions, some universities including some natural science departments at Catholic University, Korea University's nursing college and computer science department, Seoul National University's nursing college and clothing studies department allow liberal arts students to cross-apply to natural science tracks. Movement toward career adjustment is detected even among current first and second-year high school students who are not immediately affected by next year's admissions. One liberal arts test-taker planning to apply to Kyung Hee University's hotel management department said, \\\"Although Kyung Hee University was not selected for the PRIME project, the trend toward liberal arts reduction seems likely to continue,\\\" adding \\\"I'm considering changing my career path because I'm worried about what would happen if after admission my department gets merged with some unrelated department.\\\"\\n\\nCollege entrance experts advised that changing career paths due to enrollment changes from the PRIME project would likely result in greater losses. Lim Seong-ho, representative of Jongno Academy Sky Education [a major hagwon chain], said, \\\"Liberal arts students who cross-apply to natural science tracks are absolutely disadvantaged in grade competition,\\\" adding \\\"Even if they manage to pass after changing career paths, there's a high possibility they'll give up their studies midway due to poor fit with their aptitude, or return to retaking [the CSAT] after one semester or one year.\\\" Universities selected for the PRIME project are reportedly considering measures to allow cross-application to newly established or expanded departments to reduce disadvantages for liberal arts test-takers.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3015, "output_tokens": 935, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

A college admissions briefing at an entrance exam hagwon last year. Dong-A Ilbo DB\\n\\nThe timing for starting 'half-year' [bansu] - preparing for entrance exams again while attending university - is becoming unusually early this year. While half-year preparation typically began around summer vacation after first semester finals, this year an increasing number of cases are starting right after first semester midterms.\\n\\nOn online communities frequented by college entrance exam students such as 'Orbi' and 'Sumanhwi,' posts related to half-year preparation have been noticeably increasing since late April. Many of these are inquiry posts asking 'How can I balance first semester university life with half-year preparation?' and 'I hear the 2017 college admissions system has changed a lot - wouldn't it be too late to start now?'\\n\\nThe reasons why half-year preparation timing has become particularly early this year can be summarized into two main factors. First, the considerable changes to this year's CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] appear to be having an impact. 'Korean History mandatory' is particularly decisive. Until now, only Seoul National University required Korean History on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], so very few students prepared Korean History for the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. Indeed, many posts are appearing on online communities saying they are rushing their half-year preparation due to the burden of having to newly study Korean History to take this year's CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. Changes due to curriculum revision - Korean language being integrated for liberal arts and science tracks on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], and changes to the science track's mathematics testing scope - are also making those considering half-year preparation hurry.\\n\\nThe 2016 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] being more difficult than expected is also cited as a cause for earlier half-year preparation. Hagwon industry sources view that because last year's suddenly difficult CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] caused high school seniors to be unable to overcome anxiety and apply to excessively lower-tier schools in regular admissions, the number of half-year applicants is also increasing.\\n\\nReflecting this trend, repeat test-taker hagwons are also moving up their half-year student recruitment timing. Unlike previous years when they started recruiting for half-year classes after the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation's June mock evaluation, they are competing to hold explanation sessions and online lectures targeting half-year students starting from May.\\n\\nMegastudy held a '2017 Half-year Student Special Lecture' on the 4th, targeting students who prepare for entrance exams through internet lectures while attending university. They are attracting half-year students by providing a 6-month step-by-step program and giving Korean History textbooks for free. Seven Megastudy offline hagwons in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Noryangjin, and other locations are also scheduled to open half-year classes starting in June.\\n\\nSky Edu plans to hold a '2017 Half-year Success Briefing' at Seoul COEX on the 15th and provide one-on-one half-year consulting. Cheongsol Academy will hold half-year class explanation sessions on the 21st at their Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] hagwon in Seoul and on the 28th at their hagwon in Ilsan, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2936, "output_tokens": 1023, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Regionally, Daegu and Gwangju formed a two-way rivalry.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education and Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation announced the analysis results of 2016 CSAT scores on the 23rd. Of the total 585,332 test-takers, male students comprised 299,775 and female students 285,557. Additionally, current students (high school seniors) numbered 449,058, graduates including repeat test-takers and half-year repeat students totaled 124,858, with the remainder being other test-takers including those with high school equivalency certificates.\\n\\nThe analysis results showed that female student dominance continued in this CSAT as well. Analysis of standard score averages across five areas - Korean A&B, Math A&B, and English - revealed that female students scored higher than male students in all areas except Math B (primarily for science track students). In terms of the 'percentage of students in grades 1 and 2' for each area, male students outnumbered female students in Korean A and Math B, while female students were more numerous in the remaining areas (Korean B, Math A, English). This somewhat validates the education sector's conventional wisdom that male students have advantages in calculation and mathematical areas, while female students excel in Korean and foreign languages. A high school teacher in Gyeonggi Province said, 'At high school sites, the atmosphere is already such that male students can't match female students in school records [GPA], and female students' scores are noticeably improving in mock exams and CSAT as well.'\\n\\nThis year, repeat test-takers again performed better than current students. Across all five areas, repeat test-takers scored higher on average than current students. The largest score gap between repeat test-takers and current students was in Korean B, where current students scored 97.9 points and repeat test-takers 108.3 points, a difference of 10.4 points.\\n\\nWhen divided between large cities and rural/fishing areas, large city students showed superiority in all areas. In Korean, English, and Math, scores were highest in large cities, followed by small and medium cities, then towns and villages, with Math B showing the largest gap between large cities at 102.0 points and towns/villages at 90.2 points. This is attributed to the concentration of hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] institutions, specialized high schools, and autonomous private high schools in large cities.\\n\\nBy province/metropolitan city, Jeju (Korean A, Math A&B, English), Gwangju (Korean B), and Daegu (English) had the highest standard score averages. However, Jeju has a relatively advantageous position in score calculation due to its small number of test-takers (5,409) compared to other provinces/cities due to population characteristics. Excluding Jeju, the regions with the highest average scores across the five CSAT areas were Daegu (Korean A, English) and Gwangju (Korean B, Math A&B). Daegu traditionally has high educational fervor in Suseong District comparable to Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area, and Gwangju also has prestigious schools like Songwon High School, which appears to have produced these results.\\n\\nAdditionally, the evaluation institute stated, 'High schools with students who have more conversation time with parents and good relationships with friends at school tended to have higher CSAT scores,' and 'Schools with higher ratios of students who actively participate in class and study independently with textbooks also had better CSAT scores.' The evaluation institute explained, 'To prevent regional ranking and university admissions overheating side effects, we did not conduct regional score analysis at the city/county/district level this time,' and 'We also will not announce the top 30 cities/counties/districts by CSAT scores that we released in previous years.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2996, "output_tokens": 995, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He argued that it's unfair to limit only hagwons to 10 PM when 22.6% of Seoul high schools conduct evening self-study sessions past 10 PM.\\n\\nCouncilman Park will hold a debate on adjusting hagwon class hours and the mandatory hagwon closure system on the 26th at the Seoul City Council member hall, hosted by the Education Committee, and plans to propose the amendment next month unless there are major objections.\\n\\n○ \\\"Current Study Hours Are Already Excessive\\\"\\n\\nHowever, opposition is fierce even before the debate. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education plans to submit an opinion letter if Councilman Park proposes the amendment. The content states: \\\"While we agree with categorizing hagwon class hours by students' developmental stages, we oppose extending class hours for high school students. For elementary students, 7-8 PM would be appropriate, and for middle school students, it's necessary to shorten the current class hours (10 PM).\\\"\\n\\nA Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education official said, \\\"Setting maximum class hours by school level could be understood as the education office officially declaring appropriate study time, so we must be cautious,\\\" adding, \\\"Even when hagwons end at 10 PM, students go home, wash up, and do homework, falling asleep past midnight. If extended to 11 PM, even the brief time for conversation with parents would disappear.\\\"\\n\\nThe education office pointed out that the class hour restriction regulation maintained since 1991 is based on educational judgment. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare last November, Korean children and adolescents (ages 15-24) study for 7 hours and 50 minutes, ranking first among OECD countries. The gap is significant even compared to second-place Sweden (5 hours 55 minutes). A Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education official stated, \\\"Many hagwons currently operate past 10 PM and ask why they aren't cracked down on, but we can't just adjust laws to match reality,\\\" adding, \\\"Students already study too much and lack rest, so we oppose changing the ordinance to extend class hours.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding the mandatory hagwon closure system, they noted, \\\"If hagwons choose their own closure days, it becomes difficult for the education office to conduct unified inspections, and other hagwons could open special classes, creating problems.\\\"\\n\\nNo Worries About Private Education [a civic education organization] plans to hold a press conference in front of the city council on the afternoon of the 26th, stating, \\\"The amendment responds to the hagwon industry's constant attempts to neutralize the 10 PM regulation\\\" and \\\"Students exhausted by excessive hagwon education will be unable to focus on school classes, weakening public education.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, there are many who point out that simply restricting hagwon hours is not the solution. Ms. Shin (49), a parent of a high school student, said, \\\"Due to regulations, many continue hagwon classes by moving to cafes after 10 PM,\\\" adding, \\\"While it's unfortunate that children study late, their study hours don't change, so just ending hagwons at 10 PM doesn't guarantee students' rest.\\\" Jo Mi-hee, president of the National Supplementary Education Council, also pointed out, \\\"Class hour restrictions actually increase illegal late-night tutoring and activate an underground economy that doesn't appear in hagwon education cost statistics.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3960, "output_tokens": 1480, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Of course, it goes in the reading activity section, but it's important to remember that student record sections are not disconnected from each other—they are organically connected to comprehensively reveal that student.\\nReading activities can be recorded in the career aspiration rationale section as books that provided the catalyst for choosing that career path. The same goes for the creative experiential activities section. Students can choose books as subject matter for club activities to explore, or reading may have been a major catalyst or turning point for specific volunteer activities. If reading influenced career setting and maturity, it can also be recorded in the career activities section. In the subject-specific abilities and special notes section, it's good to record impressions after reading books related to 'subject classes.'\\nThe reading activity section should detail what was learned and felt through such reading. Record which parts of the book resonated, what new information was gained, and how it changed one's thoughts and actions. For books to be read in the future, it's a good method to classify and record them as subject-related books, major-related books, liberal arts books, etc. Particularly, since the reading activity section records reading activities by subject, if English is divided into English 1 and English Reading in one semester, different reading activities can be recorded for each.\\nIt would be good if book titles and content that match the student's characteristics are recorded in detail in the behavioral characteristics and comprehensive opinion section as well.\\n\\n○ Career Activities, School Competition Participation... Work Hard Even in Senior Year\\n\\\"There are many school events before final exams—what should I do first?\\\"\\nThis is a time when many events like festivals, trips, school competitions, and performance assessments [school-based assessment] take place at each school. Should seniors only 'prepare for CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]'? Maybe not. Now, when various school activities are taking place, is a good time to supplement student record writing for the last time.\\nFirst, career planning. At this time when senior year career hopes and aspiration rationales haven't been written yet, think more specifically about your career path. And make your aspiration rationale and development process more concrete. Connect creative experiential activities at school, classes, books or movies you've seen to your career path. For example, a student dreaming of becoming a diplomat could scrap English newspapers about the Oxy incident during club activity time, present in English, and then participate in club competitions to achieve good results. Such career-related matters can also be recorded in the subject-specific abilities and special notes section and the behavioral characteristics and comprehensive opinion section.\\nIt's natural to diligently prepare school records [GPA] to receive subject excellence awards. In addition to this, aim for academic competitions and group club awards related to your career. Particularly, group awards achieved through collaboration can show value beyond individual awards. Even now, set club themes, write proposals, and participate in school competitions. The growth process during participation will also be revealed. This process can also be shown in the subject-specific abilities and special notes section and the behavioral characteristics and comprehensive opinion section.\\n\\n○ Develop the Habit of Recording Even Small Activities\\nTo write a comprehensive student record admission personal statement, you need to recall in detail what you experienced during specific activities. For memorable cases among the many school activities you've participated in so far, such as small-scale theme trips and sports competitions, briefly write down your role and what you learned and felt. This will be very useful for filling out personal statement question 2: 'Write about 3 meaningful activities during your 3 years of high school.' If you record all activities that took place at school during the first semester in the creative experiential activities section, connecting what you learned and felt to your curiosity, career-related matters, future activity plans, and even reading lists, it will become a substantial student record. Since memories fade over time and the emotions of that moment disappear, carefully record your changes through activities.\\nStudent records should become a place for recording and refining the greatness felt in daily life. After discovering yourself in all the small daily routines at school, fill your student records with meaning toward your dreams. Don't forget that all sections of student records must be organically connected to show growth.\\n\\nWritten by Park Ki-cheol, Director of Park Sam Edu hagwon [Seoul Gwanak-gu Sillim-dong]\\n- Uway Central Education Admissions Consultant\\n- Future Education Designer Group Education Committee Member\\n- Education Group Big Forest Admissions Director\\n- CareerNet Online Career Counseling Expert Panel\\n- Park Sam Edu All That Admissions Representative\\nDonga.com Education Section Reporter Kim Jae-seong\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3772, "output_tokens": 1110, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Recently in Britain, when grade inflation in A-Levels (high school graduation qualification exams and university entrance exams) became severe, Oxford and Cambridge universities began selecting students through their own separate examinations.\\n\\nNowadays in Korea, school principals and teachers are facing criticism for committing academic misconduct such as leaking exam questions, switching answer sheets, and manipulating scores. Such grade inflation and evaluation corruption transcends time and place.\\n\\nHowever, the nationwide prevalence of grade inflation and evaluation corruption is causing a collapse in trust toward schools and teachers, and is unnecessarily fueling hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry]. Moreover, it causes unnecessary social costs such as the implementation of high school ranking systems.\\n\\nAmid this situation, on the 10th, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development announced a 'Comprehensive Plan for Academic Performance Management.' The measures to permanently exclude teachers who manipulate grades from the teaching profession, impose administrative disadvantages on schools where academic misconduct occurs or grades are inflated, and hold school principals jointly responsible are necessary measures. The decision to conduct pilot teacher evaluations starting this year along with 'ethics awareness training' for teachers, and to gradually introduce them from 2006, is also welcome.\\n\\nOrganized CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] cheating and subsequent grade manipulation incidents have resulted in undermining trust in education. Last year's scene of students who participated in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] cheating using mobile phones being escorted to the police station with their heads bowed. Dong-A Ilbo file photo\\n\\nHowever, this plan seems to focus on preventing misconduct during the exam process, such as deploying two supervising teachers, involving parents as assistant supervisors, and conducting separate morning and afternoon sessions by grade level. What's truly important is addressing evaluation corruption such as grade manipulation, but measures for this are quite inadequate. Concrete measures are needed to eradicate grade-related corruption systematically perpetrated by schools, teachers, students, and parents, including protection for whistleblowers and internal informants regarding academic misconduct. Additionally, rather than just disclosing evaluation plans and exam questions on school websites, sufficient exam information such as correct answer rates by question, average scores, grade distributions, and past exam questions from the last three years should be provided together for effectiveness.\\n\\nThe participation of parents as assistant supervisors also needs reconsideration. Parents who are actually 'mobilized' not only feel burdened but complain that they are like 'borrowed scarecrows' when participating as supervisors. There are also concerns about infringement on teaching authority. Moreover, this idea is premised on distrust of children from the start. We should instead learn from many schools that maintain the tradition of 'unsupervised exams' and value honor. For schools to maintain strict academic management, parents' attitudes are truly important. 'Casual studying = good grades' makes children view the world too lightly and think life is too easy. Parents must stop the shameful act of 'ruining their children' by forcing schools to manipulate and inflate grades. If they truly want their children to succeed, they should tell schools like King Yeongjo's advice: 'Teacher, please don't try to curry favor with the children, but evaluate them strictly so they can study diligently!'\\n\\nKim Jang-jung, Vice President of the Parents' Coalition for Realizing Human Education\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3120, "output_tokens": 884, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Even when we clash and get red-faced over differing opinions, we find ourselves on the same side before this common denominator, wielding our whips toward education authorities and schools while echoing each other's grievances. After pouring out the unfair experiences and damages our own children have suffered, we present swift solutions like cutting through a tangled mess.\\n\\nUsually, there are two types. Solutions to simultaneously resolve the excessive but completely unchanging hagwon education problem and the university admissions system that's harder to decipher than a random number table. It's simple. For hagwon education, they say don't think too hard about it—just prohibit it by law. Those in their 40s and 50s who experienced the tutoring ban during the Chun Doo-hwan regime raise their voices saying, \\\"What can't be done? Just do it.\\\" They say the complex admissions system is also a matter that can be simply resolved by letting students enter universities based solely on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores. It feels like beating evil with the club of justice, but I wonder whether this would truly make the children of this land happy. Even during the iron-fisted Chun Doo-hwan regime, tutoring didn't completely disappear. If universities admitted students based solely on CSAT scores, it's obvious that the hagwon education market would catch fire even more. It's hard to empathize with the idea of abolishing diverse early admission programs that nurture each student's strengths to prevent them from becoming 'slaves to scores,' and returning to the admissions system of 20-30 years ago that made students focus solely on entrance exam preparation.\\n\\nThe answer to such problems is 'normalization of public education.' Schools just need to teach well—whether it's academics or arts and physical education—so that hagwon education becomes unnecessary. The admissions system may be complex, but is it really that difficult for homeroom teachers to find suitable programs for each individual student in their class?\\n\\nMany student parents are curious about how many points teachers would score if they took the CSAT in the same year as their students. When asked, teachers either get annoyed first, or face endless criticism about school classes being at an incomparably low level compared to internet lectures, but there are no politicians or ministers who want to fix this aspect.\\n\\nIf we demanded that incompetent teachers be eliminated and that teachers work harder so all education takes place within schools, there would obviously be organized backlash centered on teachers' organizations. With the kind of boldness that would close down various hagwons operating normally, we could reasonably make the same demands of teachers, yet Gyeonggi Governor Nam Kyung-pil is only beating up on hagwons. All that's needed is to firmly establish a teacher evaluation framework and make the ordinary common sense of school teachers—not hagwon instructors—teaching children become the norm.\\n\\nWhile talking about the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, can we call it education when we still demand familiarity with memorization-focused, rapid arithmetic operations instead of fostering creativity? Given this reality, various presidential candidates are competing to raise their voices about abolishing education policies or authorities. Looking at authorities that can't properly manage shoddy admissions or even respond adequately to history textbook issues, this seems understandable at first glance. However, education isn't something where new flesh suddenly sprouts if you cut it off with a single stroke.\\n\\nThe tangled threads of half-hearted reforms must be unraveled one by one to find their proper form. The more skilled a renowned doctor is at complex and difficult surgeries, the more they persistently stick to the task—taking time and effort rather than making one big cut—precisely excising only the cancerous mass to reduce side effects and save the patient. This is why we must support and vote for candidates who, rather than simply advocating easy abolition, will take the difficult path of meticulously repairing broken public education. I hope that from now on, various presidential candidates will set aside grandiose 'abolition pledges' and embark on the 'path of educational repair,' even if it takes some effort.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3299, "output_tokens": 1020, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He said, \\\"We will overcome the crisis facing universities, including employment difficulties, by creating an environment where creative and challenging attempts can flourish naturally.\\\" Photo by Kim Kyung-je, kjk5873@donga.com\\n\\nYonsei University President Kim Yong-hak (64, sociology professor), marking his first anniversary in office, mentioned the word \\\"startup\\\" more than twenty times during a 90-minute interview with Dong-A Ilbo on the 15th. His deep concerns were evident about how even graduates of the prestigious private university Yonsei face the reality that the \\\"employment cliff\\\" is not just someone else's problem. President Kim emphasized, \\\"Universities will no longer be knowledge transmitters but will play a role in discovering and managing individual capabilities,\\\" adding, \\\"Prestigious universities must abandon the privileges they once enjoyed and open various paths of challenge to students.\\\" We heard about the achievements and reflections since he became head of his alma mater on February 1 last year, as well as his future vision.\\n\\n○ Toward a Noisy Library Stocked with 'Human Books'\\n\\nPresident Kim said a 'noisy library' is needed to create a university culture that encourages startups. He meant that libraries should not be solitary spaces focused on books, but should become breeding grounds for startup networks where students can meet mentors who can vividly share their experiences.\\n\\nPresident Kim said, \\\"The era of studying alone while concentrating on books is over. Just as one visits the library to find books when academically curious, I will transform it into a library where students can meet startup mentors—what we might call 'human books'—when they want to start businesses but have questions.\\\" To this end, he plans to remodel the first-floor rest area of the Academic Information Center (library) on Sinchon campus into a startup mentoring space, opening in May. The policy is to enable students dreaming of startups to meet current industry professionals and entrepreneurial seniors there.\\n\\nFor university students, startups mean venture companies. President Kim emphasized that for many successful venture companies to emerge, \\\"universities must transform into tropical rainforest-like environments.\\\" He meant that while universities have been agricultural societies that harvest one fruit (result) from one seed (research), future universities should become tropical rainforests where all possible types of seeds are sown and various challenges bear fruit.\\n\\n\\\"Just as you don't know what seeds will fall and what fruits will grow in a tropical rainforest, the goal is to create an environment where ideas can grow naturally. My greatest wish would be to see a venture company established by Yonsei students with annual sales of 2 trillion won [approximately $1.5 billion USD].\\\"\\n\\nYonsei University has been running various programs supporting startups for undergraduate and graduate students since last year. One such program provides activity funding for two months when first-year students form small-scale project research teams. For graduate students, the university collected convergent research ideas that break down academic boundaries between humanities, engineering, and medical schools, providing research funding to 23 teams.\\n\\n○ \\\"Creativity Comes from Networks\\\"\\n\\nBefitting a master of social network theory, President Kim emphasizes teaching methods that value connectivity with others to draw out creativity. This aligns with his argument against studying alone with just books. The underlying idea is that startups can be achieved more easily through social networks.\\n\\nLast semester, 95 classes were held where students studied course content in advance and solved problems through discussion only in the classroom. President Kim said, \\\"For example, if a class discusses 'fake news,' students must study what recent incidents occurred, what theoretical approaches are relevant, and how to eradicate it in order to participate in class.\\\"\\n\\nSince last year, he has been actively encouraging not only students but also professors to utilize MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms that connect with universities worldwide. President Kim emphasized, \\\"A 'Smartphone Application Programming' course uploaded by a Yonsei professor ranked in the top 10 popular MOOC lectures worldwide,\\\" adding, \\\"Professors think about lectures that students worldwide might be interested in, and students can watch lectures uploaded by scholars from around the world.\\\"\\n\\nStarting in the second semester, a 'Signature Class Program' will be launched together with Korea University. 'Star' professors from both universities will jointly open courses where Korea University and Yonsei students attend classes in the same space. For instance, a Korea University business professor and a Yonsei philosophy professor would offer lectures on business ethics. Joint textbooks are also being developed. President Kim said, \\\"Ultimately, this 'struggle' by both schools is related to the crisis in university education,\\\" adding, \\\"President Yeom Jae-ho of Korea University and I are discussing closely to change the phenomenon where university freshmen continue as high school 'fourth-year students' due to the rigid educational culture of the entrance exam system.\\\"\\n\\n○ Management Philosophy Embodying the 3C Spirit\\n\\nAll of President Kim's plans stem from a management philosophy called '3C.' The 3C stands for the first letters of Christianity, Creativity, and Connectivity. Putting Christianity first is intended to emulate the founding spirit of missionary Horace Grant Underwood, Yonsei University's founder. President Kim explained, \\\"Just as Severance Medical School [predecessor of Yonsei's medical school] produced the first Western-style doctor from a butcher's son at the end of the Joseon period, social contribution should come first.\\\"\\n\\nYonsei University will launch the Global Social Contribution Institute on April 10, the school's founding anniversary, becoming the first domestic university to have an organization overseeing the school's social contribution activities. It will integrate domestic and international social contribution activities of medical centers, welfare centers, and youth cultural centers with annual budgets exceeding 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD]. President Kim said, \\\"While it's important for students to differentiate themselves through knowledge and creativity, the foundation is character,\\\" adding, \\\"Please watch Yonsei University maintain its role as an educational institution that nurtures global talent with ethical consciousness and sustains Korean society.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4438, "output_tokens": 1531, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This year again, lifelong learners in their 70s and 80s have received honorary diplomas or entered universities as freshmen, creating scenes of glory and challenge.\\n\\n○ Challenges that forget age\\n\\nFormer Wonju Mayor Han Sang-cheol\\n\\nAt the graduation ceremony held at Korea National Open University's Wonju City Learning Center on the 26th, former Wonju Mayor Han Sang-cheol (78), who is approaching 80, will receive his diploma. Former Mayor Han transferred into the Chinese Language and Literature Department as a third-year student in 2015 and graduated with excellent grades averaging an A after two years of study. Having already received master's and doctoral degrees from Korea University Law School, Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Administration, and Kangwon National University Graduate School respectively, his decision to challenge Chinese Language and Literature again stemmed from his experience during his tenure as the second popularly elected Wonju mayor. While promoting exchanges with Chinese local governments, he felt a thirst to examine China in greater detail.\\n\\nOvercoming the frustration that comes with age was the problem. He had to work tremendously hard to memorize words and sentences that he would forget as soon as he turned away. Rising from dawn to dedicate himself to studying, he emphasized, \\\"When Korea is unified, the country we will have to share a border with across an even wider area will be China. I plan to work to promote friendship with them in the future.\\\" Korea National Open University plans to present him with the 'Lifelong Learning Award' given to mature students on that day.\\n\\n○ Graduates who elevated their schools draw attention\\n\\nMs. Jo Jeong-yeon visiting the school for the entrance ceremony. She said, \\\"Using my social welfare studies as an opportunity, I will now live a life for others.\\\" Photo provided by Hannam University\\n\\nMs. Jo Jeong-yeon, who entered Hannam University's Social Welfare Department as a freshman at the entrance ceremony on the 21st, is 70 years old this year. Having graduated as valedictorian from Daejeon Girls' High School's correspondence program, she applied through the general admission track that selects students 100% based on high school GPA [school records] in rolling admissions and was accepted.\\n\\nMs. Jo, who obtained a real estate agent license in 1999 and operated a real estate brokerage office for 15 years, closed her business in 2013 and visited local welfare centers and Daejeon Citizens' University to learn choir, computers, billiards, and kkwaenggwari [traditional Korean percussion instrument] while participating in volunteer activities whenever possible. Her thirst for learning remained unquenched, so she entered the correspondence high school in 2014. She spent three years attending school twice a month on Sundays from 9 AM to 5 PM and taking internet lectures on weekdays. As a result, she ranked first in her entire school at the graduation ceremony on the 5th and received the honorary Daejeon Metropolitan Office of Education Superintendent's Award. Even while studying, she made time to obtain a chef's license and completed 'hospice education' at Chungnam National University Hospital, stating, \\\"Now I will study social welfare to do volunteer work more systematically.\\\"\\n\\nAt Mokwon University's graduation ceremony, Mr. Jung Jin-il (Daejeon branch manager of Disability Welfare Newspaper) drew attention by receiving an honorary diploma in recognition of his contributions to helping the university's Social Welfare Department's disability experience events despite his severe disability. Meanwhile, graduates who elevated their schools' honor also stood out. Soonchunhyang University announced that two doctoral graduates from the Biology Department, Kang Se-won (37) and Park So-young (32), were hired as full-time researchers at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and the Nakdonggang National Institute of Biological Resources, embarking on careers as scientists. Daejeon University announced that Jang Hyeon-jeong (37), who graduated from the doctoral program in Physical Therapy, obtained a physical therapist license in New York State, USA.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3153, "output_tokens": 1051, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Only Hagwons Teaching Tricks Are Bustling\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"[The Collapse of Mathematics] <1> Crumbling Math Public Education\\n\\nMr. Kim, a math school teacher at a regular high school in Seoul, takes a deep breath every time he enters the classroom. It's to endure the suffocating scene that unfolds when he opens the classroom door. Even after teaching enthusiastically for an hour, only one or two students are paying attention. \\\"The kids don't listen to class. It's the same whether it's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] or Gangbuk. Top students don't listen because they've done advance learning, bottom students can't understand due to lack of basic learning ability. I teach to middle-tier students, but these kids have no motivation for math anyway since they can't get into in-Seoul universities that require high math scores.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Gu, another math school teacher at a regular high school in the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area, faces a similar situation. He said, \\\"About a third of each class sleeps, but that's still better since it's a science track class,\\\" sighing as he added, \\\"Liberal arts classes are much more serious. More than half are kids who already gave up on math from middle school.\\\" Teacher Gu said, \\\"Since I can't provide customized lessons anyway, I just let them sleep. That's the best I can do.\\\"\\n\\n○ School Classes Running on Empty, Students Go to Hagwons to Survive\\n\\nMathematics isn't just painful for teachers teaching to thin air and children who have to 'kill time.' Even students who are good at math complain that \\\"math is boring\\\" and \\\"I don't know why I have to do this.\\\"\\n\\nStudent Song, who got only one question wrong in last year's CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) math section, which was evaluated as an 'extremely difficult CSAT,' is considered a math prodigy in Seoul's Mok-dong, known for its high educational fervor. In last year's CSAT, he solved 28 out of 30 math problems in 30 minutes when given 100 minutes. However, Song said, \\\"The reason I got high scores wasn't because I had good understanding of principles or application skills, but because I practiced identifying problem types and fast calculation countless times,\\\" adding \\\"To get high scores, you need to immediately recognize what type of formula to use the moment you see a problem.\\\"\\n\\nThe characteristic of Korean-style math assessment is that you must solve 'many problems quickly within a short time.' Only getting the answer matters, and mostly the solution process isn't graded nor are partial points recognized. In school exams, one or two high-difficulty problems that go beyond the curriculum or require advance learning always appear. This is because students must be 'ranked.'\\n\\n○ Economic Gaps Become Hagwon and Academic Achievement Gaps\\n\\nWhat's needed to avoid becoming a 'math dropout' (one who gave up on mathematics) is 'tricks' and 'type identification,' but schools don't teach these methods. This is why students have no choice but to go to hagwons to get high scores.\\n\\nCurrently, mathematics is the subject with the largest share in Korea's middle and high school hagwon education market. According to a 2015 Statistics Korea survey released last year, 42.5% of domestic households provide math hagwon education to their children. Hagwon education participation rates are proportional to household economic income. When household average monthly income was less than 1 million won [approximately $750 USD], math hagwon education participation was 13.2%, but as income increased by 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] increments, math hagwon education participation rates continued to increase to 23.4%, 33.8%, 42.0%, 48.0%, 51.5%, and 54.4%. When monthly income was 7 million won [approximately $5,250 USD] or more, the participation rate was 56.4%, 4.3 times higher than households with monthly income under 1 million won [approximately $750 USD].\\n\\nStudent Jung, who is about to enter elementary school this year, attends three math hagwons per week alone. These include a thinking skills math hagwon that supposedly develops 'thinking power,' a calculation hagwon that trains calculation tricks, and a hagwon that helps with advance learning for curriculum preparation including word problems. Parent Ms. Lee said, \\\"Three math sessions per week is average level in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry],\\\" adding \\\"Especially calculation math is essential from kindergarten. Even though the child dislikes it, the effects are so good we can't quit.\\\"\\n\\nAnother Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area parent, Ms. Kim, said, \\\"Recently science and engineering fields are trending, and since English became absolute evaluation in this year's CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], mothers' interest in math hagwon education has increased even more,\\\" conveying that \\\"If the past ratio of English to math hagwons was 3 to 2, now the trend is to reduce one English class and add one more math class.\\\"\\n\\nHigh school teacher Mr. Kim said, \\\"From what I see in the field, economic gaps and whether students attend hagwon education are directly connected to math assessment results,\\\" adding \\\"Sometimes I see middle-tier kids with outstanding mathematical thinking ability, but realistically on tests, these kids can't surpass the scores of children who've done 2-3 years of advance learning.\\\"\\n\\nSuccess or failure in college entrance exams also depends on hagwons. Mr. Lee, who attends a prestigious engineering college in Seoul and graduated from a regular high school in Guri, Gyeonggi Province, said, \\\"My life's math teacher is online instructor Mr. S,\\\" asserting \\\"If it weren't for Mr. S, I absolutely couldn't have gone to college.\\\" He said, \\\"I'm not disrespecting school teachers, but listening only to school classes, you absolutely cannot get high scores whether on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] or school tests,\\\" adding with a bitter smile, \\\"If you told school teachers to take the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], there wouldn't be anyone who could get a perfect score.\\\"\\n\\n○ \\\"Current Math Education Is Neither Math nor Education\\\"\\n\\nWhile school classes aim for principles and basic concepts, assessments pursue application and high difficulty. In this contradiction, children who can't afford hagwons or can't adapt to speed-focused problem-solving assessments end up giving up on mathematics entirely.\\n\\nProfessor Lee Yong-hoon of Busan University's Department of Mathematics said, \\\"Korea's math assessment focuses on calculation and speed, but strictly speaking, this isn't mathematics,\\\" shaking his head as he added, \\\"Even though both my wife and I are math professors, our child gave up on math when they entered high school.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Kim Jung-han of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study's Department of Computational Sciences analyzed, \\\"Mathematics becomes a subject with too much to memorize once it starts becoming a memorization subject,\\\" adding \\\"Mathematics becomes the most difficult subject when rote learning education and assessment that involves memorizing problem types and formulas takes place, which is why math dropouts emerge first among all subjects.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4334, "output_tokens": 1768, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He had a buzz cut and his face was prominently printed on his t-shirt. Despite his appearance(?), his way of speaking was simple and folksy. The merchants seemed familiar with him, casually showing him their sales receipts and chatting about market affairs.\\n\\nHe is the founder of 'Mermaid Cult Pirate Group,' which provides daily market price information for major seafood markets including Noryangjin Fish Market and Garak Market. It's a site that publishes prices from traditional markets that don't operate on fixed pricing through blogs and applications. The unique company name was created by randomly combining words that evoke the sea. The company partners with over 300 stores across approximately 70 traditional markets nationwide, and about 20,000 consumers use Mermaid Cult Pirate Group daily.\\n\\nHe launched Mermaid Cult Pirate Group in 2013. After graduating from Sogang University with a degree in Chinese studies, he worked as a securities trader and hagwon instructor, then decided to try 'his own work' and started the business with his friend Yun Gi-hong. The item was seafood.\\n\\nBut once he jumped into the business, it was overwhelming not knowing what to start or where to begin. His daily routine was walking around Noryangjin Fish Market several times to get familiar with the atmosphere. That's when he noticed the fish market's characteristic 'black box operations.'\\n\\n\\\"There's a huge information gap between merchants and customers in fish markets. When people don't even properly know the types of fish, how many would know if the price of this fish is reasonable? Even if it's an overcharge, they have no choice but to buy it trusting only what the merchants say.\\\"\\n\\nAt the time, Noryangjin Fish Market was struggling with business due to excessive customer solicitation and overcharging that had completely driven away young consumers. He expected that if he ran around daily to verify and publish accurate market prices, it would benefit both consumers and merchants.\\n\\nThe beginning wasn't easy. Merchants looked at him like a scammer when he said he would promote their stores online if they gave him accurate market prices. Some merchants told him inflated prices above market rates. He couldn't overcome the merchants without studying. He traveled to fish markets and fish farms nationwide, building relationships with seafood industry professionals. He also consistently participated in dawn auctions to develop a sense for market prices.\\n\\nFor the first year, he promoted stores for free. Starting two years ago, merchants began voluntarily giving him compensation fees, saying \\\"Thanks to you, our sales increased 2-3 times,\\\" and it naturally became a paid service. Although there are over 10 more businesses in Noryangjin alone wanting partnerships, and expanding stores would increase profits, he said he has no plans to increase partner stores for the time being. This is because his employees check each store's prices and quality individually every morning, and he judged that hastily expanding could risk losing the trust of consumers and merchants.\\n\\nFor consumers not using Mermaid Cult Pirate Group, what should they watch out for when trying to buy good seafood at reasonable prices in fish markets?\\n\\n\\\"You should be wary of places that quote unusually low prices compared to other stores. There are still places that quote low prices then overcharge by adding 1-2kg through scale tricks. Don't buy what they show you by taking out of tanks claiming it's wild-caught. Wild-caught fish die quickly outside tanks, so merchants don't take them out of water to show customers. When they show you farmed fish gasping in baskets, you don't have to feel sorry and buy them reluctantly. Fish like mullet can survive for an hour even on bare ground.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3485, "output_tokens": 1086, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The plan is to select scholarship recipients in elementary school 6th grade and provide support so they can focus on their studies until university.\\n\\nWith approximately 30,000 students per grade level from households at or below 50% of median income (2.23 million won [approximately $1,670 USD] monthly for a family of four), the program will begin by supporting about 300 students, which is 1% of this population. The support amount will be up to 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] per month. This will cover supplementary materials, school supplies, dormitory fees, after-school program costs, and cultural activities. The plan is to select scholarship recipients through principal recommendations, comprehensively considering family circumstances, learning motivation and ability.\\n\\nThis is one of the comprehensive measures the government has introduced to reduce educational gaps as social polarization has widened the educational divide among students. The purpose is to ensure that low-income students can also be guaranteed quality educational opportunities.\\n\\nOn the 8th, the Ministry of Education announced 'Direction and Tasks for Educational Welfare Policy in Response to Economic and Social Polarization' at the Government Complex Seoul. This is the first time the government has established comprehensive policy direction in nine years since the 2008 'Comprehensive Educational Welfare Plan.'\\n\\nThe government has stepped forward because recent deepening socio-economic polarization has spread concepts like the 'spoon class theory'—where social and economic status is determined by family environment rather than ability—and such perceptions are being confirmed as fact. The average annual parental burden at private kindergartens in Seoul is 3.72 million won [approximately $2,790 USD], making it virtually difficult for low-income children to attend. Educational benefits provided to low-income elementary, middle, and high school students amount to little more than textbook and school supply costs, and the educational investment gap between households earning over 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] monthly and those earning less than 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] has widened to more than 10 times.\\n\\nEducational cost gaps lead to differences in advancing to higher-level schools, with university students from high-income families who don't need to apply for national scholarships being far more numerous at Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University, and other top institutions compared to the average. Even after entering university, low-income students find it difficult to focus on their studies due to tuition burdens.\\n\\nTo overcome this situation, the government has prepared support measures by age group and characteristics. To reduce the burden of early childhood education costs on low-income parents, it has decided to introduce 'public-type private kindergartens' with tuition lowered to the level of national and public kindergartens. The plan is to support private kindergartens to lower tuition while improving educational quality. To prevent the sharp increase in 'math dropouts' (students who give up on mathematics) after middle school, support for mathematics learning will also be strengthened by improving classroom instruction methods.\\n\\nAdditionally, integrated elementary-middle-high school models will be introduced in rural and fishing communities struggling with declining student numbers, and more budget will be allocated to provincial and municipal education offices and schools with many students from vulnerable groups.\\n\\nThe Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations [Korea's largest teachers' union] evaluated that 'there are many declarative parts, and specific measures for implementation and the budget to support them are insufficient.' Ahn Sang-jin, deputy director of Private Education Worry-Free World [a civic organization opposing excessive hagwon education], said, 'Even if support for public education is strengthened, in reality the effect will inevitably be halved due to the burden that hagwon education costs place on households, and measures are needed that target the fundamental causes of low-efficiency, high-intensity college entrance exam competition.'\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3037, "output_tokens": 946, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Since early this month, baking education for Chinese-Korean compatriots has been ongoing here for 6 weeks. On this day, students demanded hands-on practice where they could actually make bread. However, the instructor was reluctant to accept this.\\n\\nWhen Mr. A raised his voice asking \\\"When exactly will we do hands-on practice?\\\", Mr. B only replied \\\"I'll think about it (in that direction) soon.\\\" Mr. A, who said \\\"I've only watched bread-making videos for 3 weeks,\\\" confided that \\\"I don't need all this, it would be more comfortable to just check attendance well and receive a completion certificate.\\\" In the end, he spent time touching his smartphone in the practice room where baking videos were being screened.\\n\\nChinese-Korean compatriot Ms. C (27, female), who is receiving horticulture education at another technical academy, also said \\\"I haven't seen a single (practice) flower and have only been looking at flower photos that the instructor displays (on the beam projector) for 3 weeks.\\\"\\n\\nControversy is rising over the poor quality of the government's 'technical education program' targeting Chinese-Korean compatriots. This is a program where the Ministry of Justice issues work visas on the condition of technical education. Among overseas Chinese-Korean compatriots hoping to work in Korea, those who enter with short-term visit visas (C-3-8) and receive education in skills such as baking, horticulture, and beauty at domestic educational institutions can receive 3-year visit-employment (H-2) visas. However, at many technical education sites where over 60% of class time should involve hands-on practice, 'shoddy education' without practice is being conducted.\\n\\nApplicants must pay a separate tuition fee of 650,000 won [approximately $490 USD] and receive a total of 180 hours of education, 6 hours daily for 6 weeks. They cannot earn money until they receive work visas after education. Nevertheless, as a system that lowered the threshold for Chinese-Korean compatriots' entry into Korea, it has been implemented since 2010, and over 20,000 people out of approximately 250,000 who visit Korea annually come to receive technical education for work visa conversion. At the beginning of each month, technical education courses for around 20 Chinese-Korean compatriots are continuously organized at 175 educational institutions nationwide. A Ministry of Justice official said \\\"It's quite popular among Chinese-Korean compatriots as a means to realize the 'Korean Dream' through technical education.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, at sites inspected by Dong-A Ilbo reporters, proper technical education was not being conducted, contrary to the compatriots' hopes. At one educational institution, bank representatives even visited to recommend their company's check card enrollment to students, emphasizing 'special benefits.'\\n\\nThe 'Compatriot Education Operation Regulations' of the Compatriot Education Support Group, which arranges and manages educational institutions, only stipulates 'designated institutions must have an attendance rate of 90% or higher' as a completion condition. A support group official said \\\"In the dimension of encouraging (entry), completion certificates are generally issued if they attend faithfully without other exams.\\\" Although there is an unannounced inspection system at the support group level, it is difficult to monitor each small-scale course conducted across the country.\\n\\nAn administrative agent who handles visa issuance for Chinese-Korean compatriots pointed out that \\\"The current 'technical education program' is conducted completely separately from employment for Chinese-Korean compatriots, which lowers education quality and burdens initial adaptation,\\\" adding \\\"Realistic alternatives are needed to help them settle domestically, such as linking education with employment.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3212, "output_tokens": 1018, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

In 1905, when dark clouds hung over the nation's future, Bosung College, Korea University's predecessor, was born under the ideology of 'saving the nation through education.' Law and commerce, which no one paid attention to at the time, became the pillars. These two disciplines played important roles in laying the foundation of the nation and nurturing talent after liberation.\\n\\nUniversities must prepare for the future one step ahead like this. Korea University's founding ideology of saving the nation through education remains a valid value today. This is because the era we live in is a period of civilizational transformation stronger than any other time.\\n\\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is approaching, but every corner of our society is still steeped in outdated systems and concepts. The younger generation has lost vitality. The economy cannot escape stagnation. Our society appears to have fallen into confusion, having lost the ability to resolve accumulated contradictions.\\n\\nPresident Yeom Jae-ho\\n\\nKorea University holds the belief that 'when universities change, society and the nation can transform.' The vision for practicing change is 'pioneering intellect.' Korea University seeks to cultivate talent who knows how to wisely utilize rough waves to reach their destination. Students who are swept away by turbulent currents, losing direction and drifting, are not Korea University's ideal.\\n\\nTo achieve this, they first dismantled outdated systems embedded in education. In 2015, they introduced the 'Three No Policy' eliminating exam proctoring, attendance checking, and relative grading. The purpose was to not bind students to resume management and grade competition. Students are developing proactive attitudes that enable them to realize self-directed learning under the principles of autonomy, trust, and responsibility. President Yeom Jae-ho emphasized that 'Korea University students' competitors are not the classmates sitting next to them, but themselves.'\\n\\nKorea University abolished merit-based scholarships and expanded support for low-income students. Students facing financial difficulties secured time to focus on studies instead of part-time jobs through 'Justice Scholarships.' This is thanks to receiving additional monthly living expenses beyond tuition. The core of scholarship reform is that economic barriers should not become obstacles to learning.\\n\\nStudents boldly challenge the wider world through 'Truth Scholarships.' When students plan and propose programs they want to challenge or experience themselves, the scholarship committee provides scholarships after deliberation. The 'KU-Global Leadership Program' scholarship that allows students to go to China, Japan, Latin America, Northern Europe, etc., is a representative example. Students receive support for airfare, dormitory fees at schools in those countries, and tuition. President Yeom stated, 'Scholarships should be operated according to their original purpose of encouraging learning,' and 'Korea University's scholarship system reform is a message to society.'\\n\\nKorea University will abolish essay-writing exam admissions and expand comprehensive school record admissions starting from the 2018 academic year. This is an effort to reform society by properly establishing public education. Essay-writing exams have been identified as the main culprit in expanding the hagwon education market. If public education regains authority, excessive growth in the hagwon education market can be prevented. Accordingly, problems of household disposable income erosion and domestic economic recession can also be resolved. Korea University plans to directly select raw gems with potential rather than students trained in customized ways at entrance exam hagwons. To this end, they recently reorganized the admissions office into a talent discovery office.\\n\\nToday's Korea University is cultivating global intellects who will navigate the future. Just as Bosung College once lit a beacon to brighten the nation's future. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution arrives, the next 100 years will be completely different from the past 100 years. President Yeom emphasized, '21st-century talent must possess problem-solving abilities and problem-discovery abilities,' and 'such talent can never be cultivated through infinite competition and resume building.'\\n\\nKorea University has already bid farewell to outdated education. They are strengthening their resolve to solve social problems and discover future growth engines through new education.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3477, "output_tokens": 995, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Also selects businessman as administrative director\\nAttention focused on whether this will spread to other middle and high schools\\nPrincipal Kim Dong-chun (third from right), who is drawing attention as the first private school externally recruited principal, and Vice Principal Lee Jae-hong (fourth from right) are talking with students during break time. Reporter Ji Myeong-hun mhjee@donga.com\\nPrincipal Kim Dong-chun (53) of Daejeon Imun High School, a private school, was just about a month ago a regular teacher teaching history at Daeseong Girls' Middle School. Imun High School, which fell into crisis due to declining student numbers, brought him in as a relief pitcher unrelated to the foundation. This unprecedented external recruitment is the first in the private school sector in the Daejeon region. There is high interest inside and outside the education community as to whether this will become a catalyst for other private middle and high schools experiencing similar crises due to declining school-age population to bring in external personnel.\\n○ Daejeon's first unprecedented appointment of regular teacher as principal\\nImun Academy, which started as Haedong Academy in 1964, operates two schools under its umbrella: Imun High School and Sintanjin Middle School. It is well known that the late Lee Byeong-mu, who accumulated money through an ironware store at Daejeon Central Market, established the school to fulfill his regret of not having received an education.\\nHowever, recently student numbers have drastically decreased, creating a sense of crisis. In the case of Imun High School, student numbers dropped from 210 in 2014 to 164 this year, and the declining trend is expected to become even steeper in the future.\\nSince the school is located in Sintanjin on the outskirts of Daejeon, the decline in school-age population has been pronounced, and although it was belatedly incorporated into the equalization zone, it lacks competitiveness as there are no applications from the city center. Changes and innovation in the teaching community are also difficult to expect. This is due to the characteristics of private schools where teachers work in one place for 20-30 years without exchanges.\\nEarly this year, Board Chairman Lee Jae-kwang (53, photo) decided to find a solution through external recruitment of a principal. Having worked in the financial industry for over 30 years while operating the school and currently serving as an executive managing director at SK Securities, he determined that 'thinking outside the box' was necessary. Chairman Lee said, \\\"While schools aim for human education, the methods must be innovative like the service industry. To create 'a school students want to attend, parents want to send their children to, and teachers want to work at,' external recruitment was necessary.\\\"\\nFor private schools to exclude relatives from appointments to key school positions requires quite a significant decision. Around 2009, when student numbers had drastically declined, Chairman Lee said \\\"To change the school, the foundation must first give up authority and benefits,\\\" and hired an administrative director through public recruitment. The publicly recruited administrative director, who came from a business background, breathed vitality into the school through cafeteria and auditorium expansion and construction.\\n○ Interest in whether external recruitment will continue at private middle and high schools\\nChairman Lee held a school management planning meeting to explain the school's crisis and emphasize the necessity of external recruitment. This is because many school teachers dream of becoming principals through internal promotion. He then searched extensively to find three candidates and decided to recruit Principal Kim through board resolution. While external recruitment of principals at private schools is stipulated by law and there are precedents in other cities and provinces, this is the first time in Daejeon.\\nChairman Lee said, \\\"Although Principal Kim is a nationally known college entrance exam specialist, we expected him to fundamentally change the school because he equally possesses innovative and balanced work handling and educational philosophy.\\\" Principal Kim has served as co-representative of the National Academic Guidance Council, advisory committee member of Seoul National University's High School-University Liaison Council, and lead instructor for EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] college admission information sessions.\\nWhile those around expected entrance exam-focused changes when Principal Kim took office, different changes are actually occurring.

There's no need for lengthy detailed explanations. It's because people perceive it as roughly the root of evil that causes exam fever and destroys public education. When you see news about parents' backs breaking under the money they pour into hagwons and children having to grab meals at convenience stores late at night, this country's hagwon education problem seems like a mutant zombie virus impervious to any prescription.\\n\\nWith this kind of national anger, campaign promises emerge to abolish hagwon education through a national referendum, and news reports continue in the vein of 'this is why hagwon education is problematic' without presenting concrete alternatives. Looking at the campaign promises of several presidential candidates and articles harshly criticizing hagwon education, one might think the hagwon education market will collapse within days. I asked an executive from a hagwon education company for their opinion.\\n\\n'That's just talk - nothing will change, so there's no need to protest. If the goal is to normalize public education, schools should just teach well. But why do they only bash hagwon education as the problem?'\\n\\nWhile this is certainly logic armed with self-interest, I think we need to consider why the path to public education normalization is sought through bashing hagwon education. If you grabbed parents and asked 'Between schools and hagwons, which takes responsibility for your children's studies?', what results would emerge? Ignoring this reality and focusing solely on bashing hagwon education - can good prescriptions come from this approach? Instead of thinking about restraining hagwons from advance learning, why don't we devise and apply excellent learning methods so that students who properly go through the process of sequential, step-by-step learning and mastery receive high evaluations?\\n\\nHagwon instructors must teach well to be chosen by students and parents. Otherwise, they're kicked out after classes are cancelled overnight. So they teach in ways that are easy for students to understand, pinpointing exactly what's needed. Though they go through ruthless evaluation, they're given the clear carrot of hefty compensation, so hagwons truly operate efficiently.\\n\\nWhat about schools? Try to select teachers who teach well, and they're likely to collectively rebel, saying it 'brings the bloody winds of competition to public education.' I've even seen a teacher who responded with head-shaving to a high school principal's proposal to move up arrival and dismissal times by 20 minutes each to spend the day more efficiently. The atmosphere is such that excellent students apply to education universities, pass the teacher employment exam after fierce competition, gain the glorious title of educator, and then don't need to make any effort whatsoever. If schools taught better than hagwons and, based on that confidence, gave students appropriate amounts of homework to complete individually or in groups, there would be nowhere to go even if you pushed them toward hagwons.\\n\\nCan public education be revived by ignoring the most urgent need to improve teacher quality and only hammering hagwons? As long as such misguided prescriptions continue, there's no way to prevent the qualitative decline of school education, and the screams of parents and students in the thriving hagwon education market will never cease. Hagwon education that uses shallow commercial tactics to stoke overheating by deceiving people that they must learn 10 books when learning just one would suffice, or hagwon education that instills fear in parents to make them fall into habitual addiction, must definitely be excised. These problems with hagwons can be precisely excised by applying the appropriate scalpel. That would be good, but closing hagwons doesn't automatically make schools better.\\n\\nAre teachers beings who shouldn't compete? Without introducing measures to evaluate what efforts they've made to teach children well and dismiss those who fall short of standards, there is no future for this country's public education. It's time to stop the prescription of avoiding the clear infected area out of fear of backlash and applying the scalpel to the wrong places.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3390, "output_tokens": 962, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

I'm a parent with a high school freshman child. I'm worried because my child hasn't decided on a career path yet. How should I help them find their career direction?\\n\\nA. The importance of career choice is growing, but it's not an easy task. It requires a process of looking inward at oneself. Others cannot teach you what you should do. They can provide information, but the choice belongs to the student.\\n\\nThere are two main reasons why students feel difficulty in choosing a career path. One is not knowing what they want to do, and the other is not knowing well what kinds of jobs exist.\\n\\nIf the reason is the latter, the solution is simple. Information about careers and academic majors can be easily obtained through internet searches or books. You can check what jobs exist in fields that interest you, what majors you need to study, what the work environment is like, and what the future prospects are.\\n\\nHowever, if the reason for not being able to make a career choice is the former, it cannot be resolved simply. If your child says things like 'I don't have anything I want to do' or 'This is no good for this reason, that's no good for that reason,' then this applies to them.\\n\\nIn this case, students must explore their areas of interest themselves. They should refer to aptitude tests conducted at school and actively reflect on themselves. Think about what fields you look at with interest in newspapers, on the internet, or in bookstores. Also, if you answer questions yourself about which subjects or units you like in school classes, what you enjoy among hagwon or after-school activities, what was fun among school events, and whether there are fields you find yourself talking a lot about to others without realizing it, you will be able to see your areas of interest to some extent.\\n\\nOnce you've found your areas of interest to some degree, now you need to think about what you're good at. The era of simply saying you're good at studying or arts and physical education is over. Since everyone has different dispositions, everyone has their own strengths, and the key is whether you discover them or not.\\n\\nParents' observational skills from watching their children regularly are also a great help. Look back and see if you've ever talked to others about your child, saying things like 'My child speaks well and has a talent for persuading others,' 'They're good at assembling and making things,' or 'They're good at counseling friends' problems.' If not, even now, observe your child closely and think about your child's potential.\\n\\nThe career path in the first year of high school doesn't need to be an accurate choice down to a specific major or job. It's okay if it's comprehensive. It's enough if it can serve as a criterion for judgment at important moments of choice that must be made after entering high school, such as academic tracks and clubs. It's also good to steadily explore careers in areas of interest while spending your high school years and gradually make them more concrete with what suits you.\\n\\nThere is no correct answer in career choice. What's important is that it should be a career choice that comes from serious consideration about yourself, not an impulsive decision. For this, we must not forget that above all, a process of getting to know yourself through various experiences is necessary.\\n\\nJinhak-sa Youth Education Research Institute\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3096, "output_tokens": 825, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Previous figures who ran for president or served as president also called for educational reform but failed to achieve it properly. This was because they took only superficial approaches trying to solve everything through university admissions policies alone. Fundamental deliberation is needed.\\n\\nUnfortunately, dichotomous thinking still exists in our country regarding exercise and studying. People think that athletes should only exercise and regular students should only study. While perceptions have been changing recently, many people remain insensitive to the obvious truth that athletes should also study and regular students should also exercise. This is the background behind the continued mass production of 'exercise machines' as well as students who wander aimlessly through the hagwon districts.\\n\\nScientific findings showing that exercise and studying cannot be separated have been emerging for a long time. The American weekly magazine 'Newsweek' published a cover story titled 'Stronger, Faster, Smarter' in its March 26, 2007 issue, which drew attention. Based on a book called 'Spark' written by Harvard Medical School Professor John Ratey, it introduced various research results showing that exercise makes you smarter. Spark was filled with findings that exercise causes muscles to produce BDNF (Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor), a neurotrophin derived from the brain. Professor Ratey argued that 'you need to exercise to become smarter and for your brain to overcome various stresses.' The saying 'A sound Mind in a Sound Body,' which has come down from Greek and Roman times, didn't emerge for nothing.\\n\\nEducational programs reflecting these scientific results are being implemented in some places domestically. 'Zero-period PE classes' are representative. Students do physical education first upon arriving at school and then begin classes. This is a program created based on the findings that exercise makes you smarter. There are also efforts to help students' healthy growth by having them participate in various sports clubs after school. Compared to the past, the number of students enjoying sports activities has greatly increased. However, schools are divided between those that implement these programs and those that don't, by school and by region. Particularly in the case of high schools facing college entrance exams, participation rates drop sharply. Some schools participate reluctantly because it's linked to school evaluations that provide funding. Experts point out that a system where all schools participate is needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, America's prestigious private schools emphasize sports. Harvard University, which claims to cultivate global leaders, evaluates four areas when selecting new students: academic performance, extracurricular activities, character and personality, and athletic ability. They give particularly high scores to students who were active as athletes in middle and high school and served as team captains. This is based on the judgment that they acquired the basics needed as leaders through sports. 'Ivy League' universities like Yale and Columbia are the same. The common recognition of these schools is that leadership, cooperation, sincerity, sociability, and perseverance can be gained through sports. This also means that leaders should at least possess such basic character traits.\\n\\nIn Korea, students who study are considered successful if they're good at the so-called 'Guk-Yeong-Su [Korean, English, Math].' Research results are emerging that attribute the recent decline in creative and leadership-oriented talent to our backward education system that ranks students based solely on grades in specific subjects. An education system where students can enjoy various sports from a young age while also studying, like in advanced countries—would this be a distant dream in our country? I place my hopes on the next president.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3240, "output_tokens": 851, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Photo provided by Jung Woo-seong\\n\\nJung Woo-seong, Chungju High School 2nd year\\n\\nUp until now, Korean Geography had been a boring subject. It felt like a memorization subject where you look at maps and memorize regional characteristics. Last year's Korean Geography classes at Chungju High School were different. They were conducted not as rote memorization classes, but as vivid experience-centered classes.\\n\\nLast May, we were learning the 'Topographical Environment and Ecosystem' unit from the Korean Geography textbook. We directly visited Dokdo and Ulleungdo to see firsthand the coastal landform 'doline' of Ulleungdo and explored the corresponding ecosystem. Seeing with our own eyes the doline - a funnel-shaped concave depression formed when calcium carbonate, the main component of limestone, dissolves - made us understand it immediately without having to memorize it. The refreshing energy conveyed by the cool sea breeze was a bonus.\\n\\nLast November, we conducted geological exploration education (GEO edu) in the Danyang region of North Chungcheong Province. After learning about structures such as folds, faults, and unconformities observed in Danyang, we directly observed the topography. We also studied fossils together, including cephalopods, corals, and graptolites. Then in December, we visited Hyundai Steel's plant in Dangjin, South Chungcheong Province, a product of Korean steel industry, which enhanced our understanding of the 'Diverse Korean Territory' unit. By directly exploring the regional characteristics we learned about in class, it seemed like repetitive learning happened naturally without having to memorize.\\n\\nAlong with 'outside the classroom' geography classes, 'inside the classroom' project classes also take place. Rather than teachers unilaterally delivering knowledge, it's a method where students create lesson plans and conduct classes themselves. Taking the 'Diverse Korean Territory' unit as an example, we divide into teams and each team member creates PowerPoint presentations, worksheets, and even handmade productions (UCC) to take charge of conducting classes. By becoming teachers and conducting classes, and having discussions with friends, it feels like the textbook becomes imprinted in our minds like a photograph.\\n\\nThe greatest gain from this 'class transformation' experiment in Korean Geography is that students have developed a more active attitude toward learning. Through such experiments that change theory-centered social education into communication-centered learning, Chungju High School was designated as a social studies-focused school starting this year.\\n\\nJung Woo-seong, Chungju High School 2nd year\\n\\n※Please share vivid voices from educational settings.

The results showed that 8.9% of respondents said they sent their children to language-related hagwons for English, Korean, etc. An official from the metropolitan office of education said, \\\"Even among these, the vast majority were Korean hagwons, so the percentage sending children to English hagwons was extremely small.\\\" Looking at the numbers alone, there was virtually no phenomenon of flocking to hagwons due to the English class ban.\\n\\nHowever, when examining Sejong City's characteristics one by one, many point out that it's unreasonable for the government to cite Sejong City as evidence that there is no 'balloon effect.' Sejong City is a new city where the relocation of government offices was completed in 2014. In 2016, when the metropolitan office of education conducted the survey, there were only 3 'English kindergartens'—English hagwons targeting young children—let alone a developed hagwon district. This increased to 5 locations last year, but this is woefully inadequate compared to Seoul (161 locations) and Gyeonggi [Province] (110 locations). In terms of English hagwons per kindergarten student, Sejong has 0.0009, which is half of Seoul's 0.0018. In essence, even if parents wanted to send their children to English hagwons, there aren't many suitable hagwons available.\\n\\nIt's also noteworthy that the majority of kindergartens in Sejong City are public kindergartens. To compete with national and public kindergartens preferred by parents, private kindergartens actively implement English classes. For this reason, they strongly oppose the English class ban policy. Among Sejong City's 53 kindergartens, only 3 are private. The government's English class ban policy could take hold without significant resistance. In contrast, 1 out of every 2 kindergartens nationwide (47.4%) is private, and in Seoul particularly, this reaches 76.3%.\\n\\nThe special characteristics of Sejong City, where many central government civil servants live, also need to be considered. Central government civil servants, who have more opportunities for overseas training and work assignments compared to other occupational groups, have less need to rely on hagwon education even when their children don't have English classes in kindergarten. Civil servant A from a central government ministry, who recently returned with an elementary school child after completing a year-long training program in the United States, said, \\\"I didn't provide separate hagwon education, but now [my child] can read books in English and is fluent in conversation.\\\"\\n\\nMoreover, even when kindergarten English classes are banned, there are many cases where children are given English workbooks to solve or parents directly teach English, even if they don't send them to hagwons. Ko Ho-jeong (36, female), a full-time housewife who moved from Daejeon to Sejong last year, has her 5-year-old daughter work on English workbooks and shows her English education-related videos. Ko said, \\\"Unlike the previous daycare center, the kindergarten [my daughter] currently attends doesn't have English classes, so I'm providing English education this way in hopes that my child will be exposed to English even a little earlier,\\\" adding \\\"I'm considering sending her to an English hagwon this year.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3036, "output_tokens": 990, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

According to admission principles, absence from interviews results in automatic failure.\\n\\nHowever, Professor Lee (50), who served as both interview committee chair and head of the Postmodern Music Department, demanded \\\"Pass Jung.\\\" Professor Lee even wrote Jung's 'score' on a memo and handed it over. This occurred during the public uproar over Choi Soon-sil's daughter Jung Yu-ra's preferential admission to Ewha Womans University. Professor A responded, \\\"The country is in this state because of Jung Yu-ra... I can't do that,\\\" and gave a '0 score.' Jung failed.\\n\\n○ \\\"Possibility of graduate school admission to delay military enlistment\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Lee's 'Jung Yong-hwa admission project' did not stop.

He was the top scorer among 8 applicants.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Intellectual Crime Investigation Unit, which has been investigating Jung's fraudulent admission charges since June last year, confirmed these facts and announced them on the 2nd. The investigation revealed that Jung received his enlistment notice in September 2016, about a month before his first interview. Earlier, in August of that year, Jung had sent an application to the Military Manpower Administration stating \\\"I want to postpone enlistment for graduate school enrollment.\\\" Circumstances also emerged showing he had met with Professor Lee a month earlier to discuss graduate school admission.\\n\\nPolice stated, \\\"It appears highly likely that Jung used graduate school admission to delay military enlistment\\\" and \\\"We judge that he probably had some expectation of graduate school acceptance.\\\"\\n\\nJung testified during police investigation, \\\"It was not to delay military enlistment. It was for academic purposes.\\\" However, Jung reportedly could not provide a convincing answer to the question \\\"If it was for study purposes, why did you skip interviews twice?\\\" Jung is known to have rarely attended classes even after admission.\\n\\nDuring the investigation, Jung and Professor Lee made contradictory claims. Jung claimed, \\\"Professor Lee first proposed doctoral program admission.\\\" Professor Lee countered, \\\"Jung's side first requested admission.\\\" When police requested polygraph tests, both refused.

The problem is that there's no system within the school to monitor admission processes.\\\"\\n\\nThis investigation also revealed that singer Jo Gyu-man (49) fraudulently gained admission to the same graduate school's master's program after passing despite missing his interview. Singer Jo Kwon (30), who faced suspicions of not meeting graduation requirements, was excluded from investigation due to unclear evidence of wrongdoing. Police referred 6 related individuals including Jung, Jo, and Professor Lee to the prosecution with recommendations for indictment that day.

In the distant past, learning to read through the Thousand Character Classic and skillfully reciting the Four Books and Three Classics was considered an excellent learning method, and since the enlightenment period, foreign school education methods have been introduced and continue to this day. School education has also gradually changed from the past. Unlike the past when teachers' classes were absolute, students can now study through EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) or online lectures, and Meister high schools that cultivate technical masters have emerged rather than studying solely for the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam).\\n\\nIn fact, institutional education is a rational means of bringing nearly all students up to a certain level. However, this educational method doesn't suit all students. For this reason, some families with purposeful parents and teachers gather to establish alternative schools or choose 'homeschooling' where they teach at home.\\n\\n'Homeschool Daddy,' a solo content creator, introduces his daily life of teaching his three sons with homeschooling as his theme. Why did he, who received institutional education and even worked at a major domestic corporation, choose homeschooling and promote it to many people?\\n\\nHomeschool Daddy YouTube Channel (Source=IT Donga)\\n\\n\\\"My eldest son said he didn't want to go to school when he was in 4th grade. He had good concentration on one subject, but couldn't adapt well to socializing with friends or an environment where subjects changed according to set times. Actually, thinking about my own school days, I couldn't understand it. We tried counseling and went to hospitals for a year, but everyone thought it wasn't a big problem. So we sent the child back to school and he seemed to adapt well. But this time my wife thought the child wasn't enjoying school now but enduring it. Because of this, we started homeschooling to find an educational method that suited the child, and now all three children are studying this way.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, he's not unconditionally opposed to institutional education. He thinks that schools and teachers are also working hard, and it's fine if children can adapt well to school. However, he said he wants to let people know that there are other methods because not all students can adapt well.\\n\\nProfessor Kim Yong-seong, active as Homeschool Daddy (Source=IT Donga)\\n\\nCreating content related to alternative education through YouTube and showing it to many people is also for the same reason. The content he creates is not educational materials for homeschooling, but content that shows the positive aspects while displaying the daily life of homeschooling.\\n\\n\\\"When I chose homeschooling, there were many people around me who were curious. The most common question was what we do at home if we don't send them to school. So I felt that content explaining these things was necessary. Initially, I made content focused on explaining homeschooling, but now I'm avoiding this. YouTube is not a place where someone teaches others, and such content ultimately becomes repeating what existing schools were doing. So now I'm making content showing children homeschooling or children playing.\\\"\\n\\nHe said that thinking homeschooling is a foreign culture is a prejudice. Korea has traditionally been based on teaching at home. A representative example is seodang [traditional village school] culture, where children gathered at the homes of elders or intellectuals in the village to learn writing and character. Today's homeschooling also forms a kind of community where various parents take charge of different subjects to teach children together.\\n\\nConducting 'Sandwich Coding' to learn coding principles through homeschooling (Source=Homeschool Daddy YouTube Channel)\\n\\n\\\"Public education in today's form has only been introduced for about 200 years. Europe adopted this public education as an efficient method for 'mass-producing obedient factory workers,' and this method continued even to Nazi Germany. But Europe came to know that this educational method was not right and is changing its educational approach.\\\"\\n\\nRecently, he's also making content related to coding, and his second child has started studying coding. His role here is to show the direction of study and provide motivation, while the child studies on their own. In the case of coding, since many free classrooms operated by local governments have recently emerged, the child is studying alone through these.\\n\\n\\\"What's regrettable is that today's coding education is focused only on teaching development languages and code. Actually, what's important in development is not writing code but the algorithm of imagining how it will work. To compare it to video editing, code corresponds to video tools like Premiere Pro, and algorithms correspond to content planning. Actually, my second child made code for specific operations well, but it didn't lead to developing programs where such codes work organically together. So I'm showing this study direction.\\\"\\n\\nHomeschool Daddy (Source=IT Donga)\\n\\nCurrently, coding education in the United States is not teaching code but teaching algorithms. This is called 'unplugged coding,' where they teach logical structures corresponding to algorithms through things like board games. He said, \\\"You should learn principles and then learn technology. But today's coding education is teaching centered on technology rather than principles. If you only learn technology, you might become an employee of a partner company rather than 'Mark Zuckerberg.'\\\"\\n\\nSince homeschooling is different from public education, its advantages and disadvantages are also divided. For example, homeschooling makes it difficult to learn detailed parts of specific subjects. It's like being able to read English fluently but not receiving very high scores on the TOEIC test. However, studying on one's own about fields they like has very fast growth speed. They're weak at tests, but their ability to study doesn't fall behind.\\n\\nWhat Homeschool Daddy was concerned about was the part related to character education. While general study is possible through online lectures or textbooks, he worried about how to provide practice related to social life. But after actually doing it, his position is that the sociability of children who did homeschooling might be better.\\n\\n\\\"When you go to school, you get along well with friends of the same grade, but there's less exchange with seniors/juniors who are only one year apart than you think. In contrast, homeschooling allows you to get along well with people who are five years apart and also do homeschooling together, and you don't feel uncomfortable meeting adults. I think social life means getting along well with people who are not family and not peers.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, public education is cheaper in terms of cost. Moreover, many schools even provide meals. However, it's common to send children to hagwons after school ends. Considering hagwon education costs, the cost of homeschooling is not that expensive either.\\n\\nHomeschool Daddy (Source=IT Donga)\\n\\n\\\"Homeschooling is difficult for dual-income couples. It's like neglecting the children. For the same reason, it's also difficult for families with only one child. There's one message I want to convey through Homeschool Daddy content. Fathers should return home. Many mothers are already devoted to their children's education, but fathers are too busy. TV programs feature variety shows where fathers and children appear together, but reality is far from this. Rather than such grand things, I want to propose starting with small things like reading books with children on weekends.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lastly, what I want to say is to start homeschooling when the father has confidence. It's too hard for the mother to do alone. I think the most important thing a father can do as a father is to protect the family and raise the children well.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5437, "output_tokens": 1774, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The total education cost per child for households with monthly average income of 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD] or more was 144.84 million won [approximately $109,300 USD], three times that of households earning less than 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD] (47.66 million won [approximately $36,000 USD]).\\n\\nChild education costs also varied by region. Seoul residents (107.02 million won [approximately $80,800 USD]) spent 1.5 times more on child education than those in rural areas excluding the metropolitan area and major cities (71.10 million won [approximately $53,600 USD]). Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] three districts spent 125.18 million won [approximately $94,500 USD] on education. Among residents of this area, 15% answered that they had 'experience moving because of school districts,' and 21% said they had registered for famous lectures or received admissions consulting.\\n\\n○ Young people spend average of 4.68 million won [approximately $3,500 USD] on employment\\n\\nEmployment was also found to require considerable costs. According to the report, job seekers spent an average of 4.68 million won [approximately $3,500 USD] over 1.4 years, excluding housing and living costs. Sixty percent of them worked part-time jobs to cover these employment costs. 2.7% even took out loans.\\n\\nNew graduates who successfully found employment within the past three years took an average of 1.1 years and spent 3.84 million won [approximately $2,900 USD] to find jobs. Current job seekers are spending both more time and money on job preparation than recently hired new graduates. By occupation, civil servants spent the most money finding employment at 6.33 million won [approximately $4,800 USD] (1.6-year preparation period). This is interpreted as spending on textbooks and hagwon fees. Professional occupations followed at 4.80 million won [approximately $3,600 USD] (1.2-year preparation period), and education positions at 4.29 million won [approximately $3,200 USD] (1.8-year preparation period).\\n\\n○ Average retirement at age 56\\n\\nRetirees aged 50 and above retired at an average age of 56. This was about three years earlier than their expected age of 59.\\n\\nWhile 62% of retirees had planned their desired retirement timing in advance, only 24% actually retired at their planned time. Thirty-eight percent of retirees faced retirement with no planning at all.\\n\\nRetirees' average monthly household income was 3.81 million won [approximately $2,900 USD], a decrease of 1.44 million won [approximately $1,100 USD] from before retirement (5.25 million won [approximately $4,000 USD]). Post-retirement income consisted of 50% pension income and 22% financial income such as interest and asset income from real estate.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3282, "output_tokens": 1265, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Concerns it may devolve into meaningless study devoid of fun\\nJung Se-jin, Editorial Board Member\\nSouth Korea possesses world-class information technology (IT) hardware (HW) manufacturing capabilities. Its telecommunications infrastructure is so solid that it was the first country in the world to implement 5th generation (5G) networks. However, it is notably weak in the software (SW) field. Even Samsung Electronics, which has the best professional workforce in the country, criticized itself, saying \\\"Instagram [a photo-sharing app] was developed by 4 people in 6 weeks. If Samsung had developed it, it would have taken hundreds of people a year.\\\"\\n\\nThese days, coding hagwons that teach computer languages to create SW are noticeably increasing in Seoul's Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] and Mok-dong areas. My mistaken belief that growing interest in the SW industry would lead to us creating innovative services like Instagram was quickly shattered. Starting with middle school students this year, and with elementary 5th and 6th graders next year, coding education will be included as a regular subject, and with the atmosphere suggesting that special admissions categories for SW fields in university entrance will expand, hagwons have sprung up accordingly. The original purpose of developing thinking and creativity skills has disappeared entirely, with only the hagwon industry's noisy 'anxiety marketing' claiming that 'SW education is necessary for college admission.' Some are even saying that the major subjects determining university admissions have become 'Korean-English-Math-Coding,' adding coding to the existing 'Korean-English-Math.'\\n\\nKorea's industrial development process differs from Western advanced countries. The general evolution process of Western industry involved consumer desires and producer creativity manifesting as various products and technologies through trial and error (Process A), mainstream products emerging through market selection (Process B), and popularization through long-term improvements in technology and price competitiveness (Process C).\\n\\nKorea skipped Process A and started directly from Process B, imitating advanced country products determined by the state or corporations. What was needed was technology for imitation. There was no need to understand the context of product and technology creation. This was the 'fast follower' strategy of succeeding by making things quickly and cheaply to sell. Korea's major industries—semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding, and steel—all went through this process.\\n\\nHowever, Korea became caught in a 'sandwich situation' between China, another fast follower, and advanced countries. By skipping the stage of drawing blueprints through long-term trial and error with challenging tasks and having them selected (Process A), Korea failed to accumulate 'time for accumulation' and ultimately failed to develop the capacity to produce innovative products.\\n\\nI'm concerned that Korea's recent coding education fever will also skip Process A and merely focus on acquiring technology for Process B. When our children are twelve years old—the age when they receive computer education at hagwons for university admissions—Microsoft (MS) founder Bill Gates was frequenting his school's computer room. The teacher who taught him how to operate it said, \\\"The first day was the only day I knew more about computers than Bill,\\\" showing how Gates immersed himself on his own. Apple founder Steve Jobs, in his teens, would sneak into Stanford University's library with his friend Steve Wozniak to steal looks at technical magazines in order to create and sell devices that could make long-distance calls for free.\\n\\nThe coding our children are learning now could be replaced by a single mouse click due to rapid technological advancement. What's ultimately needed is not specific technology. It's an educational environment that nurtures children's will and interest to discover and solve problems, and allows them to pick up coding as a problem-solving tool from their surroundings at any time. If Korean education, which created 'math dropouts' [students who give up on mathematics], once again turns coding into just another boring exam subject and produces even 'coding dropouts,' our future becomes truly bleak.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3337, "output_tokens": 961, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Participants began with ice breaking by expressing their current situations through image cards, then in Part 1 had opportunities to understand their own and others' characteristics and differences through lectures on personality types and group activities. In Part 2, time was provided to understand each other's positional differences and learn effective communication by dividing and performing teacher and child roles. In the final Part 3, participants presented their motivations for becoming childcare teachers and the preparations needed in that process.

Another core competitive advantage is the differentiated curricula of the Future School established in 2018 and the Graduate School of Convergence and Information established in 2013.\\n\\nThe Future School pursues convergence and interdisciplinary education encompassing humanities, social sciences, and engineering to cultivate talent specialized for the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. As a place that nurtures talent with flexible thinking, the curriculum is also operated flexibly. By breaking down barriers between majors, students can choose one of three majors: Big Data, New Industry Technology Management, or International Cooperation and Multiculturalism. Students can also choose to study all three. In the first semester 2018 admissions, students active in various professions including university professors, general hospital doctors, corporate executives, and corporate information officers applied to the Future School in large numbers, recording high competition rates.\\n\\nThe Big Data major was created to nurture professional personnel who analyze phenomena and establish strategies based on big data, which can be called the language of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Big data analysis job functions linked to NCS (National Competency Standards) are also reflected in the curriculum.\\n\\nThe New Industry Technology Management major cultivates experts who create added value by generating new industries through convergence between technologies or integration of information and communication technology with traditional industries. The curriculum is organically designed so that students can acquire specialized knowledge such as 'information and communication technology' and 'general management theory' after learning general knowledge about changes in future society.\\n\\nFinally, the International Cooperation and Multiculturalism major aims to nurture personnel who help immigrants settle into Korean society and contribute to developing human rights and welfare services in third world countries. In addition to solid academic education, it provides field training education in immigration and multiculturalism. Courses are also prepared for obtaining ODA [Official Development Assistance] expert certification supervised by KOICA [Korea International Cooperation Agency] and multicultural society expert level 2 completion certificates.\\n\\nThe Graduate School of Convergence and Information, established in 2013, cultivates data experts for the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.

Half of all graduates (742 students) entered prestigious American universities. Raffles is the school with the best Ivy League admission record in the world, excluding the United States. This fact was recently reported in the Wall Street Journal, making this school a topic of conversation even in America. What's the secret? We visited Raffles last week. They said it was the first time for a Korean journalist.\\n\\nWu Youying (17), whom we met there, dreams of entering Stanford University.

His goal is to score over 1,550 points on the SAT (American college entrance exam) next month. Raffles has five college admission specialists. They provide college guidance to students, divided by country including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.\\n\\nHowever, what makes Raffles special lies elsewhere. Although it's Singapore's top school, it only charges 28 Singapore dollars [approximately $21 USD] per month in tuition. This is thanks to the government's full support based on the policy of 'providing the best education if you have talent.' That's not all. If students who enter overseas prestigious universities desire it, the government provides full scholarship support of tens of millions of won [approximately $15,000–75,000 USD] annually in tuition fees.\\n\\nIn return, after completing their studies, they must return to Singapore and work for the government or government-affiliated companies for at least six years.

Approximately 2,500 parents flocked to the event, making the memorial hall interior and even the corridors so crowded there was no room to step.\\n\\nLee Sun-i (40, Yeonsu-dong, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon), who has a third-grade elementary school son, said, \\\"These days, even with school records [GPA] of grade 1 or 2, it's difficult to get into mid-tier universities in Seoul,\\\" adding, \\\"In that case, I think it would be better to prepare early and send him to a special-purpose high school.\\\"\\n\\nMyongji Foreign Language High School Vice Principal Jang In-seong explained, \\\"Many parents show interest despite changes in the college entrance system because the level of teachers and academic atmosphere at special-purpose high schools are significantly superior.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, there were many cases of hesitation about advancing to special-purpose high schools because school records [GPA] will carry greater weight starting from the 2008 academic year college admissions.\\n\\nKang Eun-ji (15), a third-year student at Sindorim Middle School in Seoul who even left school early to attend the information session, said, \\\"I think if I advance to a special-purpose high school, I'll be able to focus solely on studying,\\\" but added, \\\"I'm worried because I hear school records [GPA] are disadvantageous there.\\\"\\n\\nBaek In-kyung (43, Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, Gyeonggi), who has a third-year middle school son, said, \\\"The quality of education is much higher than regular high schools, but I haven't been able to make a decision because of the disadvantageous school records [GPA],\\\" adding, \\\"I'm also considering having him advance to overseas universities after entering a special-purpose high school.\\\"\\n\\nLim Seong-ho, Planning Director at Haneul Education, said, \\\"About 1,000 parents attended each year, but this year more parents attended than expected,\\\" adding, \\\"While it's true that interest in special-purpose high schools is high, whether this enthusiasm will lead to high competition rates remains uncertain.\\\"\\n\\nLim Hyun-seop, Director of Sangsan High School's Admissions Management Office, emphasized, \\\"While many parents are concerned about school records [GPA], it hasn't been decided how universities will accept the current government's college admission plans,\\\" adding, \\\"In the 2008 academic year admissions system, in-depth and oral interviews will be important, so special-purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools will still be advantageous.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Gil Jin-gyun leon@donga.com\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2902, "output_tokens": 1075, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It was an event where a Baekje specialist from Korea was invited to share the latest research findings. Since it was hosted by a university, I assumed the audience would consist of young university students and graduate students. When I actually went to the lecture hall, I was surprised not only by the unexpectedly large audience of over 100 people, but also by the diverse demographics of men and women of all ages. Listening to the questions posed to the speaker at the end of the lecture, I learned that the occupations were varied—self-employed business owners, housewives, office workers, and others. What struck me most was their high level of curiosity about another country's history.\\n\\nPresident Roh Moo-hyun reportedly ordered his cabinet members to study history, saying \\\"the situation we face is similar to that of 100 years ago.\\\" Amid the controversy over historical distortion, voices calling for strengthened national history education are growing louder. The word 'history' will likely appear regularly in various current issues going forward, including the settlement of past affairs and conflicts between conservatives and progressives.\\n\\n▼Can extending national history class hours solve the problem?▼\\n\\nWe tend to be indifferent to history. While it would be normal for historical knowledge to improve as one progresses from high school students to university students to the general public, there are survey results showing that historical knowledge actually decreases as one moves up these levels. Even if discourse about history overflows, if the majority of citizens don't know history, we cannot obtain the right answers from history. History can potentially transform into a weapon that divides society and harms others.\\n\\nThe question is where the reason for not knowing history lies. There are indeed problems with history education. However, designating national history as a mandatory subject on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) to make students study more history will not solve the problem.\\n\\nWhen news broke that national history education would be strengthened, many negative opinions appeared on the internet. These were mainly reactions from teenagers who would face increased academic burden. Comments like 'Even if we designate national history as a mandatory subject, it will end up as rote memorization anyway, so what improvement is there over the current situation?' and 'The current two hours per week of classes aren't too few. Making the classes more interesting is more important.' Though these seem like spontaneous opinions, they contain the right answer.\\n\\nNational history has long been a representative memorization subject. There are countless miscellaneous things to memorize. After taking the test and turning away, that's the end of it. Expanding such classes would only increase resistance. There are many worrying aspects as well. The leftist bias in modern and contemporary history textbooks is serious. 'Strengthening national history education' could lead to 'strengthening ideological education.' It shouldn't become a platform for school teachers to preach their own historical views either.\\n\\nAlong with national history, one must also know world history to avoid falling into the trap of exclusive nationalism. To counter historical distortion with logic, one must know Chinese and Japanese history. Most essential is cultivating the thinking ability to judge history.\\n\\nOriginally, there are few fields as fascinating as history. All stories are based on history in some way, and history programs on TV are popular in every country. It's absurd how indifference to history has expanded and we've become unaware that others are stealing our history.\\n\\nIt cannot be said to be only the fault of history teachers. Entrance exam education focused on scores has blocked interest in history. Like the climate that neglects the humanities, society as a whole has failed to make history an object of curiosity. For instance, one role of public broadcasting is to produce easy-to-understand and interesting history programs that foster public interest in history. KBS's 'History Special,' which was quite popular, was quietly replaced by a 'Code' program. This is always how public broadcasting operates.\\n\\n▼To become immersed in history▼\\n\\nIf there's any gain from the historical distortion controversy, it's that we've realized that interest in history is directly connected to our lives. When will the day come when we too become a 'curiosity paradise' for history, where audiences flock to history lectures?\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3372, "output_tokens": 1011, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Among them, 4 are current students. The story of Kim Ji-myeong, a 3rd-year student at Sundeok High School in Dobong-gu, Seoul, is moving netizens.\\nKim, a science track student, received perfect scores on Korean, English, Math, Korean History, Chemistry I, and Biology II on this year's CSAT. According to a Chosun Ilbo report on the 5th, Kim said he studied alone using online lectures. The only hagwon experience he had was attending English and math hagwons for one year during elementary school.\\nHowever, the path to achieving a perfect CSAT score was not smooth. Kim was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 6th grade of elementary school. He fought the disease while receiving chemotherapy treatment throughout his three years of middle school. He entered Sundeok High School, a special purpose high school, while undergoing treatment, and received a complete recovery diagnosis in March of his first year of high school.\\nThe person he was most grateful to while preparing for the CSAT was his 'mom.' Kim's mother, a native of Insu-dong in Gangbuk-gu, has been running a loach soup restaurant for over 10 years, just 10 minutes away from Sundeok High School.\\nFor her son whose immune levels had dropped, his mother boiled and served fruits after washing them thoroughly in water, searched the internet for study materials her son needed and printed them out, and even watched 'free preview lectures' of online courses to recommend them to him. Thanks to his mother's efforts, Kim received scholarships throughout his three years of high school.\\nHis study secret was 'consistency.' Throughout his three years of high school, he went to school at 8 AM and came home at 10:30 PM. Even up to a week before the CSAT, he did self-study until 9 PM. During evening self-study sessions, he mainly reviewed school lessons and listened to online lectures at home.\\nHe said, \\\"I didn't have any grand strategy or anything. I just studied whenever I had time. I tried to secure as much self-study time as possible and internalize what I learned to make it 'mine.'\\\"\\nOf course, Kim didn't always maintain top grades. He said he received a grade 3 in calculus during the first semester of his second year and a grade 3 in English during the second semester. Kim said, \\\"I was going to give up on my school records [GPA] and focus on the regular admission track, but then I thought I should just work hard on both.\\\"\\nOn the day of the CSAT, Kim said that after the test ended, he wandered around lost and came home after 2 hours had passed. When Kim's mother saw him, she cried profusely, saying \\\"What does it matter if you didn't do well on the test when you're this healthy?\\\" Kim's mother thought he had done poorly on the test and was wandering around before coming home late.\\nKim said, \\\"Mom cried when I was diagnosed with leukemia, and she cried in the taxi when I was receiving chemotherapy treatment. I didn't know mom would worry so much even on the day of the CSAT.\\\"\\nNetizens who learned about Kim's story reacted with comments like \\\"Even though he's someone else's child, he's admirable,\\\" \\\"He's the most impressive among all CSAT perfect scorers in history,\\\" \\\"His mom must have suffered a lot all this time,\\\" \\\"Really admirable, I hope he stays healthy,\\\" \\\"Excellent,\\\" \\\"It's a tear-inducing story,\\\" \\\"This is the most beautiful and wonderful story among all the acceptance stories I've seen,\\\" \\\"Really amazing. I hope he has a wonderful college life,\\\" and \\\"The son grew up well thanks to his mother's efforts.

This is supported by steadily rising entrance exam results and student satisfaction over the past five years, driven by the university's success in securing large-scale government support projects, various global programs, and a system that strengthens first-year students.\\n\\nSeoul Tech's University Support Project for Contributing to High School Education was introduced based on 'simplification of college entrance systems and transparency of information disclosure, fairness in college entrance system operations, school education-centered admission operations, and equal opportunity admission operations' to help universities assist students in preparing for college entrance and reduce their burden.\\n\\nIn response, Seoul Tech is specifically implementing plans such as 'abolishing interview exams for some comprehensive student record admissions (2018 academic year)', 'abolishing teacher recommendation letter submissions for comprehensive student record admissions (2019 academic year)', and 'reducing the weight of comprehensive student record admission interviews from 40% to 30% (2020 academic year)' to realize simplification of college entrance systems. Admission information is also provided in both online (school admission homepage, college entrance information portal-'Eodiga') and offline (various high school visit information sessions, college entrance fairs, etc.) formats to serve the convenience of test-takers. The school homepage operates by providing previous year admission scores by department, competition rates, and essay writing exam [a component of some university admissions] past questions to ensure no disruption in preparing for college entrance systems.\\n\\nSome call the comprehensive student record admission system the 'black box admission system.' This is because from the test-taker's perspective, it is difficult to understand what criteria are used for evaluation or why they received such scores. To solve this, Seoul Tech implements 'information-disadvantaged area information sessions' by directly visiting high schools in information blind spots such as island and remote areas to provide practical college entrance system information, and conducts 'mock comprehensive student record admissions' to provide customized information to students, contributing to reducing hagwon education [in Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry] costs. Additionally, they operate teacher college guidance capability strengthening programs, providing teacher training and teacher meetings for comprehensive student record admission guidance to help substantiate student record entries and strengthen college guidance capabilities.\\n\\nHong Hyeong-gi, Director of Seoul Tech's Admissions Management Division (pictured), said, \\\"Our university seeks to select field-oriented talent with practical knowledge and major suitability, global talent with global leadership and collaborative communication skills, ethical talent with proper character and moral judgment, creative talent who thinks creatively and learns self-directedly, and convergent talent with growth potential and integrative thinking ability.\\\" He added, \\\"We look forward to test-takers fully developing their dreams at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, which has high future value based on creative intelligence.\\\"\\n\\n2019 Academic Year Regular Admission:\\nMajor Increase in Recruitment for Materials Science and Engineering and Public Administration Departments\\n\\nSeoul Tech recruits a total of 793 students (excluding unfilled quota from early admission) in the 2019 academic year regular admission: 391 students in Group 'Ga' and 402 students in Group 'Na'.\\n\\nThe selection method remains the same as last year, selecting 100% based on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores (excluding arts and physical education departments), utilizing standard scores. The CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subject reflection method reflects Korean, Mathematics (Ga), English, and Inquiry for natural sciences, and Korean, Mathematics (Na), English, and Inquiry for humanities. Sports Science and Creative Writing departments reflect Korean, English, and Inquiry, while the College of Fine Arts reflects the higher scoring area between Mathematics (Ga), (Na) or Inquiry area along with Korean and English. Additionally, all recruitment units reflect 5% of the total score using Korean History grade-based scores (reflecting 2 inquiry subjects).\\n\\nWhile the overall selection reflection methods and ratios are almost identical to the previous year, the biggest change this year is the major increase in recruitment for Materials Science and Engineering and Public Administration departments by 31 students each (Materials Science and Engineering recruiting 50 students, Public Administration recruiting 46 students). Compared to the typically small annual changes in recruitment scale, this year reflects structural adjustments in these two departments, which will be a good opportunity for test-takers wishing to apply to these departments.\\n\\nAdditionally, among natural sciences applicants, test-takers who select Science Inquiry Area II subjects receive a 3% bonus based on their acquired scores. Students with deep interest and achievements in science areas should consider applying as it provides advantages in Seoul Tech's regular admission converted scores.\\n\\nSpecialized Departments Linked with UK Universities and Local Internship Opportunities\\n\\nSeoul Tech's specialized departments include the MSDE major and ITM major in Global Convergent Industrial Information Systems. Both majors operate joint degree programs between Seoul National University of Science and Technology and Northumbria University (located in Newcastle, UK). These programs receive annual educational certification from Q.A.A., a UK government agency, and all students in MSDE and ITM majors visit Northumbria University during their studies to participate in regular classes with British students and conduct projects, with all aviation and accommodation costs fully supported by the university. Additionally, students with excellent grades have the benefit of being dispatched as exchange students to the UK for one year and can receive scholarships from both universities simultaneously. Beyond this, opportunities for local UK industry internships are provided, along with participation opportunities in short-term US university training programs, with Seoul Tech supporting program costs and local accommodation expenses for participating students.\\n\\nBoth departments have employment rates above 80%, with over 60% of graduates finding employment at large corporations, foreign companies, and public enterprises, and many students continue research by entering famous domestic and international graduate schools.\\n\\nNational University's Reasonable Tuition and Scholarships from Student Voluntary Service, High-Satisfaction Dormitories\\n\\nSeoul Tech's scholarship system is at the national top level, with 61% of enrolled students receiving benefits based on the national university advantage of half-price tuition. Among these, the 'Student DREAM Mileage Scholarship' is a scholarship system where students voluntarily engage in volunteer work or capability-building activities, which are converted to points with a small amount paid per point, allowing students to receive up to 2,000 points (2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD]) during their studies and up to 500 points (500,000 won [approximately $380 USD]) per instance. This is significant in that it allows students to develop self-improvement habits on their own, and student satisfaction is quite high since it provides cash support rather than tuition reduction.\\n\\nAs for welfare systems, various dormitories can be highlighted. Currently operating 7 dormitories including Bulam Hall, KB Hall, and Seongrim Hall with a total capacity of 2,603 students. In terms of capacity rate relative to enrolled students (14.6%), this ranks 15th among 4-year universities in Seoul (out of 47 universities), and actual resident student satisfaction is also high.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4654, "output_tokens": 1707, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

At that time, the First Division of the Supreme Court (Chief Justice Kim Shin) determined that Pastor Oh should be viewed as having transferred to the seminary as a candidate for ministry, not as an ordained minister, and thus did not meet the pastoral requirements set forth in the denomination's constitution and could not become a minister of the denomination.\\n\\nFurthermore, the court stated: \\\"Although Pastor Oh claims to have received ordination from a Presbyterian denomination in the United States, his academic records only indicate that he graduated from a theological research program, with no record whatsoever of receiving ordination in America, and he has not submitted an ordination certificate.\\\" The court also noted that \\\"he himself acknowledges that 'I believe the documents were submitted under general transfer applicant qualifications.'\\\"\\n\\nIn contrast, the first and second instance courts had ruled against the plaintiffs, recognizing that Pastor Oh graduated from the pastoral transfer program at Chongshin University's seminary and passed the licentiate examination, thus meeting the pastoral qualifications set by the denomination and finding the appointment resolution to be legitimate.\\n\\nPreviously, in October 2003, the East Seoul Presbytery of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Korea resolved to appoint Pastor Oh Jeong-hyeon as the installed pastor (session moderator and senior pastor) of Sarang Church. Congregants including Mr. Kim filed this lawsuit, arguing that \\\"the resolution appointing Pastor Oh, who lacks qualifications, as the installed pastor representing the church is invalid.\\\"\\n\\nThe denomination's constitution stipulates that to become a pastor, one must graduate from seminary as a candidate for ministry under a presbytery of the denomination, pass the licentiate examination (for ministerial candidates in training), serve in ministry for at least one year, then pass the presbytery examination and receive pastoral ordination. Alternatively, ministers from other denominations or Presbyterian ministers ordained abroad must receive at least two years of instruction at seminary and pass the licentiate examination.\\n\\nAccordingly, in 2002, Chongshin University's seminary distinguished between a \\\"general transfer\\\" program for those transferring as candidates for ministry rather than as ordained ministers, and a \\\"pastoral transfer\\\" program for those transferring with ministerial credentials from other denominations or foreign ordination, announcing separate admission guidelines.\\n\\n[Seoul=Newsis]\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2748, "output_tokens": 771, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It's like a memorization subject. Sometimes even short passages don't read well.\\\" (Shin, a freshman)\\n\\nAfter the controversy over 'Korean question 31' on this year's CSAT, debates about Korean language education have heated up. Students and parents are expressing their burden about Korean and hurrying to hagwons.\\n\\nHowever, field teachers and Korean language education experts point out that the CSAT controversy is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are problems throughout our Korean language education overall. They say that not only are students unable to understand the context of entire texts because they're buried in fragmentary passage analysis and problem-solving, but 'communication illiteracy' is being mass-produced—students who are not illiterate but have difficulty with speaking or writing to express their own thoughts.\\n\\nDonga Ilbo conducted in-depth interviews with over 20 field teachers, students, expert professors, and hagwon education industry officials to diagnose the fundamental causes of how our 'native language' has become 'unknown Korean.' In the process, Korean language education stakeholders raised fundamental problems about our overall Korean education framework: △insufficient class time for proper reading, listening, writing, and speaking △reading culture where 'quantity over quality' matters △department store-style curriculum and syllabus pressure △educational composition focused on theory distant from real life △college entrance exam question format. They said the reality of Korean language education in Korea is so-called '4-absence education' where 'reading, listening, presentation, and writing' have disappeared.\\n\\nIn fact, Korean students' Korean language competency has proven its decline in international evaluations as well. Korea's reading scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) every three years, have continued to fall since 2006. Particularly shocking was the most recent 2015 evaluation, where high-level students decreased from 14.2% to 12.7%, while low-level students nearly doubled from 7.6% to 13.6%.\\n\\nKim Kyung-hoe, professor of education at Sungshin Women's University, lamented: \\\"Currently our PISA academic achievement is at the lowest level ever and last place among East Asian countries.

He began with an apology before the announcement. The content was that he was \\\"deeply sorry for causing confusion and worry to test-takers and parents due to the excessively difficult CSAT difficulty level.\\\" He didn't forget encouragement either. He urged, \\\"Even if you receive disappointing results, never be discouraged or frustrated. Let's use this as a precious opportunity for a new beginning.\\\" I'm not sure how much comfort this provided to students who had already bombed the test after everything was over.\\n\\nWatching this awkward and bitter scene of apology and consolation, I thought there was something else the education authorities should really apologize for. While such harsh realities of college entrance exams exist at the end of school life, they had misled young students into thinking they could live happily by just pursuing dreams and talents without really studying. Even aside from college admissions, due to the nature of human society, there inevitably must be evaluation and competition at every gateway like employment. However, it's true that education authorities had obscured schools' educational responsibilities by chanting 'happy education' to achieve their primary goal of 'reducing hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry]'.\\n\\nStudents' school life these days is vastly different from that of older generations. The biggest difference is that there are no 'unified exams' (tests taken by all grades together) like midterms or finals from first grade elementary through first grade middle school. However, elementary schools do conduct something called 'unit assessments' by class at the homeroom teacher's discretion to gauge children's understanding. These are often given without advance notice to prevent children from studying separately and experiencing excessive stress.\\n\\nSome progressive-leaning education superintendents operate 'homework-free schools' as key projects, not just eliminating tests. Overseas, they promoted 'homework-free schools' by emphasizing 'learning within school,' such as extending class periods from 45 to 65 minutes. But our approach is simply 'let's not stress elementary lower grades.' In situations where guidelines are effectively issued at the education office level, teachers only exhaust themselves by assigning homework and don't get any praise for it.\\n\\nStill, this much is okay. The problem starts from second grade middle school. After living a test-free life in first grade middle school under the names 'free semester system' and 'free year system,' children fall into shock when they take their first real 'exam' in second grade middle school. Even when they try to study belatedly, it's quite difficult since seven years have passed when they should have grasped basic concepts. Children who can only rely on school due to their circumstances have an even harder time. Those who cannot narrow this gap eventually remain as a group labeled 'below basic academic achievement.'\\n\\nIn an education system that encourages 'schools to teach less,' parents send their children to hagwon education with the mindset of 'if school won't make them do it, I will.' Mothers sometimes stick close to teach like teachers, even fighting with their children. Many 'do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do child education' figures we know also verbally advocate for happy education while actually having their own children walk the path of foreign language high schools, autonomous private high schools, gifted schools, and prestigious universities. If happy education is so good, why didn't they try it first with their own children?\\n\\nDue to the nature of my work as a reporter, I get to observe various forms of education from education special districts' methods to marginalized communities' situations. People commonly use the expression 'tilted playing field' regarding Korea's education gap, but when you actually look, it's not just tilted—it's a 'broken playing field.' Those who have means don't care if schools teach less. They don't rely only on schools anyway. Only ordinary people who were too busy making a living to know what the college entrance system was like, who trusted only schools, get blindsided. In that sense, what education authorities should really apologize for is abandoning public education to idealism while turning a blind eye to reality. That comes before apologizing for 'CSAT Korean question 31.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3403, "output_tokens": 1075, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Dongduk Women's University has been operating an admission prediction system since the 2018 rolling admissions. This is a service where students can access the admission prediction diagnosis system on Dongduk Women's University's admissions office homepage, input their scores and desired departments, and receive information about their admission possibilities.\\n\\nFor regular admissions, when students input their CSAT scores, the system displays admission possibilities categorized as stable, possible, or uncertain, along with recent admitted students' average grades and competition ratios for their desired departments. In particular, unlike other entrance exam placement charts, it receives favorable reviews from students because they only need to input raw scores without separately calculating standard scores or subject-specific converted scores.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dongduk Women's University, which became the first domestic four-year university to establish Applied Music and Modeling departments, also opened Korea's first Curator Studies department and, together with its Broadcasting and Entertainment department—the first among domestic women's universities—is solidifying its position in broadcasting culture. Student preference is also high, with the Applied Music department (vocal) showing a competition ratio of 113.25 to 1 in last year's entrance exams, while the Broadcasting and Entertainment department (daytime) and Modeling department recorded high competition ratios of 24.11 to 1 and 26.5 to 1, respectively.\\n\\nThe Applied Music department is particularly nurturing excellent musicians with expertise and originality through ensemble work that includes theoretical education in applied music and classical music, as well as various practical education.

Reporter Park Young-dae sannae@donga.com\\n\\nAt 3 PM on the 6th, at a wooden workshop in Oryu-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul. Kim Tae-su (47) and four university students put their heads together to discuss the price of a wooden monitor stand set to launch this month. However, the atmosphere was different from typical corporate meetings.\\n\\n\\\"How many meters of bubble wrap will we need for product packaging?\\\"\\n\\\"We'll probably need to wrap it about five times...\\\"\\n\\nWhen Kim spoke with a somewhat unclear and halting manner of speech and serious hand gestures, the hands of sign language interpreter Jeong Hye-kyung (56) beside him became busy. When Jeong conveyed Kim's meaning, Kang Shin-won (24), who was calculating product costs, let out a small \\\"Oh my...\\\" sigh. Kim, who is hearing-impaired, is the representative of 'Main Objet,' a company that manufactures and sells wooden design accessories. Kim creates the products while Sungkyunkwan University students handle sales. Marketing and promotion are also the students' responsibility.\\n\\nKim fell into a coma from meningitis around the end of summer vacation in first grade of elementary school and woke up after three days. He saved his life but lost his hearing in return. His world as the neighborhood's ringleader changed overnight. Maintaining friendships and studying became overwhelming. However, he graduated from regular schools through not only elementary but also middle and high school.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't have any particular determination as a child. My parents said, 'Even if it's a bit difficult, it would be better to attend regular school,' so that's what I did.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough he suffered emotionally during adolescence, attending regular school meant he had no fear of socializing with people and learning new things. However, the world 'feared' him. He interviewed at five universities but was told \\\"it would be difficult to attend classes with hearing impairment.\\\" He eventually majored in philosophy at a Russian university, and after returning to Korea, specialized in international sign language interpretation in graduate school. He later taught at universities including Nazareth University, but wasn't certain what his path should be.\\n\\nIn 2007, Kim began learning woodworking. At that time, the DIY (Do it yourself - consumers making desired items directly) trend had emerged. The appeal was creating products with designs he wanted himself. With support from the Korea Foundation for Persons with Disabilities, he learned woodworking twice a week for ten months at a workshop. While active at the Guro branch of the Seoul Association of the Deaf, he consistently made wooden crafts as a hobby.\\n\\nIn early 2015, students from the Sungkyunkwan University club 'EnActus' contacted him. EnActus is a club aimed at nurturing leaders who solve social problems through business projects. The students' concept was to create a business to address the self-realization and economic problems of hearing-impaired people, who have relatively more freedom in social life compared to other disabled people if they can use sign language.\\n\\n\\\"I was frustrated by not being employed, but the idea of becoming a business owner and directly employing myself was wonderful.\\\"\\n\\nKim, the students, and volunteer sign language interpreter Jeong joined forces, and after more than six months of meetings, they established Main Objet in September of that year, manufacturing wooden interior and office accessories. Though sales are modest, there's no giving up.\\n\\nMarketing manager Shin Dong-ju (23) said, \\\"After much deliberation last month, we held an event engraving Christmas messages on cypress wood sleep lamps, which generated about 1.4 million won [approximately $1,050 USD] in sales,\\\" adding with a laugh, \\\"It might seem small, but it's big money for us.\\\" Park Seon-wu (23) said, \\\"We're encouraged when customers leave supportive reviews on our website saying they 'bought quality products thanks to someone confidently engaging in economic activity regardless of disability.'\\\"\\n\\nMain Objet is working beyond profit-making business toward independence for other hearing-impaired people. Drawing inspiration from the positive response to woodworking classes Kim teaches at schools for the deaf, they want to create a space where hearing-impaired people can learn woodworking.\\n\\nTo this end, they applied last year to Seoul City's New Deal job program called 'Our Neighborhood Dedicated Artist.' This program pairs design-major young artists with small business owners one-on-one to improve store environments. Representative Kim and the students are renovating the workshop to be suitable for woodworking education for the hearing-impaired.\\n\\nKim said, \\\"I heard that a company with hearing-impaired employees that made President Moon Jae-in's shoes nearly went bankrupt but survived after receiving nearly 1 billion won [approximately $750,000 USD] in donations when it became known through the media. I hope that even without becoming a social issue, disabled people can receive education and business consulting anywhere and achieve independence.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3784, "output_tokens": 1260, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Teachers typically come to school for about one day during vacation to stand duty. However, KTU has signed collective agreements with eight education offices including Gangwon, Sejong, Incheon, North Jeolla, South Jeolla, Jeju, North Chungcheong, and South Chungcheong provinces that contain clauses 'prohibiting teachers from performing day-shift duties during vacations or after school hours,' and are refusing duty work based on these agreements.\\n\\nIn elementary school after-school care classrooms, principals and vice principals have to handle tasks like taking children to the hospital when they get sick. KTU's position is that student safety can be sufficiently handled by principals, vice principals, or dedicated care workers. However, even when students are not attending school, there are many administrative tasks to handle such as official documents and civil complaints, so principals and vice principals cannot dedicate themselves solely to after-school care classrooms. Dedicated care workers are not teachers, so they have no responsibility for student safety within the school outside of designated care locations or hours.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, vacation is a vacation for students, and teachers are supposed to conduct a kind of self-directed training during vacation. Principals can issue work orders to teachers whenever necessary during vacation, but the practice had been established of standing duty for about one day, which KTU has now broken. Many middle and high schools operate libraries and study rooms even during vacation, requiring someone to supervise students. Refusing to stand duty for about one day during a vacation of nearly a month, claiming it violates the right to rest, is not the attitude of a responsible teacher.\\n\\nThe benefits of after-school care classrooms mainly go to children from low-income families and dual-income households. Those who mainly use school libraries and study rooms are also students who find hagwon [private academy] fees burdensome. Unlike teachers in countries like the United States, Korean teachers receive their full monthly salary even during vacation, yet it is these vulnerable students who suffer from teachers' refusal to stand duty. Moreover, KTU is an outlawed union. Collective agreements signed with outlawed unions have no legal effect, and forcing these on frontline schools is essentially illegal. With even the Ministry of Education neglecting this situation while school operations suffer disruption, parents are left feeling frustrated.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2565, "output_tokens": 618, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Kyunghee High School, Paejae High School, Sehwa High School, Sinil High School, Sungmun High School, Ewha Womans University High School, Jungang High School, and Hanyang University High School had their designations cancelled, while the remaining 5 schools will continue their status, but they plan to jointly proceed with legal and administrative responses to this situation.\\n\\nHanyang University High School stated, \\\"We are focusing on ensuring students don't become unsettled\\\" and \\\"This isn't just our school's problem, so it's difficult to speak carelessly.\\\" Sehwa High School said, \\\"We thought we would naturally pass, but it's a confusing situation\\\" and conveyed the atmosphere, saying \\\"Teachers are gathering during every break to discuss countermeasures.\\\"\\n\\nOn the 9th, the day of the announcement, some principals of Seoul's autonomous private high schools reportedly met until late at night to discuss future countermeasures. The next day, on the 10th, around 4:30 PM, the principals gathered at Sehwa High School in Seoul to hold a general meeting. An official from the Seoul Autonomous Private High School Association hinted, \\\"At the time of the announcement, each school was busy analyzing evaluation results so scores couldn't be compiled,\\\" adding \\\"Now they're sharing scores together and are expected to prepare specific countermeasures.\\\"\\n\\nRebuttals also emerged against one of the frequently appearing arguments in 'autonomous private high school abolition theory' that \\\"autonomous private high schools should be eliminated because they operate like hagwons focused on college entrance exams.\\\" Kim Cheol-kyung, principal of Daekwang High School and president of the Seoul Autonomous Private High School Principals Association, appeared on a radio broadcast that day and said, \\\"We're working to nurture future talent while also providing college guidance,\\\" adding \\\"To be honest, as long as Korea's entrance exam system doesn't change, there won't be any schools that don't prepare students for college admission.\\\"\\n\\nSchools are currently agonizing over the pile of tasks before them, including addressing disputes over evaluation fairness while minimizing side effects when converting to general high schools. To challenge the education office about evaluation fairness and proceed with hearings, they need to know detailed scores, but these haven't been disclosed to each school yet. A Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education official said, \\\"Since we haven't requested consent from the Ministry of Education yet, the designation cancellations aren't finalized, so it's difficult to disclose detailed scores,\\\" adding \\\"We think schools need them for hearings, but we haven't discussed when we'll disclose them.\\\"\\n\\nThis isn't just Seoul's problem. Busan Haeundae High School also protested against the Busan Metropolitan Office of Education for not disclosing details except for scores in 6 areas and total points, and didn't attend the hearing scheduled for the 8th. Gyeonggi Ansan Dongsan High School also requested from the education office multiple times but only learned the scores just before the hearing. An Ansan Dongsan High School official pointed out, \\\"If they give us detailed indicators, we'd prepare for the hearing accordingly, so isn't that why?\\\" adding \\\"The administrative office is acting inappropriately.\\\"\\n\\nEven when inevitably converted to general high schools, problems remain. Large-scale adjustments to student numbers and class sizes are unavoidable not only for designation-cancelled schools but also for nearby general high schools. According to Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education data obtained by Dong-A Ilbo through Rep. Jeon Hee-kyung's office of the Liberty Korea Party on the 10th, Jungang High School, which had its designation cancelled this time, has only 17% local students (students residing in the area where the school is located). Hanyang University High School also has only 34%. The situations of other schools that had their designations cancelled this time are similar: Sinil High School (65%), Paejae High School (61%), Kyunghee High School (64%).\\n\\nThese schools have had a high proportion of students who deliberately came from other regions, but when converted to general high schools, they must receive most students assigned from within their districts. One autonomous private high school principal said, \\\"When converted to a general high school, our school's number of classes will be reduced by half, and we'll have to share students with nearby general high schools,\\\" adding \\\"Already, reactions are coming from surrounding schools saying 'it's difficult because student numbers are decreasing.'\\\"\\n\\nThere are also concerns that the efforts of autonomous private high schools that spent large amounts of money to expand facilities will come to nothing. Paejae High School built dormitories in 2012 at a cost of 12 billion won [approximately $9 million USD]. When converted to a general high school, it becomes difficult to recruit boarding students because nearby students will enroll. Confusion is also expected due to the 'one roof, two families' system where general high schools and autonomous private high schools coexist within one fence.\\n\\nReporter Kim Su-yeon sykim@donga.com\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3558, "output_tokens": 1273, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

During every break, all the teachers are discussing countermeasures together.\\\"\\n\\nA Sehwa High School teacher shared this assessment of the school atmosphere on the 10th, following the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's decision to cancel the school's designation in the autonomous private high school re-designation evaluation. A Hanyang University High School teacher, in a phone call with a Dong-A Ilbo reporter that day, was cautious in their words, saying \\\"We're focused on ensuring students don't get shaken by the news of failing re-designation\\\" and \\\"This isn't just our school's problem, so it's difficult to state our position.\\\"\\n\\nThe eight Seoul autonomous private high schools that failed the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's re-designation evaluation moved urgently throughout the day on the 10th to devise countermeasures. The principals of Seoul's 22 autonomous private high schools gathered at Sehwa High School from 4:30 PM that day to hold an emergency meeting regarding the re-designation evaluation results announced the previous day. In this meeting, the principals decided to demand detailed evaluation results by indicator that they had not yet received from the education office, and to compile cases of unfair evaluation for their response. The schools that received designation cancellation decisions were eight schools: Kyunghee High School, Paejae High School, Sehwa High School, Sungmun High School, Shinil High School, Ewha Womans University High School, Jungang High School, and Hanyang University High School.\\n\\nKim Cheol-kyung, principal of Daekwang High School and president of the Seoul Autonomous Private High School Principals Association, appeared on a radio broadcast on the 10th to actively defend against controversies surrounding autonomous private high schools. Particularly regarding the claim of \\\"autonomous private schools becoming exam hagwons,\\\" which is one of the main arguments of the \\\"autonomous private school abolition theory,\\\" Principal Kim said, \\\"We are providing college guidance while working to nurture future talent\\\" and \\\"Frankly speaking, as long as Korea's college entrance system doesn't change, there won't be any school that doesn't help students prepare for college admission.\\\"\\n\\nWhile autonomous private schools are raising questions about the fairness of the evaluation, they are also contemplating ways to minimize expected side effects when converting to regular high schools. Regarding not yet delivering detailed scores by indicator to the autonomous private schools, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education explained, \\\"We do think schools need this for hearings, but we haven't discussed when we'll make it public.\\\" This is not just Seoul's problem. Busan's Haeundae High School protested against the Busan Metropolitan Office of Education for not disclosing detailed evaluation content and refused to attend the hearing scheduled for the 8th. Gyeonggi's Ansan Dongsan High School was only able to learn detailed scores just before the hearing after making multiple requests to the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education.\\n\\nThe education sector is concerned that various problems could arise even if autonomous private schools that have entered the designation cancellation process are converted to regular high schools by the final decision of the Minister of Education. This is because not only the schools that had their designations cancelled, but also nearby regular high schools would inevitably need to adjust student numbers and class counts. According to data submitted by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to Rep. Jeon Hee-kyung of the Liberty Korea Party, Jungang High School, which had its designation cancelled this time, had only 17% of students from within the district (students residing in the area where the school is located). Hanyang University High School also had only 34%. Paejae High School (61%) and Kyunghee High School (64%) were also in the 60% range.\\n\\nOne autonomous private high school principal said, \\\"When converting to a regular high school, our school's class count will be reduced by half, and we'll end up sharing students with nearby regular high schools,\\\" adding \\\"Already, surrounding schools are reacting with 'It's troubling that student numbers are decreasing.'\\\" Autonomous private schools converting to regular high schools also face the challenge of operating a 'one roof, two families' system where regular high schools and autonomous private high schools coexist under one roof without conflict.\\n\\nMeanwhile, next year, a total of 50 schools are scheduled to undergo re-designation evaluation: 14 autonomous private high schools, 30 foreign language high schools, and 6 international high schools. The education sector is already saying, \\\"The possibility of an even worse mass cancellation situation than this year occurring next year cannot be ruled out.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3285, "output_tokens": 1134, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Assignment will be done through computerized lottery. Unlike when they were autonomous private high schools, application forms or personal statements are not needed.\\n\\nHowever, if the failed autonomous private high schools file injunction applications with courts to suspend the effect of the designation cancellation measures and the courts accept these, those schools will select students as autonomous private high schools this year. Like last year, students can apply to autonomous private high schools as their first choice and write regular high schools from their second choice onward in case they don't get accepted. Since court decisions are expected to come just before high school entrance procedures begin, students who haven't prepared admission documents in advance are expected to face difficulties.\\n\\nParents wanting to send their children to autonomous private high schools that will convert to regular high schools expect that teacher quality, college entrance exam know-how, and academic atmosphere will be maintained similarly to when they were autonomous private high schools. Parent B said, \\\"Autonomous private high schools have been maintained for 10 years, and schools that started as independent private high schools have been maintained for 17 years, so they'll naturally be better than just regular high schools.\\\" Some parents think that if their children enter as regular high school 1st-graders next year, they'll coexist with 2nd and 3rd-graders who entered as autonomous private high school students and will be subject to the autonomous private high school system together, even while paying tuition at one-third the level of autonomous private high schools.\\n\\nAmong parents, there are also those trying to send their children to autonomous private high schools in their region that were re-designated this year or to autonomous private high schools that recruit nationwide. They see sending children to re-designated schools as more stable than going to schools that were designated for cancellation or will be evaluated next year. Parent C said, \\\"I was only thinking about Sangsan High School, but I'm anxious about how the Ministry of Education will make its final decision,\\\" adding \\\"I'm considering sending my child to Pohang Iron & Steel High School or Hyundai Chung Un High School, which recruit nationwide and were re-designated.\\\"\\n\\nIn Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho areas where Sehwa High School was eliminated, competition for Jungdong High School is expected to rise more than for Whimoon High School. This is because Whimoon High School will be evaluated next year, but Jungdong High School passed re-designation this year. Parent D said, \\\"I don't know why we have to worry about such things. I wish the government would work hard on revitalizing public education rather than abolishing autonomous private high schools.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2899, "output_tokens": 871, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Without a foundation in physics, it was impossible for him to understand his major classes. Eventually, after paying 500,000 won [approximately $380 USD] per month for tutoring from a prestigious university engineering student, he received A grades in three major subjects this semester.\\n\\nStudents who used to receive tutoring for college admissions are increasingly receiving tutoring even after entering university to earn credits in their major subjects. Upon entering university, science and engineering students are choosing tutoring because they lack the basic knowledge needed for their major classes.\\n\\nThis is analyzed to be caused by the strong tendency among many students who completed science tracks in high school to avoid physics and chemistry as CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] elective subjects (2 subjects), as well as the significant number of liberal arts students who cross-apply to science programs.\\n\\nKim (25), who is enrolled in a chemical engineering program at a regional four-year university, said, \\\"I didn't even take chemistry on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], but I enrolled because I heard it was a department with good employment prospects,\\\" adding, \\\"After receiving failing grades in basic chemistry and feeling stressed, I received 5-hour problem-solving tutoring sessions from a friend who studied well during every exam period.\\\"\\n\\nTutoring fees exceed high school levels.

There's no choice if you want to go to a major law firm\\\"\\n\\nA second-year student at Seoul National University Law School used up 118 pens completely during studying in the first semester of this year. The student said, \\\"Sometimes I feel proud when I keep stacking up the used pens, which helps relieve academic stress a little.\\\" Reporter Park Sang-jun speakup@donga.com\\n\\nMr. K, a first-year student at a law school in Seoul, did not go to school on the 14th. To advance to second year, Mr. K had to take a 'preliminary exam' that day. However, he gave up on the exam. Instead, Mr. K sat in a lecture hall at another university in Seoul that day. And he solved language and logical reasoning problems. It was the 'Legal Education Eligibility Test (LEET)' that must be taken to enter law school next year. Mr. K said, \\\"If I go to an SKY [Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University] law school, it will be much easier to get a job at a major law firm\\\" and \\\"I'm investing one year for my future.\\\"\\n\\nLike Mr. K, there are quite a few so-called 'transfer applicants' who, even after breaking through fierce competition to enter law school, jump back into law school admissions to change their school nameplate. 'Transfer application' refers to preparing for entrance exams to other schools while attending school. Students at Seoul-based law schools prepare for entrance exams again to enter law schools at the so-called 'SKY' - 'Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University.' Students at regional law schools do 'transfer applications' to enter law schools in Seoul.\\n\\nMs. H (27, female), who had been studying at a regional law school for two years, started 'transfer applications' in July last year. It was right after hearing news that a friend got a job at a major law firm in Seoul. The friend was attending one of the 'SKY law schools.' The friend said she had already received a job offer when working as an intern at a major law firm after finishing her first year. The law firm that hired her friend had never even come to Ms. H's school for recruitment presentations. Ms. H thought she needed to go to an 'SKY law school' to get internship opportunities that could lead to employment at major law firms. Ms. H passed admission to a Seoul law school that wasn't 'SKY' in January this year. However, she is thinking of submitting applications again this year to go to an 'SKY law school.'\\n\\nMs. P (26, female), who attended another regional law school, found a short-term monthly rental room in Sinchon, Seoul in June last year. It was to prepare for LEET for one month. Ms. P devoted 12 hours a day to LEET preparation. Ms. P said, \\\"I once bought and studied test materials online that 'SKY law school' students supposedly use\\\" and \\\"I did transfer applications because I felt that no matter how hard I studied in the provinces, I would fall behind in the 'information war.'\\\"\\n\\nAccording to materials registered by all 25 law schools nationwide on the university information disclosure site 'University Info,' more than 100 students drop out of law school every year. 116 dropped out in 2015, 109 in 2016, and 111 in 2017. Most were for transfer applications. At one private university law school in Seoul, 22 students - close to 7% of the enrollment (334 students) - dropped out last year alone. Given this situation, law schools other than 'SKY law schools' sometimes schedule scholarship-linked exams on the same day as LEET to prevent current students from making transfer applications.\\n\\nLaw school students who have attempted transfer applications say \\\"ultimately, the school nameplate determines employment.\\\" When this newspaper investigated all 117 new lawyers who were employed at five major law firms (Kim & Chang, Bae Kim & Lee, Yulchon, Sejong, Hwang Mok Park) from January to July this year, 92 were from 'SKY law schools,' accounting for 78% of the total. Only 4 (3.4%) were graduates of regional law schools. Among 55 newly appointed prosecutors last year, 30 (54.6%) were from 'SKY law schools,' and among 56 judicial research officers (law clerks), 14 (25%) were from these schools.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3431, "output_tokens": 1078, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

According to auction information company Jiji Auction, the daily average number of auctions conducted in June this year was 551 cases, recording the highest figure in three years. After 607 cases were conducted daily on average in May 2016, the number continued to decline, but transaction volume has increased this year. This year, the successful bid rate for Seoul apartment auctions (successful bid price compared to appraised price) has maintained the high 90% range except for February and March, while the number of properties being traded is increasing.\\n\\nAt 10 AM on the 21st, at the auction court of Seongnam Branch of Suwon District Court in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. As the bell rang and the judge said \\\"We will begin bidding,\\\" participants rushed forward with their bid envelopes. More than 130 people crowded into the courtroom with only about 40 seats, leaving no room to step even in the corridor.\\n\\nA total of 30 properties were put up for auction that day. As successful bidders were called out one by one, applause erupted, creating a mix of excitement and tension. Housewife Yoon Mi-jeong (37), who visited an auction court for the first time, gave a thumbs up to the auction consultant who came with her and smiled brightly after successfully bidding on her desired property. Ms. Yoon said, \\\"The appraised price was about 600 million won [approximately $450,000 USD], but I won the bid at 530 million won [approximately $397,000 USD], more than 10% cheaper,\\\" adding \\\"I'm satisfied to have obtained the house I wanted at a cheap price.\\\"\\n\\nWhile the housing transaction market has frozen due to the government's various real estate regulations, investors targeting niche markets such as court auctions appear to be increasing. Jang Jae-hyeon, general manager at Real Today, said, \\\"Since the economy is not doing well, there are many properties that have come up for auction,\\\" adding \\\"Among these, there's a trend of investors also increasing who want to pick smart properties.\\\"\\n\\nThe place where this atmosphere can be felt most clearly is in the auction hagwon districts. At 7 PM on the 24th, 15 students gathered at an auction hagwon near Seoul Central District Court in Seocho-gu, Seoul. They ranged from office workers in their 30s and 40s to gray-haired people in their 60s and those in their 20s who just started their careers. Tense concentration continued throughout the 3-hour class time, afraid to miss the instructor's words. Auction instructor Hwang Jong-hwa said, \\\"Including online lectures, students have increased by about 20% compared to last year,\\\" adding \\\"The increase in students in their 20s who are very interested in real estate is a phenomenon we haven't seen before.\\\"\\n\\nAs demand for auction knowledge has become more specific and segmented, auction hagwons have recently diversified their class types to include on-site inspections, small-scale investment, and purchase consulting. An auction hagwon official said, \\\"Since auctions require individuals to directly analyze property registrations and such, many investors come to acquire professional knowledge,\\\" adding \\\"Classes that include property recommendations sometimes charge tuition fees of over 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] per month.\\\"\\n\\nWhile real estate loan regulations also apply to auctions, there are cases where people circumvent regulations by establishing real estate trading corporations. While individuals or rental business operators can only receive loans up to 40% of the house price due to strengthened loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, corporations can receive loans up to 80%. Office worker Mr. Lee (35) said, \\\"Last month I established a corporation and received an 80% loan to successfully bid 10.5 billion won [approximately $786,000 USD] for an apartment in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area with a market price of 1.2 billion won [approximately $899,000 USD],\\\" adding \\\"Reconstruction issues came up quickly and it has now risen to 1.5 billion won [approximately $1.12 million USD], so people around me ask about auction investment methods.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, experts advise that auctions require careful investment as they carry significant investment risks along with profitability. Particularly during periods of declining house prices, one must be careful of illusions regarding appraised prices. Since appraised prices of auction properties are usually calculated several months before bidding, they are often set higher than current market prices, so caution is needed when determining bid amounts. Jeong Choong-jin, representative lawyer at Open Law Firm, said, \\\"There are quite a few auction properties where the appraised value is actually higher than the market price, and if unexpected conflicts with tenants arise, you may end up paying more than the successful bid price.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Yoo Won-mo\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3492, "output_tokens": 1204, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This admission plan involves equally distributing admissions into three categories of 33% each: 'regional balance selection' centered on school records, 'special talent selection' centered on school life records, and 'regular admission' centered on essay exams. This can be seen as an intention to autonomously select students with excellent qualifications while respecting the education authorities' policy commitment to normalizing public education through standardization.\\n\\nThe problem is the essay-centered 'regular admission.' Of course, even in this case, the weight of school records (40%) and interviews (20%) remains high, but the practical determinant of acceptance or rejection appears likely to be decided by the essay exam (40%). Seoul National University announced that it would conduct a new type of essay examination, but if they cleverly conduct bon-gosa-style exams under the name of essay exams, serious side effects are expected. Even now, there are countless universities that conduct exams in bon-gosa format when you look inside, even though they're called essay exams in name only.\\n\\nSeoul National University has also drawn a line saying it will avoid bon-gosa-style essay exams. Although specific research should follow, considering the position of frontline high schools and test-takers who are desperate for Seoul National University admission, there is a need to disclose question types as soon as possible to relieve anxiety.\\n\\nAnd the current method of writing approximately 2,500-character answers over three hours with a single question has much room for improvement in that it is not significantly different from CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), which evaluates several years of learning process in just one day. I would like to make several suggestions regarding the new type of essay examination that Seoul National University is envisioning.\\n\\nFirst, essay questions must be dealt with within the scope of the high school curriculum. Students who are faithful to school studies without taking hagwon classes or private tutoring should be able to solve them sufficiently. Questions that require excessively abstract or high-level thinking abilities could rather become a pretext for the proliferation of hagwon education.\\n\\nSecond, changes in the number of questions and answer writing are required. In other words, while writing ability is also important, evaluating the degree of knowledge and application ability comes first. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately verify test-takers' intellectual level from various angles by requiring answers of not long length (around 700 characters per question) for at least five questions instead of a single question as currently done.\\n\\nThird, it is necessary to conduct questions at the department or major level in addition to the current college and school-level question setting. Rather than evaluation centered on basic literacy as now, it is desirable to measure specific abilities related to majors. For example, we could consider having the English Literature department ask questions about English utilization ability, the Law department about basic abilities and qualifications as legal professionals, and the Business Administration department about economic common sense and business mindset.\\n\\nFourth, it should serve as an opportunity to evaluate broad reading ability. Since reading ability is difficult to depend on hagwon education, it is necessary to instill the recognition that reading various types of books is much more advantageous for college admission than students clinging to hagwons or private tutoring. If the importance of reading increases in Seoul National University essays, reading education at frontline high schools will also be activated.\\n\\nThrough these several principles, Seoul National University will be able to catch two rabbits simultaneously: universities' student selection rights and the normalization of public education. In that regard, I hope this admission plan can lead to an evaluation of 'meaningful progress in essay exams' rather than the 'revival of bon-gosa' that many people are concerned about.\\n\\nChoi Jin-gyu, School teacher at Seoryeong High School, Chungnam [South Chungcheong Province]\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3225, "output_tokens": 960, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This education reform agenda brought about a paradigm shift toward student-centered education policy and served as the backbone of education policy for subsequent administrations. Our newspaper's education team, in collaboration with the Korean Association for the Study of Education Politics (Chairman Lim Cheon-soon, Professor at Sejong University), conducted research and analysis on 'The Achievements and Failures of 10 Years of Education Reform.' The research results will be presented at a seminar on June 17th.》\\n\\n▽Background of Education Reform = President Kim Young-sam established the Education Reform Commission upon taking office in 1993 to implement his presidential campaign education pledges.\\nThe Education Reform Commission emphasized excellence education to resolve the chronic entrance exam hell and to strengthen globalization and national competitiveness, which were key national governing philosophies. Under the goal of transitioning to competitive logic and education consumer-centered policies in education, it presented a blueprint for this purpose.\\nSubsequently, the Kim Dae-jung administration created the New Education Community Committee and the Education and Human Resources Policy Committee, while the Roh Moo-hyun administration established the Education Innovation Committee to continue improving education policy.\\nProfessor Lim Cheon-soon said, 'The Education Reform Commission's education policies contain many groundbreaking elements even when evaluated now,' adding 'Most are currently being implemented, or many are scheduled to be introduced, such as medical and dental graduate schools and law schools.'\\n\\n▽Different Policy Colors by Administration = As the Kim Young-sam administration emphasized consumer-centered education reform, improvements to the college entrance system, high school application-first lottery-second assignment, open education, and school management committees were implemented.\\nWhile autonomy was enhanced through university enrollment liberalization and the introduction of university establishment standards, there are criticisms that this became one of the causes of current university restructuring.\\nAlthough the Kim Young-sam administration kept its promise to secure 5% of Gross National Product (GNP) for education budget at the end of its term, this was shaken when Korea came under International Monetary Fund (IMF) [economic bailout program] management in 1997, and the Kim Dae-jung administration's education policy focused on efficiency.\\nThe teacher retirement age reduction measure received public support but caused fierce opposition and cynicism among teachers. As voluntary retirement increased, elementary school teachers became severely short-staffed, causing confusion by having to rehire retired teachers. By allowing teacher unions, the KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) became legalized.\\nThe Roh Moo-hyun administration emphasized equity and public nature in education, leading to ideological debates in the education field. The Innovation Committee's composition and policy content were heavily ideologically biased with many unrealistic elements, sometimes causing conflicts with the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development.\\nProfessor Shin Hyun-seok (Education) at Korea University said, 'The legalization of student councils, teacher councils, and parent councils is a mass participatory policy,' evaluating that 'The participatory government has the problem of policy absence amid ideological excess.'\\nProfessor Lee Il-yong (Education) at Chung-Ang University emphasized, 'It's important for committees to have bipartisan human composition and derive policies through national consensus.'\\n\\n▽Characteristics of Committee Participants = The Education Reform Commission had 72 members, the New Education Community Committee 37, the Education and Human Resources Policy Committee 22, and the Innovation Committee 19, with the number decreasing as administrations changed.\\nSeoul National University professors Lee Myung-hyun (Philosophy), Moon Yong-lin (Education), and Lee Don-hee (former Seoul National University professor), along with Minjok Leadership Academy principal, served as committee chairmen or standing members before being appointed as Minister of Education.\\n73.6% of Education Reform Commission members, 59.5% of New Education Community Committee members, and 81.8% of Education and Human Resources Policy Committee members were from Seoul, but this dropped to 31.6% for the Innovation Committee. This shows the notable advancement of regional representation as the participatory government emphasized participation and local decentralization.\\nBy occupation, university professors comprised 47.3%, elementary/middle/high school teachers 17.3%, education organizations 16.7%, social organizations 9.3%, journalists 6%, and business 3.3%.\\n\\n[TABLE: Comparison of Education Policies Under Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung, and Roh Moo-hyun Administrations]\\n\\nCategory | Kim Young-sam Civilian Government (Feb 1993–Feb 1998) | Kim Dae-jung People's Government (Feb 1998–Feb 2003) | Roh Moo-hyun Participatory Government (Feb 2003–present)\\n\\nEducation Ministers: 5 (average tenure 12 months) | 7 (8.6 months) | 4 (8 months)\\n\\nEducation Organizations: Education Reform Commission | New Education Community Committee, Education and Human Resources Policy Committee | Education Innovation Committee\\n\\nMajor Policies:\\n- 5·31 Education Reform Plan announcement\\n- Prohibition of university-specific exams focused on Korean, English, and Math at national universities\\n- Introduction of comprehensive school records\\n- Improvement of school choice (application-first, lottery-second assignment)\\n- Introduction of establishment standards, diversification of school types\\n- University enrollment liberalization\\n- Establishment of school management committees\\n- Introduction of principal recruitment system\\n- Expansion of open education\\n| - Elevation to Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development (deputy prime minister level)\\n- Teacher retirement age reduced to 62\\n- Legalization of teacher unions, teacher performance pay system\\n- Comprehensive Teacher Development Plan\\n- Diversification of school types including autonomous private high schools\\n- Elementary/middle/high school education environment improvement project\\n- Changes to college entrance including abolition of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] total score system\\n- Brain Korea 21 project\\n- Expansion of middle school compulsory education\\n| - Announcement of 2·17 hagwon education reduction measures\\n- College entrance system reform (CSAT and school records 9-grade system)\\n- Promotion of Private School Law revision\\n- Promotion of legalization of student councils, teacher councils, and parent councils\\n- Reorganization of vocational education system\\n- Scheduled pilot implementation of teacher evaluation system\\n- Expansion of education welfare budget\\n- Local University Innovation Capacity Enhancement Project\\n- Promotion of university restructuring\\n\\nEducation Policy Characteristics: Neoliberalism based on competitive logic | Communitarianism, populism | Emphasis on equity and public nature, mass participationism\\n\\nProblems: Few monopolized education reform ideology setting, insufficient integration efforts due to top-down policy | Emphasis on efficiency under IMF management system, Lee Hae-chan-style reforms caused teacher cynicism, lack of consistency between reform proposals and policy implementation | Policy absence amid ideological excess\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4014, "output_tokens": 1717, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Yonhap\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has created assessment guidelines requiring elementary schools from 3rd grade and above to use only descriptive assessment starting from the second semester, and plans to increase the proportion of descriptive assessment in middle and high schools to at least 30% from this year, gradually expanding to 50%.\\nFor this purpose, the education office developed and released sample questions (approximately 1,400 for elementary and 350 for middle school) on the 9th that elementary, middle, and high schools can use for reference.\\nBaek Seung-han, evaluation director at Edutopia Central Education, said, 'As short-answer and multiple-choice questions familiar to students decrease, the burden on students increases,' adding, 'Study methods will also need to change accordingly.'》\\nDescriptive assessment is 'assessment that responds to given questions with multiple sentences,' and short-answer subjective questions are not included in descriptive assessment.\\nMainly requiring answers like 'interpret,' 'give examples,' or 'write an outline,' the plan is to focus on descriptive-type questions first and gradually increase essay-writing exam questions.\\nThe reason the education office introduced descriptive assessment is to improve academic achievement, believing it can enhance students' thinking skills, creativity, and real-life application abilities.\\nIn fact, the education sector also expects that exams will inevitably become more difficult when descriptive assessment becomes mainstream. Unlike before, it will be difficult to achieve good grades through simple memorization of knowledge or fragmented knowledge.\\nThe process of finding answers is as important as obtaining the final answer, making it fundamentally impossible to get correct answers by 'guessing.'\\n'Writing' ability also becomes important in descriptive assessment. The ability to express one's thoughts or knowledge coherently is a basic evaluation criterion. Therefore, it's helpful to show what you've written to others and check how well they understood it.\\nHowever, for Korean and English subjects, having many spelling errors doesn't result in a '0' score. Since excessive reflection of specific grading elements like spelling could damage the original purpose of descriptive assessment, schools create and apply appropriate grading standards.\\nKim Hyeon-jung, supervisor in charge of secondary education evaluation at the education office, said, 'Descriptive assessment checks how much students have achieved the learning objectives of each unit,' adding, 'Students should faithfully study the learning objectives for each textbook unit in all subjects.'\\nThe sample questions released this time will not appear in actual exams. All elementary sample questions developed this time will be released on elementary school websites in early July after first-semester final exams end.\\nSim Eun-seok, supervisor in charge of elementary education evaluation at the education office, said, 'We sent guidelines to schools not to use them for assessment,' adding, 'Training with sample questions at hagwons and similar institutions won't be helpful.'\\nReporter Lee Na-yeon larosa@donga.com\\n▼10 Commandments for Preparing for Descriptive Assessment▼\\n① Develop reading comprehension and expression skills through steady reading.\\n② Practice writing consistently and ask others to correct your writing.\\n③ Understand learned content and try summarizing it in complete sentences.\\n④ Check unit learning activities and organize them into sentences.\\nⅤ Before writing answers, check criteria like 'summarize within ~ [words/characters].'\\n⑥ Practice explaining textbook charts or graphs in words.\\n⑦ Read many subject-related books for science, math, etc.\\n⑧ Learn even one piece of knowledge accurately and thoroughly.\\n⑨ Write answers as concisely as possible without unnecessary content.\\n⑩ When studying, organize your thoughts about 'why.'\\n▼Elementary Descriptive Assessment▼\\nIn Seoul elementary schools where school-level 'academic achievement assessment' was revived this year, exams will be conducted using descriptive assessment starting from the second semester.\\nThe target is grades 3-6, covering four major subjects: Korean, math, social studies, and science. The number of questions is 4-10 per subject, and there are also 'level-differentiated questions' where scores vary depending on how much of an answer was provided for one question.\\nHowever, grades are not calculated 100% based solely on academic achievement assessment. Schools and teachers can autonomously decide factors for grading. Teachers can individually give 'quiz tests' or partially reflect performance assessment [school-based assessment that is not a standardized exam].\\nEven with academic achievement assessment, overall rankings and subject-specific rankings are not disclosed as they currently are not.\\n▼Middle and High School Descriptive Assessment▼\\nDescriptive assessment for middle and high school students applies only to five major subjects: Korean, English, math, social studies, and science, and will be gradually expanded.\\nThis year, targeting 1st-year middle school and 1st-year high school students, 30% of total assessment must be descriptive assessment. Next year, it will expand to 40% for 1st and 2nd-year middle school and 1st and 2nd-year high school students.\\nIn 2007, the plan is to increase it to 50% for all middle and high school students.\\nPerformance assessment [school-based assessment that is not a standardized exam] is separate from descriptive assessment, so if performance assessment [school-based assessment that is not a standardized exam] is 30% of the total, overall grades consist of △descriptive assessment 30% △performance assessment [school-based assessment that is not a standardized exam] 30% △multiple-choice objective questions 40%.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4265, "output_tokens": 1520, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Advice from Four Experts\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Reporter Jeon Young-han\\n《With major universities announcing that they will strengthen essay-writing exams and in-depth interviews starting from the 2008 academic year college admissions, test-takers and parents are anxious, not knowing how to prepare. This newspaper held a roundtable discussion with four experts who participate in the essay-writing guidance for our newly established 'Essay-Writing Clinic' section: Lee Man-gi, director of 'Lee Man-gi's Korean Language World,' Professor Park Jeong-ha of Sungkyunkwan University (in charge of academic writing), Lee Seok-rok, director of Daechi MegaStudy Hagwon [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], and Choi Gang, director of Choi Gang Hagwon. We heard their views on the new admissions direction and essay-writing exam preparation methods.》\\n\\n○ 2008 College Admissions and Essay-Writing Exam Types\\n―Looking at the basic plans for the 2008 academic year college admissions announced by Seoul National University and other universities, the characteristic feature is the strengthening of essay-writing exams and in-depth interviews. Sample test format examples are scheduled to be released around October, and the content and format of essay-writing exams are expected to diversify.\\n―There could be methods such as providing different passages by recruitment unit, or diversifying the ways of summarizing and evaluating passages. Topics that require rich background knowledge to write about may also appear.\\n―Essay-writing exam types include 'integrated curriculum type' that asks about course content and essay-writing that measures comprehensive thinking ability. The integrated curriculum type will be in a format that encompasses multiple subjects and will try to evaluate creative thinking ability and analytical skills.\\n―Designated-type essay-writing exams are also possible, where they designate books to read and ask questions from them. The format of reading English passages and presenting one's own views seems likely to expand as well.\\n\\n○ Elementary, Middle, and High School Assessment Changes\\n―The descriptive and essay-writing type assessments being introduced in elementary, middle, and high schools are desirable and seem likely to expand.\\n―If essay-writing exams and in-depth interviews are strengthened and descriptive and essay-writing type assessments become common in schools, teaching methods will also change significantly.\\n―Problem-posing learning, that is, discussion-based learning, is necessary. Students need to develop the ability to think about issues with their own minds and organize their thoughts in writing or speech.\\n―To perform well on descriptive and essay-writing type assessments, students must be faithful to school classes. It would be effective to practice selecting content that teachers emphasize and writing it in 100-200 characters.\\n\\n○ Using Newspapers\\n―Good use of newspapers can also help with essay-writing exams. Newspapers are the medium most closely related to logic. To persuade readers, arguments and evidence must be accurate and logical.\\n―Newspapers contain various social phenomena, making them 'living' essay-writing textbooks. They are also very helpful for studying language, social studies, and science inquiry areas.\\n―Special feature articles are well-organized regarding what specific issues become problems related to controversies and what positions are in conflict. Through editorials and columns, you can learn how to develop your own arguments.\\n\\n○ How to Excel at Essay-Writing Exams\\n―To adapt well to the changed assessment system, students must first develop background knowledge and expressive abilities. It's good to carefully read social-related subjects like ethics and social culture. Especially, the ethics subject's textbook table of contents is itself an excellent essay-writing practice problem set. Korean language reading and composition textbooks are also useful materials.\\n―Humanities students should study by linking English and reading. They will be asked to understand the content of texts through English passages and then be tested on essay-writing or oral abilities related to them. Science students should strengthen their mathematics and science abilities.\\n―High school students don't have much time to prepare for essay-writing exams. It's also good to carefully read passages from CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] language section reference books or problem sets. Students must write a lot. It's even better if they receive correction guidance from teachers. It's also desirable for friends to share their writing and discuss it together.\\n―If students consistently train in writing short 'simple essay-writing pieces' from elementary and middle school, they will later be able to write relatively long pieces easily. In any case, students must develop the habit of reading many books and thinking.\\n\\nEach University's 2008 College Admissions Essay-Writing Exam Trends\\n\\nSeoul National University\\n―Integrated curriculum type. Diversifying types by recruitment unit. Answer length varies from 100-2,500 characters depending on the nature of the question\\n\\nKorea University\\n―Strengthening the weight of essay-writing exams. Making the weight of school records and essay-writing exams similar\\n\\nYonsei University\\n―Introducing essay-writing exams for science tracks as well. Developing essay-writing exams that can measure both creativity and thinking ability\\n\\nSogang University\\n―Integrated curriculum type. Strengthening English-mixed essay-writing exams and in-depth interviews in rolling admissions\\n\\nSungkyunkwan University\\n―Integrated curriculum type. Introducing essay-writing exams for science tracks as well. Test-takers choose between essay-writing type and interview type\\n\\nHanyang University\\n―Integrated curriculum type. Science tracks link with mathematics and science subjects, humanities tracks use cross-curricular themes and materials from language and foreign language subjects\\n\\nHankuk University of Foreign Studies\\n―Strengthening the weight of essay-writing exams.

Reporter Jeon Young-han\\n\\nOn the 8th, amid heated controversy over Seoul National University's revival of comprehensive exams [본고사, university-administered entrance exams that were abolished in favor of standardized testing] for the 2008 academic year, about 500 parents flocked to create chaos at an explanatory session on 'Critical Reading and Discussion Essay Writing' held at the Busan International Newspaper main auditorium in Yeonje-gu's Jungang-ro.\\n\\nPark Seung-ryeol, director of LC Education Research Institute, a specialized reading and essay hagwon that hosted the event, said, \\\"We've been holding nationwide tour information sessions since May, and we were surprised by the recent essay fever ourselves,\\\" adding \\\"Before May, we had about 20 franchises, but recently it has increased to about 100.\\\"\\n\\nFollowing the comprehensive exam controversy between the government ruling party and Seoul National University, hagwon districts in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and other areas are showing a trend of significantly increased essay hagwons and related courses ahead of summer vacation.\\n\\n▽\\\"Master essays first\\\"=Looking at the hagwon district in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu, Seoul, so many essay hagwons are emerging that essay hagwon signs are noticeable on every building. Social studies and science inquiry specialized hagwons are also converting to essay hagwons or establishing new essay courses. Ahead of summer vacation, hagwons plan to hold a series of explanatory sessions for parents about summer vacation intensive courses starting from the 15th.\\n\\nCheon Wan-su, director of the Seoul Gaepo branch of 'Park Hakcheon Essay Classroom,' said, \\\"Previously we received 20-30 inquiry calls per day, but recently it's over 100 calls, to the point where we can't even eat meals.\\\"\\n\\nThe situation is the same in rural areas.

This anxiety is driving them toward essay-writing hagwons. These essay-writing hagwons were, until just recently, school records or CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] hagwons.\\n\\nHowever, I'm not sure whether Seoul National University's essay exam should be drawing this much attention at this point.\\n\\nThe first reason is that Seoul National University has not provided guidelines on what type of questions it will present for the essay exam. Arguing about the nature of questions that haven't even been released is no different from getting worked up about whether an unborn baby will be handsome or ugly while it's still in the womb.\\n\\nThis is also why I think this controversy is not an educational issue but rather a decidedly political one. The behavior of adding plausible interpretations to non-existent problems to rally supporters is nothing more than political maneuvering designed to undermine opponents.\\n\\nSecond, there is no entrance exam system that satisfies everyone. The entrance exam system itself is a system that filters people through competition. Naturally, positions will differ according to one's interests. If a child attends a specialized high school, parents will support an entrance exam system favorable to specialized schools, and if a child fails to get into a specialized school and attends a regular school, they will demand a system favorable to regular schools. This is parental psychology.\\n\\nAdding to this, the misconception that students who receive a lot of hagwon education [private tutoring through hagwons] will have an advantage if integrated essay exams are implemented is also contributing to the confusion. First, we need to examine where such claims were initially raised. The people who first made such statements were not from the hagwon industry. Nor were they parents. These claims were made by certain civic groups and parent organizations that advocate for educational equality.\\n\\nRather, hagwon districts are currently struggling for survival after encountering the 'unexpected obstacle' of integrated essay exams. Hagwons may have competitive advantages in memorization and advanced learning to prepare for multiple-choice questions as they do now. However, schools, not hagwons, are the places that can prepare students for questions that measure thinking ability by combining two or three subjects.\\n\\nOne hagwon director confessed, 'We're also trying to prepare by obtaining lecture notes from Seoul National University professors, but given that we don't know which professors from which majors will form what kind of team to create what kinds of questions, there are limits to teaching integrated essay writing.'\\n\\nWhat's more worrying is Seoul National University, which must create new types of questions. I'm curious whether they have the ability to dispel misunderstandings about main subject exams [bonggosa] and create questions, and if so, how. To create integrated essay exams, dozens of faculty members would need to conduct seminars and retreats for several months. During that period, they might have to completely suspend research and lectures.\\n\\nSo I'd like to suggest that we set aside this unnecessary and wasteful controversy and wait for now. Confused about whether to prepare for essays, school records, or CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]? This is merely the logic of the hagwon education market, which can only do business by exploiting parents' anxieties. Am I being overly optimistic in thinking that these three areas are not really different from each other?\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3071, "output_tokens": 876, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

There is a confrontation between the argument that it is time to reexamine the high school equalization system that has brought about downward leveling for the sake of national competitiveness, and the positive evaluation that there is no research showing high school equalization has lowered academic achievement and that it is a policy that has contributed to preventing schools from becoming overly entrance exam-oriented institutions.》\\n\\n▼Guaranteeing Educational Choice Rights is Natural▼\\n\\nThe equalization system achieved considerable success in the 1970s and 80s. The state standardized schools, educational content, and evaluation, seeking to raise the overall quality of these elements. As a result, high-quality education could be disseminated cheaply and quickly. Moreover, it contributed to academic improvement by raising the academic performance of middle and lower-tier students. I believe equalization thus performed its role admirably in the industrial age, the era of small-variety mass production.\\n\\nHowever, since the 1990s, our society has been rapidly changing from an industrial society to a global knowledge-based society. When the world changes, advantages can quickly turn into disadvantages. What about the equalization system?\\n\\nEqualization is a system that standardizes everything. It is difficult to grasp the essence if we understand equalization merely as 'a method of randomly assigning schools by school district.' Equalization standardizes schools, curricula, educational content, educational methods, and also standardizes evaluation and college entrance exams [university admissions]. And if you just follow the standardized manual, no one takes responsibility. Therefore, it contrasts with liberal education that 'makes everyone act and move' and whose results are transparently revealed.\\n\\nThe equalization system is like a planned economy and collusion between politics and business in education. Under a planned economy and political-business collusion, there is no need to make efforts to foster creativity. It is more advantageous to collude with power than to engage in technology development or management innovation. Similarly, under equalization, principals make efforts to establish good relationships with the education office to receive more budget rather than specializing their schools.\\n\\nTeachers focus on applying already standardized textbooks rather than developing specialized textbooks by paying attention to regional and student characteristics. Students cannot choose schools that develop their aptitudes or talents and have no choice but to seek school districts with good educational environments.\\n\\nEqualization is actually lowering educational equity. Equalization has created prestigious school districts as a byproduct. National 'education special zones' such as Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] are difficult to enter unless you are wealthy. Moreover, the wealthy somehow compensate for educational losses due to equalization through hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry].\\n\\nAs a result, equalization strengthens the entrenchment of social classes through education. We find in equalization the same reason why the current government's aim for real estate price stability failed miserably as a result of ignoring market principles.\\n\\nEducation is a matter of concern for all citizens. And citizens' educational needs are diverse. There are many citizens who want equalization, and there are also many who oppose equalization and want modification. Therefore, what the government should do is guarantee diverse educational choice rights so that no class feels alienated from the nation and society.\\n\\nTherefore, the more diverse schools are, the better. Also, the more specialized and professionalized education becomes, the better. For citizens who want equalization, equalization schools should also be established. And schools that select through school-specific exams, or schools that select without exams, etc., should also be guaranteed. Liberal education that 'makes students and teachers act and move' should naturally be recognized.\\n\\nWouldn't it be desirable for 21st-century education to be prepared by free private sectors pursuing creativity and excellence rather than by the state pursuing fairness and equity?\\n\\nLee Myung-hee, Professor at Kongju National University, History Education\\n\\n▼Return to Uniform Entrance Exam Education▼\\n\\nMore than 98% of middle school graduates advance to high school. About 80% of high school graduates advance to university. This is a very different situation from when Seoul National University President Jung Woon-chan attended middle and high school.\\n\\nWhile having lunch with two teachers who graduated from Seoul National University, we discussed President Jung's argument for the need to reconsider high school equalization. One of them said that when attending middle and high school, he never sat beyond the third row from the front. When he went for teaching practice in his senior year of university and observed classes from the back of the classroom, the classroom viewed from there was truly a 'new world' and was quite shocking.\\n\\nThe other teacher graduated from a science high school and entered Seoul National University. That teacher said there was no great need to study during the first and second years after admission. This was because there were no educational programs to continue the in-depth education from high school.\\n\\nPresident Jung's talk of reconsidering equalization is not new. He has made similar arguments several times in other venues. When encountering the logic underlying his statements, I get the feeling that he 'cannot escape the limitations of generational perception.' It is a limitation of perception that mistakes the educational form of that era, when only a few academically excellent students could have educational opportunities, as the best education. The closed thinking that 'only academically excellent students are elite' is frightening.\\n\\nIt also seems to mock the educational reform movement that has sought to overcome forcing uniform entrance exam education on individual students with different special skills, aptitudes, interests, and concerns. The harm of uniform entrance exam education still exists severely, as seen in the 'new world of the back rows of the classroom.'\\n\\nThere is talk of gifted individuals who can support 50,000-100,000 people, but I don't want to be supported in that way. Also, what would be the feelings of the 50,000-100,000 people who have fallen into being supported? What if that gifted person has no intention of using their abilities for our society's members? What is the recent wave of nationality renunciations telling us?\\n\\nMore important than giftedness is the process by which gifted individuals are nurtured. We need 'gifted individuals with human faces' who go through popular and democratic processes and know how to cherish communal values. Gifted individuals who are not like this may become absorbed only in pursuing private interests without using their excellent abilities for public benefit. Let's not force education that only looks forward in the classroom. Students should be able to look to the side, look behind, and think about outside the classroom. Shouldn't we cultivate intellectuals rather than knowledge technicians?\\n\\nPresident Jung should first worry about Seoul National University's reality of providing the same curriculum to students who received early gifted education at special purpose high schools and general high school graduates, and Seoul National University's incompetence in distorting high school equalization as averaging of results while failing to provide appropriate specialized education to students who received selective education. This is the task he must fundamentally solve.\\n\\nIs selection the problem, or is universities' educational capacity the problem? Wouldn't it be right to expand the discussion focused on selection toward worrying about improving the educational capacity of schools at all levels?\\n\\nKim Young-sam, Teacher at Daesin High School, Seoul\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4824, "output_tokens": 1723, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Of these two objectives, at least one—reducing the burden of hagwon education costs—has failed. This is because hagwon attendance among first-year high school students has increased even more in order to survive the intensified competition for school records, and Seoul National University's admissions policy of introducing integrated essay exams due to the weakened discriminatory power of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] and school records is causing turmoil in the hagwon education market for integrated essay preparation.\\n\\nThe education authorities' alternative is to research making essay-writing a formal curriculum subject. Among 161 four-year universities nationwide, only 40-50 universities conduct essay exams and in-depth interviews, yet they plan to teach essay-writing to all students. This sounds like a declaration that the government will activate essay-writing hagwon education. Ultimately, the '2008 Academic Year College Admission Improvement Plan' has brought unprecedented hagwon education cost burdens to parents and is only adding to the anxiety of students and parents.\\n\\nYet the ruling government party, rather than thinking to supplement the flawed parts of the college admission improvement plan, is misleading the essence by driving public opinion that 'Seoul National University's integrated curriculum essay exam is nothing but a college-specific entrance exam.' However, Seoul National University appears to have no intention of yielding to the authorities' pressure, and with the arrival of summer vacation, the essay-writing hagwon education market is crying out with joy from the influx of students.\\n\\nEducation authorities must readjust the college admission improvement plan.

There are only study methods that fit your own style. Kim Hyeon-su (19, Seoul National University College of Social Sciences), who passed Seoul National University's regular admissions, and Yeon Seon-mo (19, Korea University School of Law), who passed Korea University's early admissions. The two prepared for essay-writing exams in completely different ways, but both passed with high scores. If Kim is a 'fundamentals type' who honed his essay-writing skills through reading and building current affairs knowledge, Yeon is a 'practical type' who wrote as if engaging in real combat, tailored to the question patterns of his target university. Let's examine these two students' essay-writing study methods.\\\"\\n\\n○ Fundamentals Type\\n\\\"Many high school students think 'it's too late to start reading books now,' but that's absolutely not true. Half the books I read were during high school.\\\"\\n\\nKim Hyeon-su, who passed Seoul National University's regular admissions, said that steady book reading was the secret to high scores on essay-writing exams. The dormitory at Pohang Youngsin High School in North Gyeongsang Province, where he attended, didn't have a single TV. With only books to turn to, he read about one book every two days.\\n\\nIn his first and second years of high school, he was even scolded by teachers for reading books during self-study time. Though he read countless books, he never touched the so-called 'essay-writing classics' that people say are 'good to read for essay-writing exam preparation.' From the beginning, he had abandoned the purpose of 'essay-writing exam preparation' and simply immersed himself in novels he enjoyed. He even read the 10-volume epic novel 'Taebaek Mountains' in hushed silence during self-study time.\\n\\n\\\"Even without reading difficult classics, reading books itself helps with essay-writing exams. Through reading, I became able to read passages quickly and accurately, and my background knowledge increased.\\\"\\n\\nKim read newspapers and current affairs weekly magazines without missing a single day. During every break between classes, he diligently read two newspapers and current affairs weeklies. When writing his Seoul National University regular admissions essay-writing exam answer, he also utilized cases he had read in newspapers. The question was 'Write about methods to respect minority opinions even within the principle of majority rule.' He happened to recall an article about conflicts between the government and local governments over the installation of nuclear waste disposal facilities. He wrote a concrete answer: 'Government compensation money can simultaneously solve environmental problems and resident welfare in the relevant area.'\\n\\n\\\"What's important in essay-writing exams is having a solid personal value system. Don't unconditionally memorize and write background knowledge, or show off with tricks like stuffing your writing full of flowery language. Learn to think for yourself through books and newspapers.\\\"\\n\\n○ Practical Type\\n\\nYeon Seon-mo, who passed Korea University's second-semester early admissions, is a case of competing through university-specific customized practice with past exam questions. Each university presents sample essay-writing exam questions every year, and the actual questions don't deviate from these sample question types.\\n\\nYeon first analyzed what question types appeared in Korea University's sample questions. Then he systematically found past exam questions from various universities similar to those question types. By solving past exam questions as if taking actual exams, he was able to prepare for essay-writing exams in a short time.\\n\\n\\\"When I examined Korea University's early admissions essay-writing sample questions, there were three question types: △summary questions △questions interpreting poetry or novels in relation to passages △chart interpretation questions. After that, I found and solved only questions corresponding to each question type. Practicing this way, I could more clearly understand what kind of answers Korea University wanted, and in the actual exam, the question types looked familiar so I could easily structure my answers.\\\"\\n\\nAfter solving past exam questions, he received one-on-one face-to-face corrections from a hagwon instructor. He heard explanations like 'this expression is good or bad' from the instructor, or learned new approaches like 'other students wrote it this way.'

Are there no additional measures?\\\"\\n\\nVarious government ministry officials gathered that day to hold the '1st Task Force (TF) Meeting for Stabilizing Public Livelihoods' to curb soaring prices, but the results were disappointing. Most were rehashes of recently announced measures. There were many overlaps with the 'Measures to Stabilize Public Livelihoods and Support Micro Self-Employed and Small Business Owners' that the Ministry of Economy and Finance had announced at the same location two days earlier on the 3rd.\\n\\nIncluding a rice ramen supply pilot project of unknown commercialization timeline as a price control measure item, or saying \\\"we will prevent public utility rate increases during the first half of the year\\\" when administrative fees (central public rates) and garbage bag prices (local public rates) had already risen at the beginning of the year, was close to being forced.\\n\\nDirect regulatory measures reminiscent of the '5th Republic era' such as strengthening crackdowns on hoarding and cornering, operating joint price inspection teams led by the National Tax Service, local governments, and consumer groups, and operating 'perceived hagwon fee monitoring teams' led by parents and teachers were pitiful. Ko Young-sun, director of the Fiscal and Social Development Research Department at the Korea Development Institute (KDI), said \\\"Such crackdowns disappeared in the mid-1990s and we no longer have the administrative capacity to handle them\\\" and \\\"they will be ineffective.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, when asked back 'is there an alternative?', it's not easy to answer. Inflation is usually controlled through monetary tightening, import liberalization, expanded supply of stockpiled materials, etc., but none of these methods work against price increases caused by recent surges in international raw material prices for oil, grains, etc. There are virtually no effective policy tools available.\\n\\nDirector Lim lamented that \\\"the range of prices the government can control is only 16%.\\\" This meant that since public utility rates account for 16% of overall prices, the government can only intervene in exactly that much.\\n\\nRaw material prices are unlikely to fall for some time to come. In the end, only 'ultra-long-term measures' such as consumption conservation for scarce raw materials and improved utilization efficiency remain, but this is the responsibility of households and businesses, not the government. For example, businesses should quickly transform our still 'energy-intensive' industrial structure into a high-value-added one, and households should participate in conservation campaigns recommended by the Energy Citizens' Coalition (www.100.com).\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2661, "output_tokens": 699, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Among these, essay writing might be somewhat neglected since most test-takers have experience preparing for it during their college entrance exam period.\\n\\nOf course, the basic nature of college entrance essays and LEET essays is the same. However, since the level of test-takers is different, superior thinking ability is required.\\n\\nLaw school admissions experts advise that LEET essays differ from college entrance essays in many aspects, so they should never be taken lightly.\\n\\nCollege entrance essays and LEET essays have different weights in their respective exams. In the case of college entrance essays, they have absolute influence in early admission but relatively low weight compared to CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) in regular admission.\\n\\nHowever, essay writing, which is one of the three subjects in LEET, occupies a very large portion within LEET. Since 3-4 questions are given, if even one question is poorly answered, dozens of points are deducted from the raw score of 100 points. Additionally, many universities plan to conduct additional essays in university-specific exams. Most of these universities allocate 20-30% of the total score to additional essays. It can be said that essays are virtually the key to success or failure. Furthermore, evaluation items such as personal statements, interviews, and oral exams cannot receive good evaluations without the logical thinking, reasoning ability, and background knowledge that form the basis of essay writing.\\n\\nSecond, the direction required by essay topics and the nature of provided texts differ. Analyzing recent college entrance essay trends, most formats present various materials and current social problems, requiring analysis of problems and presentation of solutions. However, LEET essays require analytical understanding, critical evaluation, and creative application. However, in second-round essays that may be conducted by individual universities, integrated essays like college entrance exams are likely to be presented, but the content and direction of passages are judged to be quite different from college entrance essays.\\n\\nThird, the difficulty level of essays and the intellectual level of test-takers differ. College entrance essays, even if students have received deep education from the basics of essay writing, can only present high school-level topics. Also, while there may be outstanding students among test-takers, overall they inevitably lack social experience, complex thinking ability, and understanding of general education. However, admission to law schools that train legal professionals must be very different. First, the difficulty level of provided texts is remarkably high, centered on classical works, and good grades cannot be expected without deep understanding of the background.\\n\\nAlso, the academic background and career experience of law school applicants, with each university selecting 50-150 students, are expected to be at a considerable level. Therefore, it seems difficult to pass with ordinary-level essay writing skills.\\n\\nWhile there are many test-takers interested in law school, the reality is that materials or information that can resolve their curiosities are still severely insufficient. It is also true that short-term self-study methods make it difficult to expect good results. Although there will be various difficulties, deep learning and efforts for discussion are necessary to enjoy the glory of admission. Along with continuous effort, it is essential to receive help from those with professional knowledge and acquire sufficient knowledge and understanding necessary for LEET and interviews.\\n\\nLee Cheong, PLS Essay hagwon instructor\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3239, "output_tokens": 872, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Those kids don't lend out their notes easily during exam time.\\\" Park Yeon-tak, a 3rd-year student at Seoul Sindong Middle School preparing for foreign language high school entrance exams, is curious about top students' note-taking know-how. During exam periods, these students' notes enjoy higher popularity than certain reference books. There's something special about their notes. Jo Won-ik, director of Cheongseol Hagwon Junggye Main Branch, says \\\"Top students have their own notes that they reorganize at home every day, separate from the notes they take during class.\\\" These notes serve as both 'comprehensive notes' that supplement class content with reference books and internet resources, and 'wrong-answer notes' where they record and check parts they don't understand. A characteristic of these students is that they organize their notes using various writing tools in diverse ways. Let's steal a peek at top students' note-taking strategies.」\\n\\n○ Strategy 1: Manage your own 'dual notes'\\nJo Ha-eun, a 2nd-year student at Seoul Seomun Girls' Middle School who ranks 2nd or 3rd in her school, manages 'dual notes' at home every day. During class, she quickly jots down as much as possible of what the teacher explains on scratch paper, and when she gets home, she adds content from reference books for each subject or English grammar books to what's written on the scratch paper, organizing it into 'comprehensive notes'.\\n\\nThe teacher's explanations help when marking important parts likely to appear on exams, while reference book content helps understand the overall flow. However, she rewrites everything in her own words so it's easy to understand even when reading later. Jo says, \\\"Sometimes it's bothersome to do this every day, but once you get used to it, organizing notes only takes 40-50 minutes per day.\\\"\\n\\nNote-taking isn't only necessary for review. Lee Ho-yeon, a 3rd-year student at Seoul Jangseung Middle School who never loses her position as top student, also organizes notes when preparing for class. In Lee's Korean history notes, textbook key points are summarized in black. Newly learned historical facts are written in purple, and parts she wants to learn more about are written in blue. Colors become indicators for studying. Lee says, \\\"If I organize my notes in advance, it helps because I can listen more carefully to parts I'm curious about during class.\\\"\\n\\n○ Strategy 2: Use as 'wrong-answer notes' to memo parts you don't understand\\nComprehensive notes also serve as 'wrong-answer notes.' When Lee Ho-yeon, a 3rd-year student at Seoul Jangseung Middle School, organizes her notes, she writes 'Why?' in blue letters next to parts she doesn't understand. When the number of question marks increases, she looks up all the answers at once. Once she finds the answers, she writes the reasons next to the 'Why?' for future reference. She usually asks teachers or looks things up in reference books or on the internet to resolve her questions.\\n\\nKim Min-ji, a 2nd-year student at Seoul Nowon High School who ranks in the top 10% of her school, always marks parts she doesn't understand with a 'V' when taking notes and folds the corresponding page. This is so she can find the teacher the next day to ask questions. Once she learns the answer, she changes the mark to '○' to indicate the problem has been resolved. Kim reads her notes so frequently that she says, \\\"I read my notes for fun whenever I'm bored.\\\" She explained that carrying her notes during break time, lunch time, and even when going to the bathroom and reading them in spare moments helps her check parts she doesn't understand and ask questions.\\n\\n○ Strategy 3: Armed with various writing tools\\nThe notes written by all three students are colorfully rainbow-hued. They're decorated with various colored pens, highlighters, colored pencils, mechanical pencils, and Post-it notes. While they might seem chaotic, they're actually more orderly and easier to read than notes written with just one mechanical pencil. This is thanks to having clear principles established. \\\"The most important thing is pen colors. I set rules for which colors to use for which parts, and I absolutely never change the colors.\\\" (2nd-year student Kim Min-ji)\\n\\nKim's pencil case always contains a three-color pen bundling blue, red, and green, highlighters, colored pencils, and small Post-it notes. She uses red for parts the teacher said would be on the exam, blue for teacher explanations, and green for parts where she summarized textbook content herself - for underlining or writing. Post-it notes are attached to parts that are hard to understand when preparing for or reviewing classes with textbooks, and highlighters are used to quickly underline important words in literature classes.\\n\\n\\\"Don't write everything cramped together with a pencil because you're afraid to waste the notebook - if you take notes drawing pictures with various colored pens, it becomes like a diary that you won't get tired of reading over and over again.\\\"\\n\\nThis is Kim's secret to improving her skills while putting effort into decorating her notes.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4331, "output_tokens": 1635, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Using the letters of the word CHANGE, I'll divide this into upper and lower sections.\\n[Upper]\\nC: Confidence\\nH: Health\\nA: Attitude\\n[Lower]\\nN: New\\nG: Goal\\nE: Emotion\\n○C: Confidence\\nStudents facing a new environment might become discouraged and turn passive. Middle school isn't that different from elementary school. It's just the same school, only now there are different teachers for each subject and more subjects to learn.\\nAs subjects increase, the amount of studying also increases. Many students become afraid or lose confidence at this time. This is precisely when the spirit of 'I CAN DO IT' is needed. Parents should share their own past experiences and tell their children \\\"You can do it\\\" or \\\"It's nothing at all\\\" to instill confidence in their child.\\n○H: Health\\nToday's children have grown bigger in size but their physical strength has greatly declined. In the past, only high school seniors were called test-takers and forced to study tremendous amounts, but nowadays even middle school third-graders carry the label of test-takers. Particularly to enter high schools with excellent college admission records like specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools, students must digest study loads comparable to high school seniors.\\nTo take the increasingly competitive specialized high school entrance exams each year, building physical strength is important. Regular exercise is necessary not just for studying but for lifelong health. Recently, a middle school PE teacher said, \\\"When today's kids do performance assessments [school-based assessments, not standardized exams] rolling on mats during PE class, surprisingly many students can't control their bodies properly and can't roll.\\\" Physical strength is academic ability. Secure regular exercise time.\\n○A: Attitude\\nYou'll meet not only homeroom teachers but teachers from various subjects. Nowadays there are performance assessments [school-based assessments, not standardized exams]. These are tests where teachers evaluate students' performance in subjects. This evaluation can hardly completely exclude the teacher's subjectivity. Giving a bad impression won't benefit you at all.\\nThere are several ways to make a good impression. First, always live with a smile. As the saying goes, 'You can't spit on a smiling face' - a smile is a powerful weapon for making good impressions. Second, always maintain a respectful attitude. If you always greet politely when arriving at school or encountering teachers in hallways, you're bound to give a good feeling. Third, even if you can't do tremendously well in all aspects of school life like studying, homework, and cleaning, always show a sincere effort. Making a good impression must start from very small things.\\nYoon Sang-young, Director of 7th Grade, Youngjae Military Academy Hagwon\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2830, "output_tokens": 677, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Jung Hyun-chang (photo), an 08 freshman at Kyung Hee University's College of Korean Medicine, whom we met at the '2nd Sky Edu Scholarship Recipients' awards ceremony held on February 27th, says he acquired his own secrets through three CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] attempts.\\n\\n○ Why I absolutely had to go to that university\\nI became interested in Korean medicine after seeing Dr. Lee Kyung-je on television. I fell in love with this fascinating field of study that treats illness by accepting the laws of nature. But after one failure, I began retaking [the exam]. I was admitted to a Korean medicine college in a rural area, but the excitement was short-lived. The research facilities and school programs were insufficient to satisfy my passion. Then I had the opportunity to attend a special lecture by Professor Park Jong-bae of Kyung Hee University, and I set the goal of studying at Korea's top Korean medicine college, choosing the path of a repeat test-taker [a student retaking CSAT after high school graduation] for what would be my fourth attempt by count.\\n\\n○ I studied with famous instructors while living in the provinces\\nLooking for a way to compete with Seoul students while living in the provinces, I chose online lectures. Having been particularly interested in science, I had been taking Teacher Choi Jeong-yun's lectures since high school and became absorbed in fascinating science stories. For this exam, I studied centered on online lectures, and this can be said to be my secret to success.\\nOnline lectures are more effective because you can study by setting your own study plan without being tied to hagwon [Korean private academy] schedules. They would also be good teachers for students who feel economic burden.\\n\\n○ How to sleep well and play well: the basics for test-takers\\nMy strategy was to sleep sufficiently and concentrate while awake. When study time gets longer, efficiency inevitably drops. People say college entrance preparation is a battle of time. But the competitiveness I believe in is stamina. While preparing for CSAT, I didn't eat any special health foods. Eating well and sleeping well just like in normal life was my own secret that allowed me to study with concentration.\\n\\n○ Those who play alone go to college alone\\nLooking at high school seniors and repeat test-takers [students retaking CSAT after high school graduation], after taking mock exams, they sometimes play for a day or two to relieve stress. But such temptations are addictive and can even lead to doubts like 'Why do I have to study so hard?' My own method for overcoming stress is 'playing alone.' After taking mock exams, I would play games at home or even go to karaoke alone.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2749, "output_tokens": 710, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Because it means losing myself.\\nGenerally, the cause of dementia is known to be a toxic substance called 'beta (β)-amyloid protein.' Another dementia-causing substance discovered by Professor Seo Yu-heon of Seoul National University College of Medicine in the late 1990s is 'C-terminal protein,' which is 10 times more toxic. We can think that when these toxic substances accumulate in large amounts in the brain, brain cells are destroyed and eventually dementia occurs.\\nWhen I wrote an article titled <How to Prepare Well for Old Age> in the last issue, many people said:\\n\\\"I don't have money to put into a pension. It's hard enough paying for my kids' hagwon fees.\\\"\\nSome people also said:\\n\\\"Shouldn't you focus on good financial investments rather than pensions?\\\"\\nI agree quite a bit with the opinions of people who say these things. However, for those who worry about old age but don't think about pensions at all, I'd like to share a story mentioned in a book I recently read called 'Lectures on Wealth (by Lee Young-ju).'\\nThere was Grandmother A who had 1 billion won [approximately $750,000 USD] in cash excluding her house and no pension, and Grandmother B who received 5 million won [approximately $3,750 USD] monthly through various pensions. Grandmother A lived very comfortably by gradually using her 1 billion won plus interest, and Grandmother B also lived comfortably receiving her pension.\\nBut suddenly both grandmothers developed dementia. The children of both grandmothers sent their grandmothers to live in nursing homes. Treatment costs were covered by the grandmothers' assets or pensions. As time passed, the children's thoughts gradually changed.\\nGrandmother A's children became anxious seeing the principal amount gradually decrease. This was because the inheritance they would receive was shrinking. Before they knew it, instead of 'mother,' they increasingly used the phrase 'that old woman,' and though they didn't say it out loud, the thought 'why doesn't she just pass away' grew stronger.\\nGrandmother B's children used half of the pension for treatment costs and half for their grandchildren's hagwon fees and mortgage interest. They always say \\\"She should live a long life.\\\" This is because the pension stops when grandmother passes away.\\nI also agree with the criticism that this is too extreme a story. Surely not—our lovely and devoted children wouldn't do such things... Moreover, according to scientists' forecasts, dementia medication will be available within 10 years at the earliest, or within 20 years at the latest, so we can feel reassured.\\nHowever, a pension is a means to live proudly in front of your children even after age 65. If you've prepared your pension well, it's like having a job where you can work for life until you die.\\nHow about receiving your salary from your pension and devoting your actual work to volunteer activities or hobbies you want to do?

Also, unlike last year when students had to perform well across all areas, this year it appears that high scores in certain subjects can compensate for weaker subjects.\\nKim Hee-dong, director of the admissions analysis division at Jinhak Corporation, said, \\\"Most top-tier universities in early admission set minimum academic standards within grades 1-2 for two areas, so students cannot neglect CSAT preparation,\\\" adding, \\\"Students must be familiar with their target universities' minimum academic standards, subject-specific weightings, and CSAT priority selection criteria.\\\"\\n▽Selection through school records and essays=As early admission quotas have increased, admission tracks that select students based solely on school records and essays or that introduce admissions officer systems have expanded.\\nKorea University, Yonsei University, and Sungkyunkwan University's early admission second-semester general tracks place heavy emphasis on essays. Although most universities have abolished essays in regular admission, they still use essays in early admission, so mid-to-upper tier students should not neglect essay preparation.\\nKyung Hee University's Outstanding Academic Performance II, Sookmyung Women's University's Major Aptitude Excellence, and Sungkyunkwan University's Academic Excellence tracks select new students based solely on school record grades. Students must carefully examine the reflection ratios of curricular and extracurricular grades in school records, point differences between grades, and subjects reflected.\\nAlso, students with special talents in mathematics, science, and foreign languages should pay attention to special talent tracks such as Korea University's Science Gifted track or Ewha Womans University's Future Scientist track. Test-takers applying to tracks utilizing admissions officer systems, such as Kyung Hee University's NeoRenaissance track or Chung-Ang University's Da Vinci Talented Individual track, need admission strategies that leverage their strengths.\\n▽Focus on departments related to professional graduate schools=Starting from the 2009 academic year, law schools will be introduced and medical graduate schools will increase, so top-tier students aiming for law and medical colleges are expected to flock to adjacent departments, raising admission cutoff scores.\\nFifteen universities in the Seoul region and ten regional universities have received approval to establish law schools and cannot recruit new law students starting from this admission cycle. Accordingly, top-tier test-takers are expected to flock to adjacent departments such as business administration and political science, likely raising competition rates and admission cutoff scores.\\nAlso, as some medical colleges including Catholic University convert to graduate schools, medical college quotas will decrease, potentially raising competition rates for medical colleges that have not yet converted as well as departments like biology and chemistry.\\nLee Man-ki, evaluation director at Uway Jungang Education, said, \\\"Pharmacy colleges are also extending their curriculum to six years and introducing a system requiring students to complete another major before specializing in pharmacy, which is expected to increase competition rates for adjacent departments,\\\" adding, \\\"Test-takers planning to major in medicine and pharmacy should prepare by understanding in advance the area-specific weightings of adjacent departments.\\\"\\nReporter Choi Chang-bong ceric@donga.com\\n\\n[Table content follows listing universities by admission groups 'A', 'B', 'C' and various admission criteria percentages - extensive detailed tables with university names and percentage breakdowns for different admission factors like CSAT scores, essays, school records, and interviews]\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8861, "output_tokens": 1031, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

According to a New York Times report on the 6th, at the City University of New York, the number of philosophy majors has reached 322 students, a 50% increase from six years ago. When analyzing LSAT (Law School Admission Test) scores taken by American law school applicants, students who majored in philosophy as undergraduates had the second-highest average scores overall. First place went to physics majors.\\n▷The LSAT is the representative test for measuring logical and analytical thinking abilities in the United States. This newly confirms the fact that studying philosophy is perfectly suited for developing such capabilities. American college students favor studying philosophy not only for the practical reason that it's advantageous for law school admission, but also as a 'compass' to navigate an uncertain future. The 'Top Leader Humanities Program' established by Seoul National University's College of Liberal Arts last year achieved unexpected success for the same reason. The CEOs who enrolled in this program said they gained management wisdom by attending lectures on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.\\n▷The 'revival of philosophy' movement is also being detected in Korea's university admissions. This year's admissions saw rising competition rates for philosophy departments at top-tier universities. University officials point out that this is not unrelated to the opening of law schools in March next year. With the opening of law schools, law departments will disappear, and in this case, many students think that majoring in philosophy would be advantageous for law school admission after graduation. Whatever the reason, this is a welcome development.\\n▷At the end of July, the 22nd World Philosophy Congress, called the 'Philosophy Olympics,' will be held in Seoul. Established in 1900 and previously held only in European cultural regions, this is the first time the congress is being held in a non-European region. The theme is 'Rethinking Philosophy Today.' Philosophy is the 'classic of learning' containing humanity's long-standing wisdom, but today it faces a crisis to the extent that it 'must be rethought.' However, strictly speaking, philosophy has always been in the same place—perhaps modern people, swept up by trends, simply failed to recognize its true value. Philosophy's vitality will be eternal as long as humans don't give up being 'thinking animals.' I hope that Korea, using the World Philosophy Congress as an opportunity, will become a cultural hub leading the way in 'reconsidering philosophy.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2634, "output_tokens": 586, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Recognized for these results, he was accepted to Columbia University's College of Natural Sciences and UC Berkeley.\\n\\nKang's research topic was that animals and plants emit light of a specific intensity due to life activities, and when moisture decreases, this light shows consistent changes.\\n\\nStarting in 2006 during his second year at the science academy, he conducted repeated experiments with over 1,000 rose leaves and discovered the phenomenon where light briefly intensifies and then weakens again as leaves dry. He published this in the Journal of Korean Physical Society, an SCI academic journal published by the Korean Physical Society, in January this year.\\n\\nThe academic community views these research results as potentially useful for measuring food spoilage timing and expiration dates, and applicable to criminal investigations.\\n\\nKang attended elementary and middle school in Wonju, Gangwon [a province in northeastern South Korea], and entered the science academy early after finishing his second year of middle school. Having been absorbed in science learning comics since childhood, he would go to nearby mountains with friends after school to observe plants and insects, fostering his interest in physics and biology.\\n\\nHe said, \\\"I had much curiosity about natural phenomena, but never received hagwon education to enter the science academy,\\\" adding \\\"I always practiced thinking about all natural phenomena from different angles.\\\"\\n\\nAfter spending a year in America during first grade following his professor father, he also studied English diligently.\\n\\nBased on this English ability, he participated in an international academic conference held at the University of Bath in the UK last September, where he directly explained his paper to professors and answered questions.\\n\\nKang, who entered KAIST this year, was selected for Columbia University's 'Rabi Scholar Program' and is scheduled to enter in September.\\n\\nCreated to commemorate Professor Isidor Isaac Rabi, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944, this program annually provides in-depth research opportunities from undergraduate years to scientists with outstanding talents in the top 1% (10 students) among approximately 1,000 science major incoming students.\\n\\nStudents selected for this program receive research and dormitory fee support for four years and can be assigned special supervising professors when desired to participate in experiments and paper writing with campus research teams.\\n\\nKang said, \\\"I want to combine physics and biology to conduct various research related to real life,\\\" adding \\\"Having studied with national support at the science academy, I want to become a scientist who repays the country.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4450, "output_tokens": 1602, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It measures logical thinking ability and creative problem-solving skills among approximately 300 document screening passers.\\nThe entire middle school curriculum is the test scope, and integrated interdisciplinary problems are given. The principle is to present questions in Korean and answer in Korean. However, when necessary, answers can be written in English for problems with Korean reading materials.\\nSubjects are organized as △1st period: Language and Social Studies, 60 minutes each △2nd period: Mathematics and Science, 60 minutes each. All subject problems are presented as subjective questions including short answer, descriptive, and essay types. The number of questions varies each year.\\n○Study Preparation for Gifted Student Assessment Test\\nQuestion types change every year. For 1st and 2nd year middle school students, learning that can develop thinking and logical skills is needed rather than simple rote memorization. It helps to acquire various background knowledge related to subjects.\\nThe 1st period Language and Social Studies presents problems that utilize diverse reading experiences based on understanding of middle school Korean, Social Studies, and Ethics subject content. For Social Studies subjects, problems requiring description and essay writing using background knowledge of current affairs are presented, either integrated with Ethics subject content or interdisciplinary. Therefore, students must develop the ability to accurately understand presented texts and write various essays of approximately 400, 800, and 1200 characters while utilizing background knowledge.\\nLanguage also presents literature problems. Rather than asking for partial understanding of works, it requires appreciation ability for entire works. Problems requiring creation of works according to several given conditions, or re-creating works that match provided commentary have also been presented. Basic knowledge necessary for literary creation must be possessed.\\nFor 2nd period Mathematics and Science, it's good to carefully review past question types. While the 1st period has many problems outside the curriculum, the 2nd period has many problems based on subject knowledge.\\nFor the Mathematics section, it's good to prepare for the Gifted Student Assessment Test simultaneously while preparing for math competitions. From lower grades, it's necessary to consistently practice logical development processes in preparation for descriptive problems. Students should organize solution processes well through error notebooks for even simple problems in daily practice. Effective preparation requires practicing various problem types including in-depth learning of the entire middle school curriculum, creative thinking problems of various types, and Olympiad problems applying middle school curriculum.\\nFor the Science section, it's important to clearly understand basic concepts in the four areas of physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science within the middle school curriculum. If possible, studying up to the common science level is sufficient. Don't end with understanding subject knowledge, but check scientific phenomena based on concepts and principles. From lower grades, it's necessary to learn various scientific phenomena and common knowledge related to daily life through science-related reading. Subscribing to science magazines and building broad background knowledge helps with university entrance essay preparation in the long term. In terms of question composition, physics and chemistry-related problems have high weight.\\n[In-Depth Interview]\\nIn last year's admissions, the in-depth interview was a type that checked the ability to logically explain one's thoughts rather than asking about subject abilities, and had a strong character interview nature. Particularly, since there are questions based on application content, it's necessary to carefully review the content written in the application.\\nThe interview format is generally 10-20 minutes per person. One-on-one or three-on-one interviews are common. Since Minjok Leadership Academy teachers divide and take charge of interviewing students, question attitudes and reactions to answers may differ depending on the teacher. Therefore, it's necessary to carefully understand the interviewer's question intent and then clearly present one's thoughts with a confident attitude.\\n※In-Depth Interview Past Questions\\n2008 Character Interview Topics\\n1. If problems occur with friends during dormitory life, what would you do? Answer in English.\\n2. Describe how you lived during your foreign study abroad experience and mention the good and not-so-good points.\\n3. Answer in English whether you will attend university in Korea or abroad.\\n4.

His eldest child was entering middle school, and he felt it would be difficult to receive proper college entrance exam education in his area, so wouldn't it be better to move to Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] before it was too late? In fact, there are probably very few parents who are free from this kind of concern related to their children's college admission. This is because they believe that entering prestigious universities and popular majors will have a very significant impact on their children's future. They think the difference in results is significant depending on what kind of environment one receives education in. Let's consider this problem from the perspective of 'Can educational equality be realized?'\\n\\n\\\"The functionalist perspective holds that subsystems, which are partial elements that make up society, perform functions that integrate society as a whole and maintain order. For example, families, religions, schools, the military, etc. that constitute society form a patterned structure, and these structures are seen as performing functions necessary to maintain and integrate society as a whole. In other words, it assumes that the partial elements constituting the entire society form a well-integrated structure and function to maintain social order through mutual interaction.\\\" [High School Social Studies Textbook]\\n\\n○ In the Textbook... ① Structural Functionalism\\n\\nFrom a functionalist perspective, education contributes to social stability and integration. Schools transmit the skills, knowledge, and community consciousness that society demands. It is said that school education can play a decisive role in national economic growth and development, as well as human self-realization, through skills training. It is also said that social contradictions can be resolved through school education and social equality can be achieved. Education is seen as capable of resolving social inequality in the sense that it can make life opportunities fair through equalization of educational opportunities.\\n\\nThe high school equalization policy was established with the goal of equalizing educational opportunities. Currently, high school equalization is being implemented in Seoul, the six major metropolitan cities, and 16 other cities. To give all academic high schools, vocational high schools, and special purpose high schools equal opportunities to receive university education, institutional mechanisms such as abolishing high school entrance exams and implementing school record grading systems were prepared. Credit units per subject were determined, and regulations were also placed on the curriculum content taught in schools. This was designed to allow people to change the social and economic status they received from their parents at birth according to their own abilities through educational equality. In other words, it can be seen as providing opportunities for class mobility through education.\\n\\n○ In the Textbook... ② Conflict Theory\\n\\nHowever, can these policy efforts realize the social integrative goal of alleviating social conflict through equalization of educational opportunities? Let's look at the following perspective.\\n\\n\\\"The reason social conflict exists is because resources that social members want to possess, such as economic wealth, political power, and social prestige, are scarce, and parts with different interests form conflicting relationships with each other, and as conflict intensifies, society changes. From a conflict theory perspective, social structure is a structure of dominance and subordination relationships based on unequal distribution of social resources, and therefore a structure that induces conflict between components.\\\" [High School Social Studies Textbook]\\n\\nFrom a conflict theory perspective, education solidifies the existing social hierarchy and produces relationships of dominance and subordination. In other words, schools perpetuate social inequality by reproducing the existing order. The ideal of equity in educational opportunities is also merely formal. In reality, educational opportunities are inevitably given differentially according to parents' economic power, and this appears as differences in university admission rates. Viewed this way, education, which seems to be a bastion of equality in our society, actually plays a role in reproducing social inequality structures.\\n\\nThe following research results announced by Seoul National University's Institute for Social Sciences in 2005 support this fact (research subjects: Seoul National University College of Social Sciences admissions from 1970 to 2003):\\n\\n\\\"...The admission rate of children of fathers in high-income occupational groups (including executives of general companies) is 20 times higher than the admission rate of other groups, and recently this gap appears to be widening... The admission rate of test-takers with highly educated parents is relatively high, and in particular, the admission rate of test-takers with college-educated parents was estimated to be significantly higher compared to test-takers with high school-educated parents.\\\" [Seoul National University Institute for Social Sciences, 'Who Comes to Seoul National University']\\n\\n○ Shouldn't We Focus Accurately?\\n\\nWhat's important is that education should be able to realize substantial equality to solve problems. The reality where educational services are provided differentially according to income and region must be improved.\\n\\nFirst, normalization of school education is necessary. This means that schools should provide educational services sufficient that students don't need help from hagwon education. Also, schools should develop various learning processes and evaluation methods to provide diverse educational services suited to individual students. Educational equality cannot be achieved by evaluating students with uniform standards. True educational equality is realized when students can compete in their preferred learning environment using the methods they are most confident in.\\n\\nIn the short term, various college admission systems should be established. To alleviate the realistic problem of academic disparities according to income and region, reasonable reverse discrimination measures for educationally marginalized classes are necessary. It is necessary to secure fairness in competition by expanding currently implemented systems such as regional balance admissions, school record-based admissions, and special admissions for people with disabilities.\\n\\nJeon Moon-kyu, Chungsol Aureum Integrated Essay Writing Instructor\\n\\n☞ More detailed reading materials and explanations about functional theory and conflict theory of education can be found on the Easy Essay Writing website (easynonsul.com).\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4384, "output_tokens": 1407, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Local volunteers or university students hoping to become teachers help students with review and problem-solving. The tuition is 5,000 yen [approximately $38 USD] per year. Dotera, which started with 10 students five years ago, now has about 125 participants, roughly one-third of all students, showing its popularity.\\n\\nIn a classroom on the second floor of the north building, nearby university professors and hagwon instructors were conducting English classes. The tuition is 6,000 yen [approximately $46 USD] per month. The first-year course taught by an associate professor from Meisei University has 72 registered students.\\n\\nOn the third floor of the south building, Yoruspe conducted by a hagwon instructor was in full swing. Yoruspe is an abbreviation for 'Night Special,' supplementary classes held after school for top-tier students. Korean and math are taught on weekday evenings, and English on Saturdays. Students are selected through tests and pay about half of hagwon tuition fees.\\n\\nYoruspe has sparked intense pro and con debates in Japan since late last year. On the 24th of last month, 49 residents even filed an injunction application with the Tokyo District Court to stop Yoruspe classes, claiming the school building was being used for profit. However, the school seemed unconcerned.\\n\\n▽Regional Headquarters Nurtures the School = Surprisingly, the Saturday classes, in which 70% of all students participate, are hosted not by the school but by the 'Wada Middle School Regional Headquarters,' composed of parents and local volunteers.\\n\\nThe regional headquarters directly prepares and provides dinner for students on days with evening classes and takes on various tasks such as managing the school grounds' lawn and library.\\n\\nTakaki Hiroko, a regional headquarters committee member, said, \\\"Our role is to allow teachers to focus on their 'main job' of classes and life guidance,\\\" adding, \\\"We've gone through many trials and errors, but it's enjoyable for local residents to gather and create something together.\\\"\\n\\nThe regional headquarters' annual operating budget is about 12 million yen [approximately $91,000 USD]. This is covered by budgets supported by the ward, participation fees, and donations. Saturday class instructors are paid 1,100 yen [approximately $8 USD] as daily wages.\\n\\nWada Middle School's experiment is expected to spread nationwide.\\n\\n▽When Schools Thrive, Communities Thrive = This school ranked first overall among 23 schools in Suginami Ward's academic survey last year. This is the result of efforts to improve study efficiency by introducing a four-semester system instead of the usual three-semester system in Japanese schools and adjusting class time from '28 periods of 50 minutes per week' to '32 periods of 45 minutes per week.'\\n\\nBecause of this, transfer students are also increasing. As of 2007, Wada Middle School had 95 third-year students, 127 second-year students, and 157 first-year students—a pyramid shape with more students in lower grades. Just five years ago, there were only about 70 students per grade, and merger with nearby schools was discussed, but now they are increasing classes.\\n\\nParent Kaneko Sumiyo confided, \\\"When I was transferred from the provinces to Tokyo two years ago, I deliberately moved nearby to enroll my child in this school.\\\"\\n\\nTokyo = Correspondent Seo Young-ah sya@donga.com\\n\\n▼\\\"Starting career education in university is too late... Must begin setting goals from middle school\\\"▼\\n\\n\\\"Until now, Wada Middle School has been driven by individual passion. However, going forward, I want to 'systematize' school operations so that anyone can operate it the same way.\\\"\\n\\nThese were the words of Shirota Akahisa (42, photo), the new principal of Wada Middle School, who looked around classrooms where classes were in full swing with a somewhat excited expression.\\n\\nHe took office less than a month ago and is a former youth career education specialist. He is also a senior-junior colleague relationship with former principal Fujiwara Kazuhiro from the job information company Recruit.\\n\\n\\\"When I was at Recruit, I was in charge of career education for university students, and I keenly felt that this kind of education was too late. I came to think that career education should start at least from middle school to make students set their own goals and work toward them.\\\"\\n\\nAfter leaving Recruit in 2003, he established a company that operates a career education site for middle school students and managed it until last month. He also met Principal Fujiwara at this time.\\n\\nPrincipal Shirota plans to take charge of 'Life Skills,' a unique subject at Wada Middle School, and personally teach about 80 hours annually.\\n\\n\\\"I want students at our school to discover what they want to do for life and find methodology in this class to help them achieve those dreams,\\\" he said.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4114, "output_tokens": 1482, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The previous administration was obsessed with KTU [KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization)] code-based equalization, forcing an entrance exam system that ignored differences between schools and tightly binding schools with regulations that made academic competition difficult. Educational policies that tell leading schools to keep pace with lagging schools can only diminish the competitiveness of future generations. When schools shift from control and instruction-oriented environments to competitive and autonomous atmospheres, competition among schools to improve student performance can develop, leading to overall educational improvement. Rather than 'hagwonization of schools,' we can expect the effect of absorbing learning enthusiasm from hagwon education to public education.\\n\\nSchools now have broad autonomy over zero-period classes before first period, evening self-study sessions, contracted operation of after-school programs, and organizing classes by academic performance. Principals can appropriately utilize such authority to bring many winds of change to schools like corporate CEOs. In Seoul's case, the 'application-first, lottery-second system' will be implemented from 2010, opening an era where parents can choose high schools. According to the Educational Information Disclosure Act enacted last year, all schools must disclose school information such as students' academic achievement levels. Since parents and students will select excellent schools based on disclosed information, principals and school teachers will essentially receive annual evaluations from educational consumers.\\n\\nConcerns from some quarters that this measure might drive schools into merciless entrance exam competition without character education or friendship among students are exaggerated. However, autonomy should proceed within consensus among teachers and parents according to each school's circumstances to avoid problems.\\n\\nWhen education becomes autonomous, schools that fall behind will inevitably emerge.

They agreed to regulate early morning classes (0th period) and ability-based class groupings at frontline schools. The government said to 'enhance educational autonomy,' but their lockstep coordination and their thoughtless prioritization of setting limits on autonomy first reveals the same old practices of being accustomed to external control (他律).\\n\\nEducation offices seem unable to understand the essence of autonomization, perhaps because they have grown accustomed to operating schools only according to government directives. The Ministry of Education abolished 29 administrative guidelines because the government's rigid directives mass-produce 'cookie-cutter education' and run counter to the contemporary trend demanding cultivation of diverse talent—the intent was to break away from cookie-cutter education to fit each school's circumstances.\\n\\nFor example, schools in low-income areas could gather students who have difficulty attending hagwons and provide evening supplementary classes. Schools in areas with better educational conditions could simply choose not to hold 0th period classes if they judge them unnecessary. If schools do not break away from uniform education and transition to level-based education for students, public education will not change. When education office officials uniformly decide 'this is acceptable and that is not' as if holding a resolution rally regarding measures the government produced after much deliberation, there is no room for genuine autonomy to emerge. Do they want to remain bound by Ministry of Education control as in the past?\\n\\nWe are not unaware that education offices' move to regulate 0th period classes and ability groupings also stems from their intent to respond to ideological offensives from left-wing educational organizations. Left-wing groups claim that autonomization will result in 'schools becoming hagwon-ized 24 hours a day and turning into battlefields for college entrance exams.' However, this is a distortion of facts. The Ministry of Education's measures do not universalize ability groupings but rather open the path for more flexible level-based mobile classes across a wider variety of subjects, and 0th period classes are also far from 24-hour hagwon-ization. There are no schools anywhere that would hagwon-ize classrooms 24 hours a day.\\n\\nEducation offices should inform that autonomous education represents an opportunity for individual students to improve their academic ability, and they should confidently counter left-wing groups' distorted agitation by showing exemplary cases of autonomy.

Test-takers think they need to know something in order to prepare answers, and write logically based on that content. They believe diverse background knowledge and creative thinking are important. This common-sense view omits what diverse background knowledge is and how it can be learned, as well as what creative thinking means and how to use it in problem situations. In other words, there are no methods for cultivating various abilities for essay exam learning and no procedures for properly using those abilities. Particularly, many test-takers lose direction in background knowledge learning.\\n○ Knowledge Begins with Background Knowledge\\nLike other essay exams, the most important task in LEET [법학적성시험, Law School Admission Test] essay-writing is analyzing problems and provided texts. However, even good writers will show disharmony in their writing if they lack background knowledge. Even if they grasp what the essay question requires, they will receive low scores if they fail to understand the core of the provided texts. To solve such problems, learning that creates a 'map' through critical thinking of reading comprehension, sentence decoding ability, logical ability, empathy skills, etc. is important. The foundation is built through learning that accurately grasps past exam problems and practices by assuming substitution with different provided texts in response to those problem instructions.\\nAs an example, one can present problems that imply perspectives through provided texts on themes like good and evil, nature versus nurture, determinism and non-determinism, philosophy and science, modernism and postmodernism regarding the theme of human nature. Even if one perspective is resolved, the provided texts that will appear in exams can have various other perspectives. If one acquires deep perspectives that can mutually compare by viewpoint, one gains background knowledge beyond just understanding one view of human nature. This way, one secures core knowledge for various adjacent problems.\\n○ Background Knowledge Begins with Interesting Critical Reading\\nBackground knowledge can become very rigid learning. The feeling of being rigid and dry comes from learning or reading methods that exclude interest, not from background knowledge itself. While it's true that most philosophy books are somewhat boring, philosophy books themselves contain themes or concepts that anyone can find interesting. If one overlooks such interest and reads blindly from the first page, one is bound to quickly become exhausted. The reason test-takers particularly cannot easily turn pages when looking at textbooks or hagwon materials is due to reading habits that overlook such interest.\\nInteresting reading begins not with mechanically looking at books, but with focusing on one interesting table of contents theme and reading related themes. This requires proper guidance. For example, when reading Camus's 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' one may initially get the impression that Sisyphus is suffering from meaningless labor. Also, according to Camus, one can know that he is actually a figure with indomitable will and courage who does not give up. This part is content delivered abstractly through secondary reading by textbooks or hagwon instructors. If one truly wants to make the overall implications into completely personal background knowledge, one should understand Sisyphus by connecting him to one's own parents who live mechanical daily lives for their children rather than themselves for decades, and to one's own life as a test-taker enduring painful exam preparation for college admission or law school acceptance. The method of again comparing Sisyphus and parents to Prometheus is a sublime critical thinking process that sublimates classics into one's personal experience. Today, right now, explore Camus's earnest life archetype that he wants to express through Sisyphus!\\nKwon Gu-hyeon, Elim Edu CTI Research Committee Member\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3400, "output_tokens": 878, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

At this time, harmonizing students' desires with their objective abilities is one of the most difficult challenges. Most test-takers want to receive higher scores than their current grades and enter universities where their chances of admission are high.\\n\\nSince education is based on students' future potential, I don't blame these test-takers for this mindset. Students always study hard and expect grade improvement, but their grades don't rise as much as they think they will.\\n\\nWhy is this? This is the core concern of test-takers. Even this year, I want to tell test-takers who are studying hard until the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] to change their methods and study differently.\\n\\nMost test-takers only study as much as others do. If everyone studies the same amount equally, it's not easy to improve grades.\\n\\nIf you want grade improvement, you need the mindset of always studying a little more than others. Use spare time or time you normally waste to solve even one more math problem than others.\\n\\nThe attitude of memorizing just 5 more English words than usual is important. The grade differences among test-takers are not originally large. You must remember that small differences always accumulate to create big differences. If you want to succeed, create small differences in your daily life.\\n\\nMore important for grade improvement is qualitative difference. The daily routines of 600,000 test-takers nationwide are almost similar. They do 'learning (學) = classes' and 'practicing (習) = self-study.' Since 'classes' involve interaction between teachers and students, individual student differences are not large. There can be qualitative differences in classes due to differences in teachers' abilities. Successful test-takers make good use of class time with an active attitude of participating enthusiastically in classes.\\n\\nMore important than classes is precisely 'self-study = self-directed learning.' Many students fall into the 'illusion' that they understand everything when listening to classes.\\n\\nAfter classes, they must study on their own and actually make that content 'their own.' Since self-study is conducted individually, individual student differences occur. Self-study must be done more thoroughly.\\n\\nStudents who study successfully digest 15 hours' worth of learning when they study for 10 hours. On the other hand, students who fail only achieve 3-4 hours of actual learning even when studying for 10 hours. This qualitative difference in 'self-directed learning' varies according to concentration, study plans, study efficiency, etc.\\n\\nEvery admissions season, students who boast excellent grades unanimously say they 'got enough sleep' and 'were faithful to classes.' This means there was a qualitative difference in learning.\\n\\nTo improve concentration, goal consciousness is most important. In other words, students who accurately recognize why they study hard have high concentration. We need to think that studying is a process of intellectual growth that realizes future dreams.\\n\\nPeople with weak concentration blame others, while people with strong concentration don't mind their surroundings. Concentration must be heightened to the extent that one is desperate.\\n\\nIf you flip through various books without a concrete plan when self-studying after classes end, you can consider it almost 100% failure. Without a study plan, tension cannot be maintained.\\n\\nStudents who have their own plans often feel regret when the dismissal bell rings. This happens when learning doesn't proceed according to plan. Day-by-day persistent cumulative learning ultimately connects to grade improvement.\\n\\nIt's necessary to keep in mind that study plans that complement one's weak points, as well as preparation and review for classes, are essential conditions for successful students and the shortcut to improving learning efficiency.\\n\\nThe absolute time given to test-takers is all the same. But relative time is different. Successful students maximize the time given to them.\\n\\nSince students themselves are the protagonists of their lives, they must strive to become masters of their own time. Do you want to succeed? Don't be dominated by time, but become the dominator. Let's do our best for our precious future!

The state has declared it will no longer regulate zero periods and yaja time, which had been controlled at the national level due to concerns that excessive competition and college entrance exam supremacism could harm students' health and human rights. Now Korea's educational field has entered 'Darwin's ecosystem,' pervaded by the survival of the fittest and law of the jungle competition. Thanks to this, Korean students are developing collective sleep disorders. Students who already can't get even 7 hours of sleep, let alone the 9 hours appropriate for adolescents, will now face situations where they must wake up an hour earlier.\\n\\nParents who had to wage war every morning to wake their children will now have to fight this arduous battle even earlier, but in fact, this isn't because our kids are lazy—it's because they're healthy. Melatonin, which regulates human sleep cycles, typically begins secreting around 11 PM during puberty and remains in the system until after 9 AM. This tendency becomes stronger as puberty progresses and is more pronounced in high school than middle school.\\n\\nThus, teenagers sleeping late into the morning is a very natural phenomenon. If your child wakes up at 6 AM, exercises, then wakes up parents asking for breakfast while reading the newspaper, take them to a nearby hospital. They might have the body of a 60-year-old.\\n\\n**Classes That Go Against Physiological Activity Have Reverse Effects**\\n\\nNow that zero periods have begun and students must go to school at 7 AM, they'll be eating lunch boxes before second period and rushing to the school store after third period ends. The revival of zero-period classes is highly likely to disrupt Korean teenagers' biological rhythms and increase obesity and being overweight.\\n\\nAccording to Dr. Mary Carskadon, a sleep scientist at Brown University, if teenagers appear listless, sensitive, or sullen, she recommends first examining whether they're getting sufficient sleep. Students who wake up before streetlights turn off cannot concentrate properly during class and are more likely to poorly regulate emotions like sadness or frustration. Irritable reactions also intensify, leading to increased classroom violence.\\n\\nSchools probably created the 'mathematically very bizarre' concept of zero period to improve students' learning abilities, but paradoxically, what Korean teenagers need most for high academic achievement is morning sleep.\\n\\nResearch results support this, showing that students score higher when they sleep even 3 hours before taking an exam rather than taking it after pulling an all-nighter. While we sleep, our brain transfers important information learned before sleep to long-term memory while cleanly erasing useless information to recharge for receiving new information. It's like the process of erasing the blackboard while copying important content to notes in preparation for the next class.\\n\\nSo if your child is sleeping diligently, don't scold them to go wash their face, but find peace of mind by reciting this mantra: 'Right now our kid is diligently transferring what they learned yesterday to long-term memory. They're getting tutoring at the biological sleep hagwon.'\\n\\nA few years ago, parents in various regions including Minneapolis, Minnesota and Katonah, north of New York City, persuaded school authorities based on sleep scientists' research results, saying 'Give our children the right to sleep in the morning.' Schools accepted this and delayed class times by 30 minutes, resulting in noticeably improved classroom atmosphere and higher SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test, a standardized college admission test in the US) scores. What Korean teenagers need most is sleep more than food, sleep more than hagwons.\\n\\n**America Proves 'Sufficient Sleep = Academic Improvement'**\\n\\nWhat's unfortunate is that most people deciding 'whether or not to have zero-period classes' are adults in their 50s and 60s whose melatonin secretion begins decreasing at 4 AM. They might feel very sorry that teenagers can't breathe the fresh dawn air because they're lying in bed sleeping. But please remember this fact: they too fought wars with their parents every morning during their teenage years due to insufficient sweet sleep.\\n\\nThe message that neuroscientists who study sleep want to convey about 'zero-period classes' is clear: if they wake up too early in the morning, teenagers can never enjoy going to school.\\n\\nJung Jae-seung, Guest Editorial Board Member, KAIST Department of Bio and Brain Engineering Professor\\njsjeong@kaist.ac.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3778, "output_tokens": 1080, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

After nearly a year, her Chinese has improved considerably, and she's also become familiar with Chinese customs. During Chunje [Chinese New Year] or Labor Day holidays like now, Chinese lessons also take a brief break. This Chinese instructor once worked at a Korean Chinese language hagwon. However, as she became familiar with Korean circumstances, she realized the hagwon was taking excessive profits. So she made a proposal to students: if they took classes directly without going through the hagwon, she would cut the tuition in half. From the students' calculation standpoint, there was no reason to refuse. This is one scene of 'globalization' vividly unfolding in our household.\\n\\nCarrefour Boycott is a Double-Edged Sword\\n\\nWhat implications does the nationalism, or what they call patriotism, that has been rampant in China around the Beijing Olympics have in the era of globalization? A Carrefour boycott movement is currently underway in China. It has a strong retaliatory character against the Olympic torch being extinguished by pro-Tibet protesters in Paris last month. Chinese people resolved to make May 1st, Labor Day, a 'day not to go to Carrefour,' and indeed Carrefour stores became empty and sales plummeted.\\n\\nThe Carrefour boycott began when text messages of unknown origin spread claiming that 'Carrefour's major shareholders are providing financial support to the Dalai Lama, and France supports Tibetan independence.' This raises two questions. First, did Carrefour really provide financial support to the Dalai Lama? Carrefour officially stated, 'We have never once provided financial support to the Dalai Lama.' But it was useless. It's similar to the situation in Korea where internet agitation works well, treating all American beef as if it's all mad cow disease beef.\\n\\nSecond, will the Carrefour boycott deal a blow to Carrefour and France? The Chinese government has essentially provided an answer to this. China's Ministry of Commerce revealed that 95% of products distributed in Carrefour stores in China are made in China, and 99% of all employees are Chinese. If so, the main victims of the Carrefour boycott should be seen as Chinese manufacturers, Carrefour's Chinese employees, and Chinese consumers. This is a case that specifically shows China is no longer outside the sphere of globalization.\\n\\nChina, which joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, is currently the world's fourth-largest economy and trading power by GDP, and ranks first in foreign exchange reserves and greenhouse gas emissions. China, 'the world's factory,' was the top contributor to global price stability until recently before raw material-driven inflation occurred. This was because it was the largest supplier of 'cheap goods' that people around the world buy and use. Former American journalist Sara Bongiorni concluded in her book 'A Year Without Made in China,' which chronicles her experience of surviving a year without buying Chinese products, that America without China doesn't exist. Even without the Beijing Olympics, a world without China has already become impossible to exist. Of course, China without the world is also unimaginable.\\n\\nDue to the Discord Between Growth and Political Powerlessness?\\n\\nIn an era when humanity is enjoying the greatest prosperity in history, the 'nationalism' being displayed by young people in China, the greatest beneficiary of this era, is as incongruous as flowers blooming out of season. Some evaluate the so-called balinghou [post-1980s] generation, who grew up fully benefiting from China's economic growth, as a generation filled with pride in their homeland. However, Japanese scholar Takahara Motoaki views the nationalist tendencies of China's younger generation as 'a combination of mania from economic growth and depression from political powerlessness stemming from an undemocratic system.' I tend to agree with this opinion.\\n\\nThe phenomenon of globalization's beneficiaries being inclined toward nationalism is indeed paradoxical. However, the Moscow Olympics or Los Angeles Olympics, which were held only halfway due to ideological issues, cannot be repeated now. There are many Western companies sponsoring the Beijing Olympics. The interests of the Beijing Olympics and Western companies are intertwined. All the more reason why China's young people need to understand something: that they are able to enjoy today's benefits because China pursued reform and opening up and actively participated in the flow of globalization.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3635, "output_tokens": 1069, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

For test-takers, entrance exam season begins as soon as midsummer passes. For this reason, students must carefully consider whether to apply for early admission from now on. Students who are strong in school records but weak in CSAT mock exams should aim for a 'college entrance reversal' through essay exams in early admission. Lee Man-gi, evaluation director at Uway Jungang Education, said, 'Top-tier students would have steadily prepared essays from their first year, but students who haven't can still get into mid-to-upper-tier universities if they start preparing now.' Even when preparing essays, one cannot neglect CSAT studying. This is because CSAT is the most important screening factor in regular admission, and major universities present 'within 2nd grade in 2 CSAT subjects' as the minimum academic standard for early admission acceptance. Let's carefully examine each university's early admission essay reflection ratio, set target universities, and establish 'short and efficient' period-specific essay learning strategies.》\\n\\nBefore vacation, grasp various types... During vacation, solve target university past exam problems\\n\\n○ Pinpointing 3-4 Target Universities\\nWhile most universities hold second-semester early admission essay exams in mid-October, just before CSAT, Ewha Womans University holds theirs in mid-September, and some universities like Korea University and Yonsei University hold essay exams right after CSAT. Since students must go 'all-in' on CSAT preparation after September, essay exam preparation must be completed by summer vacation. Test-takers need to set 3-4 target universities in advance, considering their June CSAT mock evaluation scores and universities' screening methods (see table), to establish efficient strategies.\\n\\nEssay exams require customized preparation because each university has slightly different problem types such as number of questions and character limits, and different directions in question creation. It's advisable to carefully read past exam problems, explanations, and grading criteria posted on each university's admissions homepage to understand the target university's essay question trends.\\n\\n○ Period-Specific Learning Strategies\\nThe period when test-takers can study essays is about three months from late May until summer vacation ends. Lee Young-deok, evaluation director at Daesung hagwon, said, 'Until summer vacation, students should practice becoming familiar with question types by solving various past exam problems from major universities for 3 hours once a week.'\\n\\nFor humanities essays, there are largely three types: summary type, passage comparison type, and alternative suggestion type. For test-takers just starting essay preparation, learning question types is urgent. At this time, it's good to solve various past exam problems not only from target universities but also from major universities. Among essay questions, except for conclusion derivation, the other two are virtually the same as having set answers, so it's effective to solve problems while comparing model answers with one's own answers. It's also good to practice solving problems within set time limits while timing yourself.\\n\\nDuring summer vacation, students should study 3 hours twice a week, focusing on 'target university' past exam problems. Since last year's and this year's question trends don't differ greatly, students should solve all of last year's early and regular admission essay past exam problems. During this period, students shouldn't stop at just solving problems but must receive 'editing guidance' on their answers. Students should have their answers evaluated through school Korean teachers, hagwon instructors, or EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) essay editing programs, and rewrite them once more to improve their skills. It's also helpful to solve problems according to the actual essay exam time schedule.\\n\\nSince there's relatively more free time during vacation, when dealing with questions asking for one's own argument, it's good to write both supporting and opposing opinions.\\n\\nPark Shin-young, who entered Kyung Hee University's Law Department this year through the early admission essay track, sometimes wrote one past exam problem from three different perspectives. For the question 'Based on the passage about cultural relativism, discuss how polygamy in Islamic society can be evaluated,' she wrote three different answers: content affirming polygamy, content denying it, and content affirming some elements while denying others. This approach not only develops thinking power but also secures various supporting materials, helping when solving other problems.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3549, "output_tokens": 1070, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

More precisely, it stemmed from setting only sections with distances of less than 20km between highway interchanges as eligible for discounts.\\nMany residents in the Seoul metropolitan area receive toll discounts under this standard. But the situation is different in the provinces, where regions are relatively larger. Cases of commuting distances of 30-40km are not uncommon.\\nLet's examine the area around Daegu.

Criticism of 'hasty administration' that failed to properly grasp regional living characteristics and the number of commuters by section is naturally arising.\\nGovernment policies depend on efficiency and equity. Transportation administration, which citizens feel in their daily lives, should find concerns and solutions 'in the field.'\\nWhile cutting tolls by up to half is commendable, the policy should have been properly designed so that provincial residents wouldn't feel relative deprivation.\\nIsn't it time to stop the practice of creating policies first and then making a fuss about fixing the barn only after complaints or side effects emerge?\\nBefore implementing any policy, one should think sufficiently from the consumer's perspective and improve problems.

In particular, besides the Korea Science Academy in Busan, Seoul Science High School will be converted to a gifted school and science high school education will be expanded. Although 25 years have passed since the term \\\"gifted education\\\" was introduced to Korea starting with Gyeonggi Science High School, the spirit of gifted education has not been realized through science high school programs, and there have been various flaws and side effects. However, it is desirable to expand opportunities for more students in science education to develop empirical thinking, creativity, and imagination.\\n\\nNow most cities have private gifted education institutes targeting children from infants to high school students, so one might wonder what's so special about gifted education. Universities and education offices have established gifted education institutes and gifted classes, putting effort into mathematics and science education at the elementary and secondary levels. On the other hand, it is also widely known that even talented children like Park Tae-hwan [Olympic swimming champion] or Kim Yuna [Olympic figure skating champion] have been maintained through hagwon education rather than school education support. Meanwhile, some parents who misunderstand gifted education complain that their children are not receiving accelerated education. Recently, when a university education center emphasized autonomous learning to students, parents withdrew their children, saying they couldn't waste time for children who were busy going places.\\n\\nMathematics and science gifted education is special education targeting adolescent students with special scientific talents. It is unknown how many such students there are in Korea. Scholars say it is desirable to select gifted education candidates from roughly the top 3%, while in the United States from roughly the top 30% of students, but this varies by country according to educational and cultural environments.\\n\\nThen is such education really necessary at the high school level? Because we have been bound too long by college preparatory education, science career education programs based on students' aptitudes and interests have not been developed. Youth who dream of becoming scientists and engineers must build solid foundational knowledge and capabilities in mathematics and science to receive professional education at universities. Gifted education is not accelerated education that increases the quantity or level of knowledge, nor is it supplementary classes to compensate for lacking individual capabilities.\\n\\nGifted education starts with finding those who need special education. Simply put, it means discovering students with an irrepressible motivation of 'dying to learn.' It means finding students who possess scientific thinking skills and inquiry abilities, not simply memorizing knowledge. Because regular school education cannot be applied to such students, gifted schools are designated as the main providers of special education, supported by the nation and society to contribute to science and technology education.\\n\\nMy smart child - could they be gifted? These days, identifying giftedness in young children is spreading like a trend. This is pathetic. Gifted education is not 'Cinderella's glass slipper' that must be forcibly fitted onto my child, but simply educating talented children who need special education. Therefore, gifted education is not college entrance-focused education but an educational program where career guidance is more important, and it is practical education that helps students develop empirical thinking abilities and creative problem-solving capabilities.

First-year high school students facing the new college entrance system for the first time in the 2008 academic year, the so-called 'cursed class of '89,' gathered at Gwanghwamun in Seoul after exchanging text messages. It was a protest against school record-focused admissions. They denounced, saying 'School record competition has made us feel like we're taking entrance exams throughout our entire three years of high school.'\\n\\nDemagoguery that stirs discriminatory sentiment\\n\\nThe flustered government moved to contain the situation. Kim Jin-pyo, then Deputy Prime Minister for Education, soothed the students saying 'You don't need to worry much about school records.' This was a statement that reversed his previous emphasis that 'school records are important.' The political world was tense. The Uri Party criticized the Ministry of Education, blaming insufficient promotion. The enormous destructive power that emerges once teenagers take to the streets has been repeatedly confirmed through the 2002 memorial protests for Hyo-soon and Mi-seon, the 2005 protests against school record-based admissions, and this recent protest against US beef imports.\\n\\nLast Saturday's candlelight protest at Gwanghwamun was officially called the 'No to Mad Cow Disease and Crazy Education! Candlelight Cultural Festival.' What catches attention is the addition of the new item 'crazy education' to 'mad cow,' which refers to the US beef issue. This suggests where the next battlefront will form when the 'mad cow' controversy subsides.\\n\\n'Crazy education' refers to the 'School Autonomy Plan' announced by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology last month. The plan allows individual schools to conduct zero-period classes and differentiated instruction based on their circumstances, and to invite hagwon instructors for supplementary classes at low cost after regular school hours. Viewed positively, it's a measure to grant autonomy to schools and reduce hagwon education costs.\\n\\nHowever, organizations like KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) view this plan as driving students into infinite competition. They also attack the policy of bringing hagwon instructors into schools as a measure that turns schools into hagwons.\\n\\nBetween these two opposing logics, there's a sense that KTU's arguments are resonating with students. Students participating in the candlelight rallies believe that if US beef is imported, it will first be used in school meals. Also, picket signs reading 'We are not studying machines' have appeared. They view both issues as their own problems.\\n\\nBeyond the school autonomy plan, the Lee Myung-bak administration's educational reform measures are lined up one after another. A plan to disclose regional academic achievement information is scheduled to be announced soon, and high school diversification plans including excellent schools called 'autonomous private high schools' are being materialized. When these policies are implemented, areas could be divided into 'high academic achievement regions' and 'low academic achievement regions,' 'good schools' and 'bad schools.' If resentment about discrimination spreads, it becomes an opportunity for activist organizations. This makes possible marketing that intentionally stokes consciousness of discrimination and equality.\\n\\nTherefore, the 'crazy education' issue is likely to stimulate student sentiment as much as 'mad cow,' which touched on instinctive anxieties about food. In terms of destructive power, it might even surpass the beef crisis. KTU has entered a head-on confrontation with its chairman going on a hunger strike, and the Democratic Labor Party is preparing to frame zero-period classes as violations of student human rights. If the new government's education policies result in significantly increased hagwon education costs, an even worse situation could emerge.\\n\\nThe song called 'It's Fine Song' sung at this candlelight rally shows that the activist camp is stimulating students' emotions with a meticulous strategy. 'If you have zero period, sleeping 3 hours is fine / Eating mad cow at lunch is fine / If holes form in your head from that, being scattered in the Grand Canal [a controversial Lee Myung-bak infrastructure project] is fine / ...'\\n\\nWin parents' hearts through thorough preparation\\n\\nThe government shouldn't just complain about such propaganda and agitation. Right after announcing the school autonomy plan, Minister of Education Kim Do-yeon said, 'I thought all citizens would welcome and like it' when there was some backlash. While the opposition is thinking several moves ahead, this shows a frustrating grasp of reality.\\n\\nFortunately, when looking at educational policy content alone, the left-wing camp's equalization line lost persuasive power long ago. The government must first capture parents' hearts through precise policy implementation that encompasses marginalized groups. If there was a learning effect from the US beef crisis, now is the time to show it.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3595, "output_tokens": 1169, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

I think I've encountered every type possible: children with exceptional abilities, children who were the ultimate hard workers, and children armed with laziness and insincerity. Through that experience, I reached one clear conclusion: 'No child can be lazy and still excel at studying.' In other words, not a single child who excelled at studying was lazy.\\n\\nLazy children don't simply struggle with studying—they are highly likely to live failed lives. Fixing laziness in childhood is far more important than raising test scores by a few points. There's a passage I often quote to children struggling against laziness:\\n\\n'A person who is lazy for one day will be poor for ten days; a person who is lazy for ten days will be poor for a hundred days; a person who is lazy for a hundred days will be poor for one year; and a person who is lazy for one year will never escape poverty for their entire life.'\\n\\nPerhaps the best way to excel at studying, the best way to get accepted to specialized high schools [elite schools focused on specific subjects like science or foreign languages], is to escape laziness as quickly as possible. However, we know all too well that this is never an easy task. It requires tremendous effort and patience.\\n\\nThe best way to fix laziness is for parents themselves to consistently show a busy and diligent lifestyle. If a mother puts off her own work to do her child's art homework instead, what would motivate the child to do anything on their own? She must draw appropriate boundaries by saying, 'Mom is very busy with mom's work. Handle your own affairs yourself.' Parents must teach children until they develop the habit of handling their own responsibilities.\\n\\nChildren who excel at studying are three steps ahead in diligence. One step ahead in their attitude toward listening in class, one step ahead in reviewing what they've learned, and one step ahead in previewing what they'll learn tomorrow—three steps ahead in total.\\n\\nThese children have exceptional time management skills, though they never learned this anywhere special. They memorize English vocabulary learned in class during break time and use commuting time to memorize entire English sentences. They even review science formulas learned that day while helping their mothers peel garlic. The minds of diligent children never rest. Even while walking or sitting in the bathroom, they solve math problems or review English problems. They don't excel at studying by being glued to books all day long, but by effectively utilizing these spare moments that others easily overlook.\\n\\nStudying is also a battle against time. The results you achieve depend on how much time you invest. Time meaninglessly wasted today through laziness will inevitably return as a regrettable tomorrow.\\n\\nReflect on yourself at this very moment. And plan your day. Lack of planning is the shortcut to breeding laziness. Children's laziness will solidify day by day for every moment left unplanned. Wise parents thoroughly plan and execute their time together with their children. Rather than vaguely hoping our children will excel at studying, let's make concrete plans with our precious children right now.\\n\\nPark Kyo-sun, Director of Admissions at Youngjae Science Academy Hagwon\\n※Excerpted from 'No Matter What Anyone Says, We're Going to Minjok Leadership Academy [a prestigious boarding school] and Specialized High Schools'\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3176, "output_tokens": 807, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The government predicted that increasing the weight of school records in admissions would make students focus on school classes and reduce hagwon education accordingly, but hagwon education spending actually increased because students had to excel in all subjects to improve their school records. The essay-writing exam that emerged after the government abolished written university entrance exams in 1997 also greatly increased hagwon education spending. Preparation for essay-writing exams conducted immediately after CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] created time constraints that imposed large financial burdens on parents. We have experienced that when the government intervenes in admission systems under the pretext of reducing hagwon education costs, even larger hagwon education markets form to circumvent those regulations.\\n\\nThe Lee Myung-bak administration is showing signs of regulating college admission systems. Yesterday, President Lee summoned 14 university presidents nationwide to the Blue House and emphasized 'establish college admission systems first, normalize elementary, middle, and high school education second,' saying \\\"Elementary, middle, and high school education can be normalized only when college admission systems are well established.\\\" This seems to view admission systems as the root cause of educational problems.\\n\\nPrior to this, Kwak Seung-jun, chairman of the Presidential Committee on Future Planning, announced regulatory measures for foreign language high school admissions while declaring 'war on hagwon education.'

Admission regulations alone can never reduce hagwon education costs. If all responsibility is shifted to admissions, the core goal of educational policy—'strengthening public education'—may become blurred.\\n\\nGovernment intervention should stop at demanding social responsibility from universities.

Photo provided by Princeton Review language hagwon\\n■ Four US University Admits Say \\\"This is How I Got In\\\"\\n《It's no longer unusual to see students graduating from Korean high schools and heading to prestigious American universities for study abroad. According to a survey conducted by Haneul Education Co., Ltd., a hagwon specializing in gifted education and special purpose high school admissions, on foreign university study abroad among major foreign language high schools and independent private high schools nationwide, the number reached about 510 students. The number would likely increase further if students from science high schools and general high schools were included. The successful applicants said that the key to studying abroad at American universities lies in achieving high scores on the SAT [Scholastic Assessment Test, the American college entrance exam], engaging in various activities during high school, and writing creative personal statements (essays).》\\n\\n○ SAT is Core Criterion for Understanding Student Capabilities\\n\\nMost American universities have operated admissions officer systems for decades, evaluating students' various activities in their admissions process. Still, the foundation is achieving high scores on the SAT, which corresponds to Korea's CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam). While there are no specifically set scores or cut-off lines, among international students it's said that to enter American Ivy League universities, one needs at least 2,200 points out of a perfect score of 2,400. Jason Lee, director at Princeton Review language hagwon, said, \\\"From the perspective of American universities, Korean students are foreigners, so SAT scores serve as the most important and objective criterion for understanding students' core capabilities.\\\"\\n\\nKim Hyo-seok, who graduated from Korea Science Academy and was accepted to Columbia University, said, \\\"From the moment you decide to study abroad, whether in 10th grade or early 11th grade, you should start SAT preparation immediately and do it consistently,\\\" adding, \\\"Like Korea's CSAT, it's important to make good wrong-answer notebooks for the SAT as well.\\\" Kim said, \\\"Study abroad preparers commonly show 'step-like SAT scores,'\\\" and advised, \\\"When the period of no score improvement gets long, don't give up and use wrong-answer notebooks to identify lacking question types.\\\"\\n\\nManaging school records (GPA) is also important. In Kim's case, he received good evaluations from admissions officers with excellent school records of 4.0 out of a perfect 4.3. Kim Na-yeon, who graduated from Korea Science Academy and was accepted to Yale University, also had school records in the top 10%. Kim said, \\\"If SAT scores are high but school records are low, admissions officers would naturally become suspicious,\\\" adding, \\\"Even if scores are relatively low in freshman year, you can receive good evaluations if they gradually improve as you advance in grade level.\\\"\\n\\n○ Science Track Students Must Choose Between R&E and Olympiad\\n\\nLee Ji-su from Incheon Science High School, who was accepted to the University of Chicago, said, \\\"American universities show great interest in special activities inside and outside school during high school,\\\" adding, \\\"For science track students, either producing excellent research results through R&E (Research & Education) programs that combine research and education, or dedicating themselves to Olympiads and winning prizes at world competitions becomes a major positive factor for admission.\\\"\\n\\nDue to these characteristics of American universities, there are difficulties for study abroad from Korea's general academic high schools, which must strictly follow the National Common Basic Curriculum. Because classes to follow the curriculum are overwhelming, schools cannot even consider supporting special activities.\\n\\nKwon Jin-hyeok from Ohyeon High School in Jeju, a general academic high school, who was accepted to Rice University, said, \\\"At general academic high schools, you can't expect any activities other than predetermined subjects like ethics, physical education, society, and science,\\\" adding, \\\"The most difficult thing was having to find and seek out everything on my own without school support.\\\" Kwon had been doing volunteer work at facilities for the disabled since 8th grade and participated in the English newspaper club at school. He entered English newspaper production competitions and won prizes, and also participated in invention contests and received awards.\\n\\nOn the other hand, at special purpose schools like science high schools, gifted schools, and foreign language high schools, many students can participate in R&E programs involving professors as well as collaborative classes with domestic universities. In Lee Ji-su's case, research conducted in 10th grade with Professor Park Su-jong from Kyung Hee University's Department of Astronomy and Space Science on 'Development of Cloud Amount Measurement Device Using TEC Elements,' in 11th grade with Professor Lee Hyung-mok from Seoul National University's Department of Physics and Astronomy on 'Observation and Mechanical Analysis of Star Clusters Using Small Telescopes,' and in 12th grade with Professor Lim Myeong-shin from Seoul National University's Department of Physics and Astronomy on 'Exoplanet Exploration' greatly helped with acceptance to American universities.\\n\\n○ Essays: Write Freely Based on Personal Experience\\n\\nWhile essay writing is perceived as the most challenging aspect for students preparing to study abroad in America, successful students said essays were actually comfortable and enjoyable. This is because they can be written creatively without being bound by fixed formats or frameworks.\\n\\nKim Na-yeon wrote an essay using as material her appearance as the protagonist of a TV program while preparing for an international science and technology competition. The title was 'True Woman Show,' borrowed from the American movie The Truman Show. Kim said, \\\"I wrote the essay by looking at myself living under the name of 'gifted student' in Korea through another perspective via the TV screen,\\\" adding, \\\"Having unique experiences different from others made writing the essay relatively easy.\\\"\\n\\nLee Ji-su also received good evaluations by composing an essay titled 'All up in the sky' about his longing for the sky and the wonder of the universe, based on his experience visiting and conducting research at the Maidanak Observatory in Uzbekistan.\\n\\n○ Application Preparation Should Start from Summer Vacation\\n\\nAmerican university application work requires extensive preparation, from school selection to essay writing, recommendation letters, and additional material attachments. Since early admission applications are concentrated in early November of 12th grade and regular admission in early January, it's good to start preparing from summer vacation when there's somewhat more time flexibility. If you don't have SAT scores yet, you can gauge which schools you can apply to through mock test scores taken during summer vacation. Usually, one student writes 10-13 applications.\\n\\nKim In-woo, director at Princeton Review language hagwon, said, \\\"For essays that aren't given specific topics by the respective schools, like personal statements, writing them in advance during summer vacation allows for efficient use of time.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4448, "output_tokens": 1635, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Since early March, she has been taking Arabic classes at a hagwon in Seoul. She judged Arabic to be a subject with high return (grades) on investment (time).\\n\\nWhy Arabic? Ms. Jang explained, \\\"Compared to other second foreign languages, Arabic has relatively easy questions on the CSAT, and the overall average scores of test-takers are low.\\\" This means that answering just one more question correctly than others can significantly boost standardized scores. Ms. Jang revealed, \\\"Many students study Arabic using spare time since you can solve most problems just by memorizing the Arabic alphabet.\\\"》\\n\\nChoosing subjects with better percentile scores than standardized scores is advantageous\\nAvoid subjects with severe difficulty fluctuations\\nIf considering early admission, choose career-related subjects\\n\\nMs. Jang, who is studying Arabic as a strategic subject for 2 hours per week, also decided early on her social studies exploration subjects. Targeting Seoul National University's humanities programs, she began reviewing Korean History—designated as a required subject by Seoul National University—immediately after last year's CSAT ended. Having learned from experience that the exploration areas allow score improvements proportional to time invested, she knew it was advantageous to choose subjects early and prepare thoroughly.\\n\\nCSAT experts unanimously agree that \\\"selecting elective subjects is a very important issue, as when, which subjects, and how many you choose affects the range of universities you can apply to.\\\" They emphasize that elective subjects must be wisely chosen considering various factors including one's grades and interests, as well as the number of test-takers per subject and university-specific admission requirements.\\n\\nHow to choose elective subjects that are advantageous for you?\\n\\n○ Choose early, make final decisions after the June mock exam\\n\\nThe earlier you decide on elective subjects, the more advantageous it is. Since the CSAT exploration areas include many questions that can only be solved with perfect understanding of basic concepts and principles, systematic learning beyond simple memorization is necessary.\\n\\nHowever, deciding which subjects to choose on the CSAT from among 11 social studies subjects and 8 science subjects is not as easy as it seems. The difficulty gap between subjects varies each year, and universities reflect different numbers of elective subjects, so hasty decisions on elective subjects can lead to disaster.\\n\\nLee Jong-seo, director of admissions consulting at Cheongsol Hagwon, explained, \\\"It's advisable to first prioritize which subjects to choose based on your mock exam scores so far and your target university's admission requirements (whether there are required designated elective subjects), then make final decisions based on the June evaluation agency mock exam results.\\\" However, since mock exam difficulty varies each time, it's advantageous to prioritize subjects where percentile scores perform better than standardized scores.\\n\\n○ Avoid these subjects!\\n\\nThere may be subjects that are strategically advantageous not to choose at all. Boldly excluding subjects with relatively few test-takers (see table) and subjects with relatively large difficulty fluctuations (Law and Society, Korean History/Physics) can actually be beneficial. With these subjects, even one mistake can cause standardized scores to drop significantly.\\n\\nSubjects chosen by many high-achieving students also require careful consideration. If you lack confidence, not choosing them is also an option. For example, Korean History is required for top-tier humanities students targeting Seoul National University, so it may be relatively disadvantageous for mid-to-lower tier students.\\n\\n○ You must choose these subjects!\\n\\nTest-takers considering early admission should choose one or two subjects related to their future career path. This allows simultaneous preparation for essay-writing exams and interviews while preparing for the CSAT, which is ideal.\\n\\nFor upper-mid tier students, it's advisable to choose elective subjects centered on what they learn in school during their senior year, managing both school records [high school transcript grades] and CSAT preparation simultaneously. Conversely, for lower-tier students, in humanities it may be advantageous to choose Korean Geography (which has many test-takers) or Society and Culture (which has relatively little content to study), and for natural sciences, to choose memorization-focused subjects. Since subjects with fewer test-takers have larger standardized score fluctuations depending on exam difficulty, choosing subjects with many test-takers is also a strategy.\\n\\n○ Aim for killing two birds with one stone!\\n\\nSocial studies subjects are divided into four categories based on their nature: △Geography (Korean Geography, World Geography, Economic Geography) △General Social Studies (Politics, Economics, Society and Culture, Law and Society) △History (Korean History, Korean Modern and Contemporary History, World History) △Ethics. Since subjects within the same area have overlapping content, it's advantageous to choose subjects with high mutual correlation together.\\n\\nFor science subjects, since Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Earth Science all allow connected learning between Level I and II courses, it's advisable to choose both Level I and II for subjects you're confident in.\\n\\n○ Choose Second Foreign Language/Chinese Characters area after checking target university admission requirements\\n\\nWhen selecting the Second Foreign Language/Chinese Characters area, you must check your target university's admission requirements. While some schools like Seoul National University specify that students applying to humanities programs must take the Second Foreign Language/Chinese Characters area, other universities like Korea University, Yonsei University, and Hanyang University allow one elective subject score from the exploration areas to substitute for the Second Foreign Language/Chinese Characters area score.\\n\\nWhen checking target university admission requirements, you should also examine the number of elective subjects required. Some universities including Seoul National University, Sungkyunkwan University (take 4 subjects, submit 3 subject scores), POSTECH, and military academies require taking 4 elective subjects. Since a 'disaster' of being unable to apply to your desired university because of one elective subject can occur, admission requirements must be thoroughly checked.\\n\\n(Advisory: Cho Heon-seop, Manager of Education Development Department at Uway Jungang Education; Kim Myeong-jun, Vice Principal of Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Daesung Hagwon; Megastudy)\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4323, "output_tokens": 1539, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Let's examine cases of students who succeeded in domestic and international college admissions through outstanding extracurricular activities and experts' evaluations of their activities. Through this, let's create our own 'portfolio.'》\\n\\nNurturing Dreams by Creating 'Clean Hands'\\n[Admitted to Sungkyunkwan University Social Sciences Leadership Special Talent Program]\\nPark Yong-heul (18), who graduated from Cheongmyeong High School in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, steadily built his career with the dream of becoming a 'human rights lawyer specializing in social law.' Park formed the school law club 'Mani Pulite' (meaning 'clean hands' in Italian, referring to the anti-corruption movement that began in Italy in 1992) when he was a high school freshman. He met once a week with five friends who liked law to study using the textbook 'Youth Law and Life.' In his sophomore year, he competed in the 'National High School and University Mock Trial Competition' hosted by the Ministry of Justice and placed second.\\n\\nHe also engaged in various other activities. In his sophomore year, he verified his debate skills by winning the Minister of Unification Award at the '4th National High School Unification Debate and Essay Competition,' and in his senior year, he served as a participating member of the National Youth Cooperation Committee under the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Family Affairs.\\n\\n[Kim Chang-min, Sungkyunkwan University Admissions Officer]\\nPark steadily built his career in activities related to his career path by directly creating a club, and was comprehensively recognized for his achievements in competition awards. Consistent activities receive high evaluation in that they show one can become an expert or leader in that field. Park's activities had the 'keyword' of 'law.' What stood out was that he acted independently rather than through hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] pushed by parental pressure.\\n\\nDigging Deep into 'Physics' Throughout Vacation\\n[Admitted to Olin College of Engineering in the US with Full Scholarship]\\nMoon Seung-hwan (18), who graduated from Minjok Leadership Academy, created an unofficial physics inquiry discussion club called 'Hyeoumnarae' (Korean for 'wings of thought') with four friends in the first semester of 2007. Moon prepared for the 'Korea Young Physicists' Tournament (KYPT)' with club members through a 4-night, 5-day retreat, discussing physics in English.\\n\\nDuring the semester, they held regular research meetings, and during vacations, they voluntarily stayed in the dormitories to guard the laboratory and repeat experiments and discussions. For necessary experimental equipment, they went to Seoul's Cheonggyecheon and Guro-dong tool markets to obtain materials and build devices themselves.\\n\\nMoon and his club members won first place in KYPT during their senior year after researching 14 physics experiment problems and engaging in discussions. They passed on physics experiment demonstrations and discussion know-how to underclassmen who applied to the club out of interest in basic science and physics experiments.\\n\\nMoon plans to major in physics at Olin College of Engineering in the US, member Kim Hyeon-mun (18) will study mathematics at Princeton University in the US, Lee Don-seok (18) will study applied physics at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the US, Baek In-su (18) will study physics and integrated science at Northwestern University in the US, and Choi Won-ho (18) will study physics and philosophy at Yale University in the US.\\n\\n[Kim Yeon-su, Minjok Leadership Academy International Program 3rd Grade Head Advisor]\\nMoon and his friends share the common trait of having alive 'intrinsic motivation' for loving physics and physics experiments very much. While others attended SAT [US college entrance exam] hagwons during vacation, these students explored experimental problems while cleaning the school physics laboratory. Rather than thinking of club activities as mere 'packaging' to look good during admissions, the fact that they strengthened their aptitude and developed sociability through teamwork seems to have worked positively in evaluations. If talent had been evaluated based only on numerical data, it might have been impossible, but admission was likely possible because of the American university system that recognizes extracurricular activities through essays and recommendation letters.\\n\\n'English Debate' Shown Through Activities\\n[Admitted to Oxford University Law School in the UK]\\nSeo Jae-hui (18, female), who graduated from Yongin Foreign Language High School, participated in five club activities. Having loved English since childhood and setting law school as her goal, Seo participated in an English drama club, English literature discussion club, mock trial club, English education volunteer club, and journalism club.\\n\\nEvery Saturday, as a member of the volunteer club 'EduIng,' she read English fairy tales to elementary students and taught them English at a nearby library. In the English drama club where she served as president, she directly wrote scripts for English plays to be performed at school festivals and participated in directing and acting. With skills built through mock trials with friends in the mock trial club, she received the best lawyer award at the 'Seoul Model United Nations-International Court of Justice (MUNOS-ICJ)' forum and won the grand prize at the 'National English Mock Trial Competition.'\\n\\n[Kim Myo-jung, Yongin Foreign Language High School International Career Department Head]\\nSeo received high scores for her outstanding English skills and consistent volunteer activities with the themes of 'English' and 'law.' Legal professionals must argue with law. The fact that they must persuade opponents with words (legal knowledge and logic) directly connects debate to language issues. It seems that being recognized for English skills through usual English-related club activities received good evaluation. While American universities look at students' potential, Britain focuses on expertise. Miss Seo's expertise was revealed in various activities.\\n\\nFinding Dreams in 'Lego Robots'\\n[Admitted to Chung-Ang University Da Vinci Program Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering]\\nKim Jin-hui (18, female), who graduated from Dongsan High School in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, was active in the robotics club 'Sangsang' (Imagination) during high school. In this club that researches Lego robots, Kim was in charge of the 'robot programming' field.\\n\\nKim served as a one-day teacher at robotics classes held at Hanyang University, showing Lego robots to elementary students and explaining robot principles, and operated a 'Lego Robot Classroom' at the Gyeonggi Science Festival, demonstrating moving robots to children.\\n\\nThe club won a silver prize at the 2006 National Creative Intelligence Robot Contest and a gold prize at the 2007 National Science Club Activity Presentation Competition. Kim stated in her personal statement that she developed the dream of becoming an 'electronic device programmer' while researching robot programming in the club.\\n\\n[Kim Bo-na, Chung-Ang University Admissions Officer]\\nKim received high scores for developing her dreams through club activities. The fact that she meticulously recorded and submitted research reports from preparing for various competitions, and that although she wasn't a leader, she had confidence and pride in her role within the club (robot programmer) worked positively in the evaluation.

This statement is still 'theoretically' valid today. It's certainly true when students clearly know which school they want.\\n\\nThe education office conducted another simulation from April 22 to May 3. However, the more simulations were conducted, the deeper the confusion grew among students and parents. Even parents who were serving as homeroom teachers for 9th graders complained of lack of information, saying \\\"I don't know which school to apply for.\\\"\\n\\nThe education office is also struggling to devise publicity measures. However, the only idea that emerged was to distribute a nearly 500-page 'School Choice Guide' to every student. A plan to establish a 'high school information portal site' where students could easily compare basic information by school was discussed, but was shelved due to concerns about creating school rankings. In the end, students and parents have no choice but to open up a book as thick as a phone directory and flip through pages to dig up information themselves. Even then, the college admission rates that parents are most interested in are not found anywhere in the book. Just printing books to give one to each of the more than 122,000 9th grade students in Seoul would cost over 1 billion won [approximately $760,000 USD]. Building a website would be sufficient with 30-40 million won [approximately $23,000-30,000 USD]. If the school information disclosure site 'School Info' that opened in December last year had contained the information students and parents wanted, this site wouldn't have been needed from the start.\\n\\nAt a Kwanhun Club [a prominent Korean press club] invitation forum on the 6th, Yonsei University President Kim Han-jung argued that \\\"university admissions are complex, but due to lack of information, parents seek out hagwon education companies to relieve their anxiety.\\\" This statement also applies to high school admissions. Since information is not disclosed, only hagwon education companies are whistling happily. The results of this simulation are also non-public. An education office official only let slip that \\\"like last year, most students chose schools close to home.\\\" This is frustrating. If they don't even know well the school in front of their house, how can they know information about schools in other areas?\\n\\nThe Constitutional Court decided on the 5th that the high school lottery system (Article 84 of the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) is constitutional. However, no citizen would think there are no problems with high school equalization. The school choice system is certainly a good system that can provide breathing room for education consumers who are fed up with equalization. However, for that exit to become a proper guide, information must be wide open.

To Teacher Yoon, who cared for his struggling students like his own children, the students personally made a plaque of appreciation to express their gratitude. Photo provided by Teacher Yoon Jeong-hyeon\\n\\nYoon Jeong-hyeon, the 'teacher who planted dreams' at Boseong Technical High School, emptied his wallet to help with application fees\\nReceiving Red Stripe Order of Service Merit today\\n\\nBoseong Technical High School in Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, was no different from any other technical high school just three years ago. Students would earn one or two certificates and then go out looking for employment. Every year, there were as many as six or seven students who entered society unable to properly read Korean, let alone English or math. This was no small number in a school with only about 50 students per grade.\\n\\nThree years ago, a major change came to Boseong Technical High School. Teacher Yoon Jeong-hyeon (49) was appointed and began constantly encouraging the children, and the children started to change. Teacher Yoon created a reading club and taught them starting from the basic Korean alphabet. After about a year, most of them had learned to read Korean. When newspapers introduced certificates that were advantageous for employment, Teacher Yoon would cut them all out and have the children read them. The children naturally came to realize the necessity of certificates and picked up books and tools.\\n\\nThe children learned to read and realized the necessity of studying, but another problem arose. Most of their families were too poor. Many students didn't have money to buy application forms for certificate exams, let alone hagwon fees. Teacher Yoon helped the children find suitable part-time jobs and emptied his own wallet to put application fees and transportation costs for taking exams into the children's hands.\\n\\nThe results were remarkable. Last year, 40 third-year students in the automotive department earned a total of 460 certificates. Earning double-digit certificates per person (average of 11.5) was the first record among vocational high schools nationwide. Park Ji-hyeon, who was a high school sophomore when she met Teacher Yoon last year, had aspired to be a discount store salesperson. This was because there was no one to tell her what jobs existed or what efforts she needed to make. After meeting Teacher Yoon, Park earned as many as 34 certificates and achieved great success, including winning the Korea Human Resources Award last year.\\n\\nTeacher Yoon, who moved to Jangheung Technical High School where he previously worked in March of this year, continues to work as a 'teacher like a biological parent.' Making home visits to carefully examine the environments the children face and reducing his sleep to provide appropriate career guidance for each individual has become his way of life. In recognition of these contributions, he will receive the Red Stripe Order of Service Merit on the 15th, marking the 28th Teacher's Day. Teacher Yoon humbly said, 'Looking at students who couldn't learn to read Korean no matter how much I taught them but focused on technical fields and earned 7 certificates, students who learned Korean in one year and earned various certificates, and students who worked at restaurants because they couldn't afford hagwon fees while studying day and night, I received much more teaching from them.'\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology will hold a Teacher's Day commemoration ceremony on the 15th at the Education and Culture Center in Yangjae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, and award medals and citations to 6,802 exemplary personnel including Teacher Yoon. The ceremony is jointly hosted by the Ministry of Education and teacher unions (Korean Teachers' Union, Free Teachers' Union, Republic of Korea Teachers' Union) excluding the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union [KTU, a left-leaning teachers' organization] and the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations.\\n\\nReporter Kim Hee-gyun foryou@donga.com\\n\\nTeacher's Day Award Recipients List\\n▽Red Stripe Order of Service Merit △Chungbuk Danjae Education Training Institute Lee Geun-cheong △Jangheung Technical High School Yoon Jeong-hyeon △Daejeon Oryu Elementary School Park Mu-yeong △Gyeongnam Girls' High School Park Il-yeong △Traditional Arts High School Kim Su-ran △Incheon Sinheung Elementary School Park Jin-sang ▽Green Stripe Order of Service Merit △Yulgok Elementary School Yoon Sam-hyeon △Gusan Elementary School Ahn Yeong-jun △Ganggyeong High School Kim Gyeong-ae △Gyeongsan Science High School Lee Chik-hee △Cheorwon Girls' High School Choi Seung-il △Korea University Kim Chang-jin △National Special Education Institute Lee Hyo-ja ▽Jade Stripe Order of Service Merit △Catholic Sangji University Kim Jae-mun △Icheon Nam Elementary School Ham Seong-eok △Daejeon Physical Education High School Lee Wang-bok △Jeonbuk Office of Education Moon Hong-geun △Maecheon Middle School Park Heon-yeong △Seoul Gadong Elementary School Gu Bon-guk △Seoul Sinhak Elementary School Park Sang-cheol △Gangneung High School Ham Yeong-se ▽Order of Service Merit △Gwangju Dongsin Girls' Middle School Yoon Yeong-mun △Masan Girls' High School Jeong Jae-pyo △Jindong Elementary School Hwang Seong-sik △Yeongdong Elementary School Lim Yeong-bin △Daejeon Gubong Middle School Na Do-chang △Gyeonggi Anyang Office of Education Park Ho-sun △Seongji High School Han Seung-bae △Modeok Elementary School Go Bun-ja △Daun Elementary School Heo Tae-gwon △Samsung Elementary School Jeong Hee-cheol △Gurungpo Elementary School Kwon Hyeok-su △Jeonju Jeil High School Lee Byeong-un △Kyungpook National University Elementary School attached to College of Education Kwon Gi-ok △Geumok Girls' High School Park Jong-won △Seomyeon Elementary School Jo Won-gu △Munmak Elementary School Lee Seong-pyo △Jemulpo Girls' Middle School Lee Jin-beom △Hanbat National University Seol Dong-ho △Gongju National University of Education Yu Won-jae\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3662, "output_tokens": 1641, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The Ministry reported various measures at the ruling party-government consultation that day, including schools without hagwon education, strengthening after-school programs, subject classroom systems, and hagwon management. These policies are difficult to view as new content since implementation plans have already been announced. However, the specialized high school admissions improvement plan is drawing attention as it contains content that has not been released until now.\\n\\nThe specialized high school admissions improvement measures that the Ministry is reviewing to reduce hagwon education include: prohibiting written evaluations at foreign language high schools starting from the 2010 academic year, and starting from the 2011 academic year △abolishing special admissions for academic olympiad winners and gifted education center graduates in science high school admissions and △preventing foreign language high schools from giving excessive weight to math and science in their admissions. The Ministry's policy is to exclude exams from olympiad and gifted class selection criteria and actively utilize the admissions officer system in science high school admissions.\\n\\nAmong these, the prohibition of written evaluations is content that the Ministry announced once in October last year through the 'Plan for Normalizing Specialized High School Operations and Improving Admissions.' In the cases of Seoul and Gyeonggi, provincial education offices have already implemented policies prohibiting written evaluations. Nevertheless, the Ministry believes that written exams are still effectively taking place, with some foreign language high schools conducting written tests disguised as oral interviews.\\n\\nAccordingly, language and social studies evaluations conducted in oral interview format in this year's foreign language high school admissions may also become targets of direct or indirect sanctions. With recent amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act preventing high school admissions from including problems above middle school level, and with clearer grounds for sanctions against specialized high schools, there are observations that the difficulty level of foreign language high school oral interview questions may decrease.\\n\\nHowever, English listening evaluations appear unlikely to see significant changes. The Ministry stated that even if written exams are abolished, English listening evaluations will be maintained. Since current English listening evaluations apply guidelines requiring questions to be drawn from middle school curriculum, the difficulty level is also expected to remain unchanged.\\n\\nChanges not previously announced will mainly apply from the 2011 academic year. More visible changes are expected in science high school admissions than foreign language high schools. First, they decided to abolish special admissions for academic olympiad winners and gifted education center graduates, which had the most decisive impact on science high school admissions. Currently, for science high schools, it is difficult to expect admission through either special or general admissions without excellent records in academic olympiads and international olympiads. The Ministry appears to view academic olympiads and international olympiads as encouraging expensive hagwon education for science high school preparation and has decided to find solutions achievable through public education.\\n\\nThe Ministry's planned alternatives are admissions officer evaluations or creativity tests. Just as in university admissions, admissions officers would participate in science high school admissions to evaluate elementary and middle school science achievement and potential. They are also reviewing introducing measures to comprehensively evaluate student creativity through science camps. The creativity assessment system that KAIST [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] applies in freshman selection serves as the model.\\n\\nStarting in 2011, each education office will likely determine the number of students selected through admissions officer and creativity assessment systems within half of each science high school's admission quota. The Ministry believes it is desirable to select 30-50% of students through this system in 2011 and more than half through this system from 2012 onward.\\n\\nLinked to science high school admissions, the selection methods for international olympiad participants and gifted education candidates are also expected to change. Moving away from exam-focused olympiad selection methods through hagwon education, they plan to determine international olympiad participants through principal recommendations or academic society reviews. Gifted class and gifted education center candidates are also expected to change to teacher observation and recommendation methods rather than exams. While specific evaluation methods have not yet been determined, the intention is to benchmark gifted education selection methods from advanced countries.\\n\\nThe biggest change in foreign language high school admissions from 2011 onward is abolishing math and science weighting. Currently, foreign language high schools give considerable weight to math and science when reflecting middle school records. This is because they believe it is a useful tool for identifying excellent students. The Ministry believes that since foreign language high schools are places to nurture foreign language talent, giving excessive weight to math or science is wrong. A Ministry official said, \\\"Some foreign language high schools reduce the transcript ratio for music or art to less than half while more than doubling the transcript reflection ratio for math or science, giving math and science 10-20 times more weight than other subjects,\\\" adding, \\\"We plan to regulate so that only reasonable levels of weighting can be given.\\\" In this case, weighting proportional to class hours by subject is expected to be permitted. For example, considering that current middle school weekly class hours are 4 hours each for math and science, a system allowing weighting up to 4 times that of art or music, which have 1 hour per week, is expected to be applied.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3890, "output_tokens": 1223, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Through principal and gifted education teacher recommendations\\n\\nOn the 18th, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology presented various measures in party-government consultations with the Hannara Party, including schools without hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring/academy industry], strengthening after-school programs, subject-specific classroom systems, and hagwon management. Most of these are contents whose implementation plans have already been announced. They are difficult to see as new content. However, the special-purpose high school admissions improvement plan is drawing attention as it contains content that has not been released before. The special-purpose high school admissions improvement plan is also the biggest point of interest among the hagwon education measures that the Ministry of Education will announce on the 28th. The attention at the public hearing scheduled for the 21st will certainly be focused here.\\n\\nThe special-purpose high school admissions improvement measures being considered by the Ministry of Education to reduce hagwon education costs are: prohibiting written evaluations at foreign language high schools starting from the 2010 academic year, and starting from the 2011 academic year, △abolishing special admissions for competition winners and gifted education center graduates in science high school admissions, and △preventing foreign language high schools from giving excessive weighting to math and science in their admissions. The Ministry of Education's policy is to exclude tests from Olympiad and gifted class selection criteria and to actively utilize the admissions officer system in science high school admissions as well.\\n\\n○\\nForeign language high schools likely to face restrictions on oral interviews\\n\\nAmong these, the prohibition of written evaluations is content that the Ministry of Education announced once in October last year through the 'Special-Purpose High School Operation Normalization and Admissions Improvement Plan.' In the cases of Seoul and Gyeonggi [province], provincial education offices have already issued policies prohibiting written evaluations. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education believes that written tests are effectively being conducted, with some foreign language high schools disguising written tests as oral interviews. Accordingly, language and social studies evaluations conducted in the form of oral interviews may become direct or indirect targets of sanctions starting from this year's foreign language high school admissions. There are also observations that the difficulty level of foreign language high school oral interview questions may decrease as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was recently revised to prevent high school admissions from including problems above middle school level, making the basis for sanctions against special-purpose high schools clearer.\\n\\nHowever, English listening evaluations are expected to see no significant changes. The Ministry of Education stated that even if written tests are abolished, English listening evaluations will be maintained. It explained that since current English listening evaluations are guided to be based on middle school curriculum, there will be no change in difficulty level either.\\n\\nChanges that have not been announced until now will mainly be applied starting from the 2011 academic year. Visible changes are expected more in science high school admissions than foreign language high schools. First, they decided to abolish special admissions for competition winners and gifted education center graduates, which had the most decisive influence on science high school admissions. Currently, for science high schools, unless one has outstanding competition and Olympiad achievements, it is difficult to expect admission not only through special admissions but also through general admissions. The Ministry of Education appears to view competitions and Olympiads as promoting expensive hagwon education for science high school preparation and has decided to find solutions that can be resolved through public education.\\n\\n○\\nScience high schools to model KAIST [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] freshman selection method\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education's planned alternative is admissions officer screening or creativity tests. Like in university admissions, admissions officers would participate in science high school admissions to evaluate elementary and middle school science achievement and potential. They are also considering introducing a plan to conduct multifaceted creativity evaluations through science camps. The creativity measurement screening that KAIST applies in freshman selection serves as the model. Initially, in the 2011 academic year, each education office is expected to determine the number of students selected through admissions officer and creativity measurement screening within half of each science high school's admission quota. The Ministry of Education views it as desirable to select 30-50% of the quota through this screening in the 2011 academic year and more than half through this screening from the 2012 academic year onward.\\n\\nConnected to science high school admissions, the selection methods for International Olympiad participants and gifted education candidates are also expected to change. Rather than test-focused Olympiad selection methods through hagwon education, they plan to determine International Olympiad participants through principal recommendations or academic society reviews. Gifted class and gifted education center candidates are also expected to change to teacher observation and recommendation methods rather than tests. While specific evaluation methods have not yet been determined, the intention is to benchmark advanced countries' gifted education selection methods.\\n\\n○\\nRegulation of math and science weighting at foreign language high schools\\n\\nThe biggest change in foreign language high school admissions from the 2011 academic year onward is abolishing math and science weighting. Currently, foreign language high schools give considerable weighting to math and science when reflecting middle school GPA. This is because they think it is a useful tool for identifying excellent students. The Ministry of Education believes that since foreign language high school admissions are for places that nurture foreign language talent, giving excessive weighting to math or science is wrong. A Ministry of Education official said, \\\"Some foreign language high schools reduce the GPA ratio for music or art to less than half while increasing the GPA reflection ratio for math or science by more than double, giving math and science weighting 10-20 times that of other subjects,\\\" adding, \\\"We plan to regulate so that only reasonable levels of weighting can be given.\\\" In this case, weighting proportional to class hours by subject is expected to be permitted.

Twelve full-time admissions officers are researching various screening methods. On the 29th, the university will host a conference on campus with the theme 'Exploring College Guidance Plans with the Admissions Officer System Together with College Guidance Teachers.'\\n\\nFor this year's admissions, the 'KU Admissions Officer Track' will select 325 students across categories including Leadership (30 students), Self-Recommendation (60 students), Arts (5 students), Next-Generation Overseas Koreans (30 students), Rural and Fishing Villages (120 students), Foreign Residents and Foreigners (60 students), and Special Education Candidates (20 students). Through first-stage document screening and second-stage in-depth interviews, applicants will be comprehensively evaluated and selected based on their major suitability, character and talent, and potential abilities. Evaluation of extracurricular areas in school records [GPA], which have been ignored in previous admissions, will be emphasized.\\n\\nThe 'Leadership Track' targets students who served as student body president, vice president, or class president, selecting students who can cooperate with others, accurately convey their opinions, and rationally accept others' opinions. Rather than simple titles, concrete examples of how students demonstrated leadership in various situations, what achievements they made, and how they overcame adversity become important evaluation factors. The 'Self-Recommendation Track' will evaluate applicants' potential and possibilities to the maximum extent through residential in-depth interviews. 02-450-4012, www.konkuk.ac.kr\\n\\n'Neo-Renaissance' for Selecting Creative Talent Draws Attention\\nKyung Hee University will select a total of 583 students through early admissions round 1 with the Neo-Renaissance track (140 students) for selecting creative talent and the Science Talent track (27 students) and Internationalization track (320 students) for selecting students with excellence in specific fields, and through regular admissions group 'B' with the Social Consideration Candidates track (96 students) for selecting students who have overcome difficult family circumstances.\\n\\nAll four tracks conduct document evaluation, and the Neo-Renaissance and Internationalization tracks also include interviews. The Neo-Renaissance track is divided into the Honor Student type (100 students) with high academic weight and the Creative type (40 students) with high specialty weight. In the first stage, three times the number of students are selected based on documents alone, and in the second stage, final successful candidates are determined by '60% first-stage scores + 40% interview scores.' Students wishing to apply can pre-register in the preliminary Neo-Renaissance candidate recommendation system on the admissions information homepage, where admissions officers will select candidates and continuously monitor them for use as basic data. The Internationalization track selects students through comprehensive calculation of 'document evaluation 60% + interview 40%.' The newly established Science Talent track this year reflects 'document evaluation 40% + school records [GPA] subject area 20% + essay-writing exam [a component of some university admissions] 40%.' The Social Consideration Candidates track selects students through comprehensive calculation of 'document evaluation 30% + school records [GPA] 20% + CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] 50%.'\\n\\nDocument evaluation examines three elements: 'Common (self-introduction letter, teacher recommendation letter),' 'Specialty (school records [GPA] extracurricular areas, elementary-middle-high school portfolio),' and 'Academic (school records [GPA] subject areas, other achievements).' 080-961-0028, http://iphak.khu.ac.kr/\\n\\nPlans to Select 567 Students Including Regional High Schools and Practical Skills Specialists\\nDankook University will select 222 students across five tracks: Creative Talent (20 students), Language Specialists (Jukjeon 135, Cheonan 31), Classical Chinese Specialists (8 students), Special Field Specialists (Jukjeon 8, Cheonan 2), and Working Students (Cheonan 18). Additionally, the university plans to expand the Creative Talent track recruitment to 40 students and expand admissions officer system recruitment to 567 students through Dankook Global Scholarship, Sister Regional High School Graduates, Math and Science Specialists, Art Specialists, Foreign Residents and Foreigners (all at Jukjeon campus), Local High School Graduates, and Outstanding Competition Results (all at Cheonan campus).\\n\\nDankook University's admissions officer system determines acceptance through in-depth interviews for students who have been verified in the first stage through step-by-step screening. For the Creative Talent track, students can apply if the average class rank of all subjects in one of the four university division-specific school record [GPA] reflection subjects is within 1.5 grade. In the first stage, five times the number of students are selected based on school records [GPA], and in the second stage, final selection is made through in-depth interviews alone. For the Dankook Global Scholarship track (Jukjeon), students must have an average class rank of all subjects in the four university division-specific school record [GPA] reflection subjects within grade 1 to apply, and selection is made through 100% in-depth interviews. Many benefits are provided including full tuition for 4 years of university and 2 years of graduate school, full dormitory fees, monthly academic incentive of 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD], and selective support for overseas study.

No 'CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] Minimum Academic Standards'\\nMyongji University will introduce the admissions officer system to the Christian Student Special Track in early admissions round 2, selecting a total of 72 students: 38 from the Humanities Campus (Seoul) and 34 from the Natural Sciences Campus (Yongin). The characteristic of Myongji University's admissions officers is that they have further deepened the existing interview-based selection. The qualification for applying to the Christian Student Special Track is to be a pure evangelical Christian (Baptist) church member in line with Myongji University's founding spirit and to receive recommendation from clergy of denominations that are members of the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC) or the Christian Council of Korea (CCK).\\n\\nThe screening method proceeds in three stages. In the first stage, admissions officers participate in document screening to examine the eligibility of all applicants. In the second stage, six times the recruitment number are selected based solely on school record [GPA] scores from applicants who passed document screening to determine interview candidates. Finally, final selection is made by combining 50% school record [GPA] scores and 50% in-depth interview scores conducted by admissions officers (pastors, clergy, teachers). There are no minimum academic standards based on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. For objective evaluation, applicants must submit supporting documents including volunteer activity details and award records from inside and outside school (including church activities) during high school.\\n\\nMyongji University plans to gradually expand the admissions officer system in various ways. The university also plans to expand selection through admissions officer system screening for language excellence students, athletic specialists, regional outstanding students, and special tracks for orphaned students and near-poor class students. 02-300-1799, 1800, www.mju.ac.kr/ipsi\\n\\nCollege Admissions Experts Participate... 2 Officers Interview 1 Student\\nSogang University's 'Admissions Officer Participation Track' is not particularly new. The documents to submit are the same as previous years: self-introduction letter and recommendation letter. The only difference is that admissions officers, who are college admissions experts rather than professors, conduct the screening.\\n\\nSogang University's admissions officers are involved in all special tracks for the 2010 academic year. They participate significantly in the Social Integration Special Track, Catholic Leader Recommendation Special Track, Equal Opportunity Selection Special Track, and Special Education Candidates Special Track.\\n\\nDocument screening targets self-introduction letters and recommendation letters, and school records [GPA] evaluate extracurricular areas. Interviews are conducted by two admissions officers for one applicant to verify the truthfulness of submitted documents. By recruitment period, the university conducts Social Integration (16 students) in early admissions round 1, Catholic Leader Recommendation (78 students) and Equal Opportunity (32 students) in early admissions round 2, and Special Education Candidates (32 students) and Equal Opportunity (32 students) special tracks in regular admissions.\\n\\nStudents wishing to apply to Sogang University should accurately, factually, and richly document their thoughts over the past three years and records of putting them into practice and activities. The type of person admissions officers want is someone with a positive and open worldview, social perspective, and life philosophy. This does not mean excluding people with critical thinking. Sogang University's educational goal is to cultivate people who possess hearts that view the world with open yet warm eyes. 02-705-8621, admission.sogang.ac.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4999, "output_tokens": 2243, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
{"custom_id": "article_751_1", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_01NqFZESunbAo9gSBgMPjWuG", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"[Fun Study] Edu Column/Extracurricular Activities Will Carry Greater Weight in Admissions Officer Selection Process\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Extracurricular Activities Will Carry Greater Weight in Admissions Officer Selection Process\\nHumanities track - English, Korean, Social Studies emphasized; Science track - Math, Science, English emphasized\\n\\nUniversities that were negative about introducing the admissions officer system until January have suddenly come forward saying they will increase admissions officer selections. Educational authorities, who had been actively encouraging the adoption of admissions officers, are now saying they will impose disadvantages if too many are introduced. To provide information for understanding the admissions officer system correctly for test-takers exposed to this confusion, I would like to offer the following.\\n\\nThe admissions officer system is a more detailed organization of content that has already been implemented in existing extracurricular admissions. It's not about doing something new, but about changing one's perspective. In particular, one must break away from the get-rich-quick mentality that doing just one thing really well, like TOEFL or academic competitions, can get you into your desired university.\\n\\nIn admissions officer selections, potential related to one's major or career path is important. The ways admissions officer selections differ from previous extracurricular selections are as follows.\\n\\nFirst, only official materials are not what matters. While previous extracurricular selections only utilized grades or materials received from high school, now activities from elementary and middle school are also reflected through personal statements, recommendation letters, and interviews.\\n\\nSecond, rather than one definite extracurricular activity, engaging in various on- and off-campus activities related to one's major is helpful. Also, there is a need to actively participate in off-campus activities rather than cookie-cutter on-campus activities.\\n\\nThird, it is advantageous to establish application plans for one's career path or department in advance. It is good to establish a definite career plan by the latest during one's first year of high school.\\n\\nFourth, the weight of personal statements has increased. There is a need to write personal statements in advance like writing a diary and continuously supplement them. Relying on hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] after becoming a high school senior is now meaningless.\\n\\nFifth, the weight of recommendation letters also increases. It is important to continuously consult about one's situation and build trust so that homeroom teachers or principals who will provide recommendations can understand one's strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nSixth, all records must be left in school records. It is important to manage future hopes and career paths consistently and to steadily engage in one volunteer activity. The student evaluation section by the homeroom teacher recorded at the very end of school records also needs to be carefully checked.\\n\\nSeventh, reading activities are a very important factor. When looking at potential, there is no better material than reading for measuring indirect experience. Some schools are already intentionally combining reading with school records [GPA] exams.\\n\\nIn admissions officer selections, the weight of school records overall will be lower than at present. This is because potential or the school's ideal human image is reflected in some form. Also, there is a high possibility that it will not be reflected by simple grades alone. In the case of mathematics departments, various factors such as raw scores and rankings in mathematics can be reflected more precisely.\\n\\nMajor subjects, especially major-related subjects, will be emphasized over all subjects. Humanities tracks will emphasize English, Korean, and social studies, while science tracks will emphasize math, science, and English, and there may be differences by department. However, depending on the school, there may be cases where school records become more important, so it is important to carefully examine admissions guidelines.\\n\\nFor preparing extracurricular activities, which are carrying even greater weight in admissions officer selections, it would be good to follow these principles.\\n\\nFirst, priorities must be set. Priority 0 is things related to CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] and school records. In the case of English, TEPS will likely be more advantageous than TOEFL. TEPS has the advantages of high similarity to CSAT and requiring less regular preparation time. Of course, if CSAT scores are not good and one must enter university through English, TOEFL should be prioritized exceptionally. In the case of mathematics, if preparing for the Korean Mathematical Olympiad (KMO), it is advantageous to focus on the first round, which helps with CSAT preparation.\\n\\nFor humanities track students, while studying Korean history for first-year school records and doing advanced learning to take the Korean History Certification Test would also be a good strategy. Korean Language Certification Test or economics competitions are also good.\\n\\nSecond is things related to one's major or career path. Third, it is good to start with things that don't require particularly much time for preparation. Volunteer activities, club activities, and leadership activities are advantageous to take care of since they must be done anyway while living school life. In the case of reading activities too, it would be helpful to establish curriculum-linked, major-related reading plans and read them bit by bit during spare time in terms of managing reading records in school records.\\n\\nLee Hae-woong, Director of Time Education Hyst College Entrance Research Institute\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3668, "output_tokens": 1214, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations criticizes as \\\"department store-style compilation of existing policies\\\"\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology finalized and announced hagwon education reduction measures on the 3rd. There were no major changes from the draft announced at the public hearing on the 21st of last month. As announced, the Ministry put forward a strategy to reduce hagwon education by significantly overhauling specialized high school admissions. The remaining measures were at the level of compiling already existing policies such as expanding school autonomy, subject classroom systems, and strengthening after-school programs, which the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations criticized as a \\\"department store-style compilation.\\\"\\n\\nWhat stands out as changing is science high school admissions. Starting from the 2011 academic year admissions that current 8th graders will take, science high schools will select half of their enrollment quota each through admissions officer screening (conducted July-October) and science creativity screening (conducted October-December). Accordingly, all science high schools must hire at least 2 admissions officers by August. To apply for admissions officer screening, students must receive recommendation from their middle school recommendation committee.\\n\\nA middle school principal in Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul said, \\\"To avoid controversy in the recommendation process, objective data is essential,\\\" adding \\\"In the end, the recommendation committee will look at math and science grades or academic competition results, so how could hagwon education possibly decrease?\\\"\\n\\nKim Se-won, who entered his 6th-grade daughter in the Korean Mathematical Olympiad last month, said, \\\"To compete with outstanding kids at science high school, we can't give up olympiad-level hagwon education from elementary school. If they tinker with admissions, it will only add new types of hagwon education.\\\"\\n\\nThere are many observations that hagwon education for admissions officer screening will also flourish. This is because there's a high possibility that competition to build up achievements will break out in order to submit various materials to admissions officers.\\n\\nIm Seong-ho, planning director at Haneul Education, a specialized high school admissions company, said, \\\"Even if the admissions officer system is introduced, another factor causing hagwon education costs will emerge,\\\" adding \\\"I'm concerned that in trying to catch hagwon education, we might commit the folly of catching national gifted education.\\\"\\n\\nConcerns are also being raised about the science creativity screening that evaluates creativity, problem-solving ability, learning adaptability, etc. through science creativity camps lasting more than a day. The Ministry announced it would benchmark the admissions screening currently implemented by KAIST [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]. The idea is to evaluate creativity and potential while observing experimental and inquiry abilities, project-solving processes, etc. However, among frontline middle schools and parents, there are many opinions that they will inevitably have to rely on hagwon education because they cannot know the specific evaluation format.\\n\\nFor foreign language high school admissions, modified forms of written exams are prohibited as per the draft, and the weighting of math and science school records is lowered. The Ministry additionally decided to improve English listening evaluations. The plan is to lower difficulty by having listening evaluations, which each foreign language high school has been creating individually, produced jointly. If consultations by metropolitan and provincial education offices are achieved, joint production with middle school teacher participation is expected to be possible starting from this year's admissions.\\n\\nA reporting reward system (nicknamed \\\"hakparazzi\\\" [hagwon paparazzi]) that gives money for reporting improper hagwon practices will also be introduced around December.

Regarding this, Teacher Joo said on the 9th, \\\"High school classes tend to become formulaic due to college entrance exams, but if you change the study methods, you can draw out students' interest.\\\"\\nTeacher Joo's after-school classes are very popular. Kim Jin-won (18), a third-year student at Jamsin High School, said, \\\"One day, to teach verbs that don't take prepositions, she created a story called 'A Soldier Dumped by His Lover' using only those verbs,\\\" and \\\"It was so interesting that I listened attentively, and I was able to improve my English grade without taking private tutoring even once.\\\"\\nCha Kyung-ae, Dean of the TESOL [Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages] Graduate School at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, who served as the head judge for this teaching competition, evaluated through her judging comments that \\\"Teacher Joo accurately implemented learning objectives and effectively motivated student participation.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2262, "output_tokens": 494, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

At the championship media day event held on the 29th of last month, Mobis coach Yoo Jae-hak said, \\\"Jeon Tae-pung shows more of his true value the more he plays. We need to cut Jeon Tae-pung's offensive contribution in half to have a chance of winning.\\\" KCC coach Heo Jae confided his concerns, saying, \\\"With Ha Seung-jin out due to injury, I'm pondering how to stop Ham Ji-hoon.\\\"\\nWanting to win is the same for any player on either team. However, for Ham Ji-hoon and Jeon Tae-pung, who face 'life turning points' just ahead, there are special reasons why victory is more desperately needed. Ham Ji-hoon, who is confirmed to play for Sangmu [the Korean military basketball team], will enlist on the 19th after the championship ends, temporarily leaving the professional stage. Ham Ji-hoon, who debuted in the 2007-2008 season, has twice experienced finishing first in the regular season and was selected as this year's regular season MVP, but has never experienced a championship victory. Ham Ji-hoon is determined to follow in the footsteps of team senior Yang Dong-geun, who shaved his head with a relieved heart after achieving the unified championship in the 2006-2007 season.\\nFor Jeon Tae-pung, the major life event of marriage awaits. Jeon Tae-pung will welcome Jane Mina Turner, one year his junior, as his life partner on May 29th in Los Angeles, USA. Turner came to Korea three years ago, before Jeon Tae-pung, and is working as an English hagwon instructor in Seoul. Like Jeon Tae-pung, Turner also has a Korean mother. Jeon Tae-pung, who first stepped onto the Korean stage this season, desperately wants to win in his debut year and present a championship ring to his May bride.\\nIn the first game held on the 31st of last month, Ham Ji-hoon smiled first, leading a comeback victory that overturned a 16-point deficit with his outstanding performance of 26 points and 8 rebounds.

However, after 10 PM when students flock to the site, video playback often slows down or cuts out frequently. The time required to download a 50-minute lecture file also takes much longer than internet lectures from hagwon education companies, causing significant complaints from test-takers. EBS stated \\\"there were difficulties in determining student demand\\\" and announced plans to expand servers. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology bears responsibility for announcing the CSAT-EBS linkage policy first without sufficiently establishing the infrastructure needed for internet lectures.\\n\\nPresident Lee Myung-bak emphasized the significance of EBS CSAT lectures last month, saying they would \\\"open a path for disadvantaged people who cannot receive hagwon education.\\\" The free EBS CSAT lectures have a light economic burden and will be particularly helpful for students in rural areas or from low-income families. Rep. Jung Du-eon of the Grand National Party, while acknowledging this point, argued that it \\\"triggers a new hagwon education market and conflicts with the normalization of public education.\\\" Quick-moving hagwons in Seoul have already created 'EBS summary lectures.' Hagwons are tempting students by asking, 'When will busy test-takers have time to read through all 100+ EBS textbooks and listen to all the lectures?' Some even stimulate anxiety by saying \\\"if all test-takers dig into EBS materials, the 30% that doesn't come from there will determine pass or fail,\\\" thereby attracting high-performing students.\\n\\nThe commotion surrounding EBS CSAT lectures stems from the government's misplaced educational policy priorities due to its obsession with 'catching hagwon education.' These side effects occur because the government is trying to limit CSAT question creation to within the scope of EBS CSAT lectures in order to achieve hagwon education cost suppression effects in a short period.\\n\\nEven if EBS CSAT lectures can partially suppress demand for hagwon education, if schools just play EBS CSAT lectures during class time and cling to EBS materials instead of textbooks, reducing the role of teachers and textbooks, then priorities have been reversed. The government leading the charge to promote 'free hagwon education EBS' is tantamount to shaking public education. The government should return even now to the major principle of reducing hagwon education by raising the level of public education.

Student H (12) who attends this hagwon said, \\\"I often don't understand why I have to solve difficult problems that don't even appear on school exams, but I have no choice since my mom makes me do it,\\\" adding \\\"I want to focus more on school studies from now on.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, counterarguments that \\\"this topic has already come up three or four times, so it lacks freshness\\\" are also substantial. An official from a college admissions consulting company said, \\\"It was 6-7 years ago when official English test scores like TOEIC and TOEFL were banned from foreign language high school admissions, but English hagwon education has increased even more since then,\\\" adding \\\"Students will continue taking academic competitions to prove 'this is how I studied' during interviews or when writing personal statements.\\\"\\n\\nSpecialized high schools and universities that need to understand student characteristics through student records are also dissatisfied.

A Ministry official said, \\\"We cannot legally force students not to write competition records in personal statements,\\\" adding \\\"We expect universities will also not reflect them in accordance with the policy intent.\\\"\\n\\nThere are also opinions that this is undesirable from an educational perspective.

Under this plan, awards from math and science olympiads that high-achieving students mainly participate in, as well as English debate competitions and creativity-related contests, cannot be recorded in student records.\\n\\nAt the root of such extreme measures lies the judgment that various competition awards lead to hagwon education. Indeed, hagwon education costs for academic competitions are expensive. Tuition for elementary student math olympiad preparation hagwons exceeds 1.2 million won [approximately $900 USD] for three months. There are expectations that this measure will help reduce hagwon education costs by preventing the proliferation of competitions without credibility and cooling participation enthusiasm.\\n\\nHowever, the very act of participating in various competitions and striving for good results provides students with new motivation and discovers hidden abilities and creativity. The Education Ministry's measure is equivalent to demanding that students not be given incentives for self-development. The government is obsessed only with 'reducing hagwon education costs' while ignoring the essence of education, which is developing the potential of future generations. The anticipated side effects are also significant. If competition award records cannot be recorded, universities and admissions officers will be at a loss about what to look at when selecting new students. There are also major concerns that students will instead flock to hagwon education for school grades and awards in school competitions.\\n\\nIt is understandable to pour out hagwon education cost reduction measures to ease the burden on the middle class and ordinary people.

It's a simple idea that as long as hagwon education is suppressed, it doesn't matter what happens to the essence of education.

The earlier you prepare, the wider the doors open\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"《U.S. universities began announcing their acceptance results starting in April. This year, Ivy League universities showed an average competition ratio of 10 to 1, including Harvard University's 14.5 to 1. What is the secret to opening the doors of U.S. university admissions that narrow each year? Since preparing for admission to prestigious U.S. universities requires a minimum preparation period of 2-3 years, one must prepare with accurate admissions information and systematic planning. Let's examine U.S. university admission requirements and learn about admissions factors and time-specific preparation methods.》\\n\\nWhat and how to study\\n\\n○ U.S. college admissions: School records are most important\\n\\nThe school records considered in university admissions are grades from 9th grade (3rd year middle school) to 12th grade (3rd year high school) or up to the time of application. Korean students submit their high school grades. Top-tier universities typically select students in the top 5-10% of school records, and depending on the university, they select students in the 10-20% or 20-50% range.\\n\\nWhen selecting courses to take, it's not good to choose only easy subjects to raise school records. As students advance to higher grades, it's better to structure classes around high-level subjects such as Honor classes, AP (Advanced Placement), and IB (International Baccalaureate). If grades in specific subjects are already low, students must make up for the low GPA by achieving high scores on SAT II, which are subject tests within the SAT. Even if grades are not good, if students show consistently improving grades, admissions officers also evaluate them as developing students.\\n\\n○ Extracurricular activities: Must maintain consistency from 3rd year middle school\\n\\nThe key to effective extracurricular activities lies in leadership and creativity. Students should consistently engage in two or three activities starting from 9th and 10th grades. Taking on roles like sports club leadership or student council president are also good examples of demonstrating leadership and diligence.\\n\\nStudents should identify their areas of interest and what they want to study in university, and from lower grades, they can participate in summer programs with high reputations in those fields or create their own clubs. The U.S. government, NASA, and many prestigious universities offer summer programs. There are many programs that not only high school students but also elementary and middle school students can participate in.\\n\\n○ SAT I: Must prepare from 1st year high school\\n\\nThe SAT is a test that evaluates the critical thinking skills and academic potential necessary to perform university-level work in the United States. It is divided into SAT I, which evaluates logical reasoning, and SAT II, which tests subject-specific knowledge. Typically, SAT scores determine the level of universities students can apply to. The ACT (a college entrance exam administered by the nonprofit organization ACT Inc.) is also a U.S. college entrance exam like the SAT. The ACT is a test that evaluates academic knowledge based on curriculum content. Even if students take the test multiple times, they can submit only their highest score. The SAT is administered a total of 7 times per year (6 times in Korea), but because the preparation period is long, students must prepare starting at least from 10th grade (1st year high school).\\n\\n○ SAT II: Must plan to obtain scores in 2-3 subjects\\n\\nSome prestigious universities require SAT II scores in 2 subjects, and some even require SAT II scores in 3 subjects. While not mandatory, submitting these scores when applying is helpful. Since some universities don't require SAT II scores, if preparation time is short, it's advantageous to achieve high scores on SAT I.\\n\\n○ TOEFL: High scores are helpful\\n\\nStudents whose native language is not English have their English proficiency evaluated through TOEFL scores. Early study abroad students and international school students are often exempt. If SAT I Critical Reading section scores are low, submitting high TOEFL scores is helpful.\\n\\n○ AP: Must study systematically according to test schedule\\n\\nAP is a system where high school students take college-level courses (selected from 37 subjects) and take exams administered by the nonprofit College Board, and if they receive 4-5 points out of a perfect score of 5, universities recognize those subjects as earned credits and refer to them in admissions screening. Because Ivy League universities require AP scores, in Korea, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy teaches AP subjects as regular classes, and various foreign language high schools teach AP subjects as after-school classes. The exam is administered once each year in May. Because it overlaps with SAT II subjects, it's efficient to take SAT II and AP in the same subjects.\\n\\n○ College application essays: Must connect themes with experiences\\n\\nStudents must write 5-6 essays as part of their admissions applications, including a 'Common Essay' that addresses common themes required by all U.S. universities and 'Supplement Essays' with different themes for each school. To leave a strong impression on admissions officers, students must connect essay themes with original experiences to unfold their stories. Essays should be written so that a clear picture emerges of what values the student holds after reading them.\\n\\n▶For detailed explanations, visit ezstudy.co.kr\\nJeon Se-ryeon, Vice Principal of Demidec Language Hagwon\\n\\n▼U.S. University Admissions System▼\\n\\nOnce applications are prepared, all that remains is to understand the U.S. university admissions system and apply strategically. The U.S. university admissions system is diverse beyond just regular admissions. Since most allow applications to more than one type of admissions track, it's good to understand each school's admissions system and apply strategically.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3992, "output_tokens": 1389, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Yangjeong High School, which ranked first in Yangcheon District, had the most Seoul National University admissions in the region last year. Only Gwangjin, Gangseo, Gwangjin, and Guro districts were exceptions.\\n\\nIm Seong-ho, planning director at Haneul Education, said, \\\"In a situation where information for school selection was insufficient, the only information parents could rely on was admission results,\\\" adding, \\\"Since the disclosure of major university admission results will accelerate further and CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) scores have also been disclosed, admission performance will have an even greater impact on competition ratios between schools.\\\"\\n\\nThe strong performance of science-focused schools is also noteworthy. Five schools—Mapo High (Gangseo District), Miyang High (Gangbuk District), Seoul High (Seocho District), Sindorim High (Guro District), and Yeouido High (Yeongdeungpo District)—took first place in their regions. Science-focused schools have more math and science class hours than general high schools but fewer than science high schools. Director Im explained, \\\"Excluding science high schools, there aren't many schools that students aspiring to science and engineering fields can choose from, so the existence of these schools can be seen as having had an influence.\\\"\\n\\nThe high school choice system, implemented for the first time last year in Seoul to complement the equalization policy, selects 20% of enrollment capacity in the first stage where students can apply to any school in Seoul, and 40% in the second stage where students can apply to schools in nearby school districts. The remaining 20% were forcibly assigned in the traditional manner considering residence, religion, etc.\\n\\n● The Power of Customized Education Programs\\n\\nKonkuk University High School, which ranked first in Gwangjin District, and Sindorim High School, which ranked first in Guro District, achieved regional first place by weaponizing unique education programs. Konkuk University High School succeeded in attracting students by promoting its 'Teaching English in English' program. Sindorim High School, which had the highest overall competition ratio, benefited from the principal's active promotion of excellent programs through grassroots efforts.\\n\\nMiyang High School, which opened last year, took first place in Gangbuk District. A Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education official explained, \\\"It opened within an apartment complex in a New Town area, and many students from nearby Samgaksan Middle School applied.\\\"\\n\\nThe three general high schools in Jung District had similar first-stage competition ratios with little difference: Gyeseong Girls' High at 1.7 to 1, Jangchung High at 1.4 to 1, and Hwanil High at 1.4 to 1.\\n\\n● Schools with High First-Stage Competition Ratios Also Have High Second-Stage Ratios\\n\\nThe average first-stage competition ratio by school was 4.3 to 1. Eighteen schools had first-stage competition ratios exceeding 10 to 1. The average second-stage competition ratio for these 18 schools was 6.1 to 1, which was 2.2 times higher than the overall average of 2.8 to 1 (excluding schools that failed to fill quotas). Fifteen schools had second-stage competition ratios exceeding 5 to 1.\\n\\nThe 58 schools with first-stage competition ratios exceeding 5 to 1 showed a tendency to concentrate in the 'hagwon education triangle.' Nowon District had the most with 7 schools, followed by Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho districts with 6 schools each. Songpa and Yangcheon districts followed with 5 schools each. In contrast, Geumcheon, Mapo, Seodaemun, Yongsan, Jongno, and Jung districts had no schools with first-stage competition ratios exceeding 5 to 1.\\n\\nBy district, Dongjak District had the highest ratios with 7.3 to 1 in the first stage and 3.1 to 1 in the second stage. Conversely, Jung District ranked lowest with 1.5 to 1 in the first stage and 1.3 to 1 in the second stage. Jung District faces a shortage of students due to urban hollowing-out phenomenon.\\n\\nOut of 196 schools total, 7 schools failed to meet quotas in the first stage, and 5 of these also failed to fill quotas in the second stage. A total of 29 schools failed to meet quotas in the second stage.\\n\\n● Support Measures Activated for Schools with Low Competition Ratios\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced support directions for the 29 schools that failed to fill quotas. The education office stated, \\\"In the high school choice system, the schools preferred by students and parents were mostly those operating unique education programs rather than schools with excellent educational facilities,\\\" and \\\"We will focus on software-centered, customized support for each school rather than hardware.\\\" The education office allocated a budget of 356 million won [approximately $267,000 USD] for this purpose.\\n\\nEach school will use this budget to operate 'admissions officer system preparation projects,' 'global leader education programs,' 'EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) internet lecture classes,' 'principle-based learning,' 'self-directed e-learning rooms,' 'annual 100+ hour English, math, and science camps,' among others.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has a policy of taking measures such as △reducing the number of classes △school conversion △school relocation for schools that fail to meet competition ratios for three consecutive years.

Pyeongtaek = Reporter Park Hee-chang\\n\\nAfter 25 days of serving as the 'voice' of the Cheonan ship missing persons' families, Lee Jung-guk (39) stepped down from his position as representative of the Missing Persons' Families Association on the 21st. On this day, the Missing Persons' Families Association changed its name to the 'Cheonan Ship Fallen Soldiers' Families Association.' The new representative position was taken by Na Jae-bong (52), father of Private First Class Na Hyeon-min who serves as funeral committee chairman.\\n\\nLee Jung-guk was praised for collecting diverse voices from about 200 family members of the 46 missing soldiers and persuading them at critical moments to lead them to important decisions. During media briefings, his sincere and logical speaking ability sparked curiosity about \\\"what he used to do for a living.\\\" When I met him that afternoon at the administrative information center of the Navy 2nd Fleet Command in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, he revealed that just a month ago he was an ordinary computer hagwon instructor. However, when the Cheonan ship sank in the waters off Baengnyeong Island in the West Sea on March 26th, his brother-in-law, Staff Sergeant Choi Jeong-hwan, also went missing. Two days later, the families of the 46 missing persons organized the Cheonan Ship Missing Persons' Families Association, and he became the representative.\\n\\nLee said, \\\"Agitator? Communist? I heard all kinds of things,\\\" and explained, \\\"At first I went into the family meeting as a stenographer, then somehow ended up writing and reading the statement, and became representative.\\\" \\\"On the morning of the 28th of last month, when they heard I was a computer instructor, they assigned me to type up the meeting contents on computer. Since the discussion was going in all directions, I said 'please speak in an organized manner' out of frustration, and that became the reason I took on the representative role.\\\"\\n\\nLee subsequently became the 'media window' for the victims' families. He was also a 'family window' in front of the media and the Navy. Lee said, \\\"It was most difficult when I had to make the families understand what we had agreed upon with the military,\\\" and \\\"I had to be careful in all aspects including word choice so as not to hurt our family members.\\\" He said the incident that remains most prominent in his memory was when he came forward to persuade them to stop rescue and search operations on the 3rd. Lee said, \\\"There was a lot of opposition, but I persuaded them by saying 'while trying to find our family members, we can't create more families like us, can we?'\\\" He said that after saying those words, he collapsed.\\n\\nWhen talk turned to his brother-in-law, his eyes reddened. \\\"My brother-in-law had completed his mandatory military service and came out to society in the middle, saying he wanted to utilize several related certificates he had, but I stopped him from doing that. I felt so sorry about that. I don't want to exaggerate, but I do feel responsible.\\\"\\n\\nHe hadn't been able to sleep properly during this time. There were times when he stayed up almost four nights in a row. He said that when his brother-in-law's body was returned, he stared blankly and thought 'this doesn't seem real.' Despite leaving his eldest child, who had peritonitis, at the hospital and overworking his body, he was able to endure thanks to other people.\\n\\nHaving put down this heavy burden, Lee said he feels \\\"refreshed yet wistful.\\\" Lee said, \\\"When I stepped forward as representative, I told the families 'let's do this transparently, quietly, and quickly,'\\\" and \\\"We are also Navy families, so we didn't want to fight with the Navy, and the government listened to many of our demands.\\\" He said, \\\"I hope our families' conduct becomes a precedent for responding to future incidents.\\\" He emphasized, \\\"The soldiers who died while conducting operations in dangerous places are true heroes and deserve sufficient honor.\\\" At the end of the interview, he requested, \\\"Please be sure to write that we are grateful to all citizens who worried about and prayed for the Cheonan ship victims and their families.\\\"\\n\\nWhen asked what he would do now, he laughed and said, \\\"Since I was fired from my instructor job for doing this work, I guess I'll have to look through the 'flea market' [job listings] starting tomorrow.\\\" Lee plans to take on practical work in the renamed Fallen Soldiers' Families Association.\\n\\nPyeongtaek = Reporter Lee Mi-ji image@donga.com\\nReporter Gang Gyeong-seok coolup@donga.com\\n《 News in the Spotlight 》\\n☞ IOC member Moon Dae-seong's secret marriage in Britain\\n☞ Missing persons' family representative: \\\"Agitator, communist... heard all kinds of things\\\"\\n☞ Arrested spy: \\\"If I meet Hwang Jang-yop [a high-ranking North Korean defector] by impersonating a relative, I'll kill him immediately...\\\"\\n☞ 'Advertising genius' returns to Hongdae [a trendy Seoul district], leaving behind New York success story\\n☞ Pirates: \\\"If you don't give 20 million dollars [approximately $20 million USD] ransom, we'll blow up Samho Dream\\\"\\n☞ Fishing float in anus... genitals exposed... shocking 'extreme birthday beating' of man in his 20s\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3718, "output_tokens": 1465, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Son's bright and outgoing personality was a great help during their travels, where they often had to rely on help from unfamiliar locals. Photo provided by Lee Seong-jong\\n\\nThe 27-year-old married couple Lee Seong-jong and Son Ji-hyeon, who live in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province [a city north of Seoul], traveled through Australia and New Zealand by bicycle from June 2007 to July 2008, and through 10 African countries from March to October 2009. The distance they covered on two wheels amounts to approximately 10,500km. The couple, whom we met on the 23rd, are preparing for another adventure this fall.\\n\\nThe husband Lee, who is essentially half-unemployed, wore a brown winter jacket zipped up to his neck despite the warm spring weather of 15 degrees Celsius. Contrary to expectations, he even had a belly. His wife Son, wearing overalls, had a youthful face with fair skin and a bright expression that wouldn't look out of place on a high school girl. To think that this veteran traveler couple, who had traversed jungles teeming with wild animals and crossed deserts, looked like people you'd commonly see at bus stops or on subways. But when we heard their story, there was something extraordinary within the ordinary.\\n\\n①Quick Decision-Making\\n=They started dating at the end of 2004 and took 222 days to get married. They decided to marry just 3 months into their relationship. At the time, Lee was a second-year mechanical engineering student at Chung-Ang University who had taken a leave of absence to serve as a public service worker, while Son had just graduated from Korea University's College of Health Sciences and gotten a job as a nutritionist. 'What's the point of dragging it out?' was their reason for the lightning-fast marriage.\\n\\n②Flexibility\\n=Both loved to travel and planned a long-term trip. Originally, they thought about a two-month backpacking trip through Europe, but considering cost-effectiveness, they became interested in bicycle travel. That would require about 2 years of travel. They prepared for a year with a route crossing China to Europe, collecting information and purchasing equipment. Their goal was to travel on $10 per day. While struggling with raising funds, just days before departure, they heard from a friend that Australia offered the possibility of earning money while traveling, and they flipped their destination to Australia like flipping a hotteok [Korean pancake].\\n\\n③Sociability\\n=Son told a reporter in his 40s, '32 years old? Wow, you're quite handsome.' Son's amazing ability to easily approach any stranger. For the couple who spent about 80% of their travel time camping in tents, Son's personality was a huge help. With Son's bright smile, locals willingly offered their front yards as camping spots. Police stations and churches were no exception.\\n\\n④Stubbornness\\n=After finishing their Australia and New Zealand trip, they tried to live an ordinary life. Lee emphasized his bicycle travel experience in job applications to large corporations, but was repeatedly rejected. Son said, 'We were shocked that such an incredible experience was of no help at all in getting a job.' From that point, the two developed a stubborn determination to succeed by combining travel with making a living. Choosing dangerous Africa as their second travel destination was also for this reason.\\n\\n⑤Survival Skills\\n=Before the Australia trip, Lee worked at anything available—private tutoring, hagwon instructor, construction site labor—to save travel money. He visited magazine companies out of the blue and secured promises for travel diary serializations. After arriving in Cairns, Australia, for three months the couple worked cleaning hotel rooms during the day and as kitchen assistants and waitresses at restaurants at night to save money. They also contacted equipment companies and received sponsorship for expensive bicycles during their Africa trip.\\n\\n⑥Optimism\\n=Adventure is uncertainty. They willingly threw themselves into it. Son remembered crossing the Mozambique border as the most nerve-wracking moment of their trip—an area where robbers and lions frequently appeared, with sandy ground that required dragging their bicycles for over 10 hours. But they overcame the crisis thinking that if they could just get past this section, nothing in the world would be difficult. Lee is still half-unemployed, but about a month ago he started a business planning trips according to people's budgets and procuring equipment for those who want to go on adventures. While income is still low, the couple laughed and said, 'Things are getting better and better.'\\n\\nAdvice from this couple for people who want to embark on long-term adventures but can't put it into practice: △If it's just a money problem, push through. New paths will open up. △Build outstanding experience in your current job so you can prepare to make a comeback even with a gap period. △Outdoor activities are the trend. There are plenty of ways to connect adventure itself to profit. △The personal growth gained from adventure is incomparably valuable compared to several years of work experience.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3775, "output_tokens": 1235, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The hagwon director is moved by a newspaper photo of a university president personally washing students' feet at a foot washing ceremony and decides to proceed with the same event at his hagwon. Gang-soe, a Korean language teacher, inadvertently takes charge of 'publicity and reporter recruitment.' The foot washing ceremony commotion planned at this supplementary hagwon to demonstrate 'an attitude of serving students' satirically mocks the reality of hagwon education that extends even to small provincial cities.

Twenty-somethings accustomed to conversations that attach profanity to every sentence ending.

Oh Eun-sun (44, BlackYak) is small. When standing next to Spain's Edurne Pasaban (180cm), who was her competitor for becoming the first woman to complete all 14 Himalayan peaks above 8,000 meters, she looks like a child. She has rarely heard herself described as tall since childhood. Her face isn't particularly pretty either. In a previous interview with this newspaper, Oh Eun-sun laughed and said, \\\"My nickname in high school was orangutan. My surname is Oh, and I looked similar too. At least I look much better now.\\\"\\n\\nOh Eun-sun was drawn to mountains from an early age. When she was in fifth grade, while on a family outing, she saw Insubong Peak in Bukhansan [a mountain in Seoul]. To the 11-year-old girl's eyes, it was a magnificent rock wall that became an object of longing she wanted to climb someday. She joined the mountaineering club in her first year of university and visited Insubong Peak in her second year. When she actually stood before the mountain, she was afraid. At first, she just watched the tent. Insubong Peak called to her again, and Oh Eun-sun began climbing the rocks.\\n\\nEven after graduating from university, Oh Eun-sun visited mountains on weekends. In order to go to the mountains she loved, she had to live even more diligently on weekdays. She worked various jobs including computer hagwon instructor, workbook teacher, and even ran her own restaurant. She said, \\\"I lived with pride in the fact that I earned my own living while going to the mountains.\\\"\\n\\nOh Eun-sun first connected with the Himalayas when she participated in the Korean Women's Everest Expedition in 1993. Unfortunately, she wasn't selected for the summit assault team. However, the eternal snow surrounding her in all directions captivated her body and mind. From that moment, the Himalayas became a wistful longing for Oh Eun-sun.\\n\\nIn July 1997, she climbed Gasherbrum II (8,035m) without oxygen, first inscribing her name as a climber of Himalayan peaks above 8,000 meters. Oh Eun-sun said, \\\"It was so difficult then that I decided I would never do high-altitude climbing again.\\\" Her resolution didn't last long.\\n\\nWhenever opportunities arose, Oh Eun-sun traveled to mountains around the world, including the Himalayas. In May 2004, she successfully climbed the world's highest peak, Everest (8,848m). Even at that point, Oh Eun-sun herself didn't know that this small-framed woman would become a figure attracting domestic and international attention in just a few years.\\n\\nIn December 2006, she became the first Korean woman to successfully climb the highest peaks of all seven continents, and in July of the following year, she became the first Korean woman to climb K2 (8,611m). After completing K2, she began dreaming of completing all 14 Himalayan peaks above 8,000 meters. In May 2008, she stepped on the summit of Makalu (8,463m) without oxygen. She said, \\\"Climbing Makalu was a major turning point.

For the 2009 academic year admissions as well, it was discovered that admissions officers at 6 universities simply conducted applicant eligibility screening to select 761 students, then reported this as admissions officer selection.\\n\\nThe admissions officer system is a system where admissions officers comprehensively evaluate students' potential, aptitude, and character from multiple angles to select students who match the university's ideal student profile or the characteristics of specific departments. In March of last year, the Ministry of Education sent a policy to universities stating that if admissions officers simply screen applicant eligibility or mechanically convert scores according to predetermined selection formulas, this would not be recognized as an admissions officer selection process.\\n\\nThe Board of Audit also discovered that three provincial education offices, including Gyeongnam Provincial Office of Education, violated the Ministry of Education's guidelines for improving foreign language high school admission systems and approved admission processes for 4 foreign language high schools that reflected TEPS and TOEIC scores that deviated from the middle school curriculum. The Board of Audit revealed that the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education took no follow-up action against 281 of the 422 hagwons caught operating without registration from January 2008 to August of last year.

We'll be there for a while.\\\"\\n\\nIf any mother wonders what karaoke with teachers is about, her child has probably already fallen behind. These days, at most schools, the main duty of the class president's mother is to host drinking parties and karaoke entertainment for teachers. Another mother from a different school district was shocked when she saw a homeroom teacher taking a phone call from a parent during their meeting and speaking informally, saying \\\"That's an improvement in grades, right?\\\" She wondered how close they must be for the teacher to speak so casually.\\n\\nI desperately want to believe this is just deviant behavior by some teachers and parents. However, with this year's university admissions officer system removing objective evidence like official language test scores and awards, and emphasizing subjective recommendation letters written by homeroom teachers, their cozy relationship-building will only intensify, not decrease. Now it's not enough to just give bribes [촌지] to teachers - parents have to worry about 'after-school entertainment' to keep them happy.\\n\\nSo the conclusion reached by mothers is that hagwon education is actually cleaner. If you send your child to a reputable hagwon, the instructor does their job worth the tuition without needing extra attention. Some even say that if they could send their children only to hagwons instead of schools where there's almost no choice, their education expenses would actually decrease significantly. Of course, it would be even better if like-minded parents could hire teachers with the same goals to teach their children.\\n\\n**Britain's Promise is Sweden's For-Profit Schools**\\n\\nThis is exactly the education reform plan of Britain's Conservative Party, which is likely to win the May 6th general election. Their pledge is to allow anyone - parents, religious organizations, or teachers - to freely establish schools, with the government providing the budget.\\n\\nWhile this might appear to be the extreme of Anglo-American neoliberalism, the model for this radical education reform is Sweden, the birthplace of social democracy. Since 1992, Sweden has reformed to allow not only parents but also for-profit organizations to operate 'free schools' with government funding, and this is considered successful. The Conservative Party emphasizes that students in marginalized areas have benefited the most by being freed from inferior public schools to attend schools of their choice. The core of these schools, which number 1,100 and serve 20% of middle and high school students, is choice and competition. The BBC even introduced them saying \\\"Sweden's free schools can pursue profits, so they can continue to strive for academic improvement.\\\" In our terms, this is essentially 'schoolification of hagwons.'\\n\\nPresident Lee Myung-bak visited EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] last month and said, \\\"Eliminating hagwon education is the government's goal.\\\" While it's true that hagwon education costs are breaking parents' backs, the government's obsession with eliminating the hagwon education market is no different from North Korea trying to eliminate jangmadang [markets]. The only countries that have attempted to ban hagwon education are dictatorships like our country under the Chun Doo-hwan regime, or Myanmar and Cambodia. When supply is monopolized, whether for goods or services, quality deteriorates, and when the public sector has a monopoly, corruption is almost inevitable. The same applies to education monopolized by the government. That's why the flourishing of hagwon education has become a global phenomenon.\\n\\nAccording to the research collection 'Hagwon Education: Phenomena and Responses' recently published by education scholars with government support, 81.2% of Taiwan's secondary students, 76.7% of Vietnam's, and 75.7% of Japan's receive hagwon education (Korea is 77%). This isn't just an Asian phenomenon driven by high educational fervor. In Greece it's 80%, Kenya 68.8%, and among developed countries, Israel has 62% and the UK and US have over 30% receiving hagwon education. Even the governments of Singapore and Israel provide support for hagwon education. Analysis using PISA [Programme for International Student Assessment] data showed that the average hagwon education participation rate in OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries was 34.4% for science and 46.4% for mathematics. The US National Association's '2009 College Preparation' materials distributed for college admissions counseling even stated that the effects of hagwon education are positive.\\n\\nIf hagwon education isn't just our abnormal phenomenon, then it's foolish for the government to pour limited resources and effort into eradicating hagwon education. Human desire to improve in any situation cannot be stopped by even the most capable government, I'm sorry to say.\\n\\n**Rather, Wage 'War Against KTU'**\\n\\nThe opponent this government should wage war against is not the hagwon education market but exists within public education itself. As long as we leave KTU [Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization] teachers who try to neutralize the government and its policies by giving perfect scores to all teachers in teacher evaluations, public education is bound to be completely defeated by hagwon education. As long as there are corrupt teachers who, relying on the iron rice bowl of teacher rights protected by KTU [Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization], accept bribes [촌지] and entertainment without any guilt, public education reform is impossible.\\n\\nIf education authorities don't know this reality, they're incompetent, and if they know but pretend not to, it's not an exaggeration to call them accomplices in educational corruption. Yet their recklessness in pushing forward the admissions officer system that emphasizes teacher recommendation letters is amazing. I'm truly fortunate that my child has been freed from being a 'hostage of the school,' so I can write this without worrying about teachers' reactions.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4033, "output_tokens": 1451, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Math is the most fundamental subject. Every year in university admissions, the math section shows the greatest gap in ability among test-takers. But one thing is certain: it's a subject anyone can excel at. Meeting a good guide is most important.\\\"\\n\\nSystem Math Co., Ltd., which has been developing math textbooks for over 10 years, launched its elementary and middle school math-specialized hagwon business this January under the brand 'Map Plus.' In just three months since launch, there are over 130 franchise hagwons nationwide. This is the result of tireless efforts by Choi Jong-gu, CEO of System Math Co., Ltd. (pictured), who took office in December last year.\\n\\n**Precise analysis of individual abilities like CT scans**\\n**Providing completely different customized textbooks for each student**\\n**Helping prevent repeated mistakes in weak areas**\\n\\nCEO Choi began restructuring System Math from early last year when he started participating in the company's management. What he pondered most was the company's vision. To find answers, he formed a task force team (TFT) centered around the System Math Research Association, which was the company's predecessor. Through this, they agreed to combine 'math' and 'online education.' They also incorporated the advantages of offline education methods that directly guide students. The result was the birth of 'Map Plus.'\\n\\nThe name 'Map Plus' combines the first letters of 'Math,' 'Analysis,' and 'Prescription' with 'Plus.' In other words, it means analyzing students' math abilities, prescribing solutions, and providing online services. It also embodies the will to serve as a reliable compass (Map) in math education.\\n\\n\\\"We focused our capabilities on building a math learning system utilizing online platforms. The existing method of unilateral teaching using standardized textbooks has limitations in providing customized education that considers students' levels.\\\"\\n\\nThe area he emphasized was 'how to assess each student's individual condition.' CEO Choi believed that simply distinguishing 'good' or 'poor' performance with scores like 80 or 90 points was not a valid approach.\\n\\nCEO Choi said, \\\"Even students with good math grades have weak areas,\\\" adding, \\\"I wanted to create a 'tool' that would help good students do even better and help struggling students do better than before.\\\" After about a year of effort, they independently developed 'e-CT' (education-Computerized Tomography).\\n\\nCEO Choi explained, \\\"e-CT is an online comprehensive assessment tool that systematically measures individual students' strengths and weaknesses by area and ability in math, just as doctors understand, analyze, and prescribe for patients' conditions through computerized tomography (CT) scans.\\\"\\n\\nEvery problem in e-CT contains hierarchical information such as grade level, unit, domain, ability, difficulty, and whether it's basic or advanced coursework. The content development team analyzed each problem individually and attached such attribute information. Usually, each problem has 20-30 pieces of attribute information. This information is used to analyze individual students' histories and present prescriptive learning.\\n\\nOnce the e-CT assessment is complete, analysis reports in table and graph format are provided so students' abilities and levels can be understood at a glance. The analysis reports show how one's math ability compares to national averages, top 30%, and regional averages. Detailed analysis and prescriptions by domain and ability are also provided.\\n\\nCEO Choi said, \\\"Textbooks will serve as treatment for the prescription.\\\" Map Plus provides two main types of textbooks: 'Individual Customized Textbooks' and 'Level-based Progress Textbooks.'\\n\\n'Individual Customized Textbooks' have different content, problems, and sequences for each student. For example, if a 4th-grade elementary student shows weakness in 'quadrilaterals and shape construction' on the e-CT assessment, that student's textbook will intensively feature lower-level concepts like the 'plane figures' unit from 3rd grade first semester and 'various shapes' unit from 2nd grade first semester. Conversely, if the student excels in this unit, it will be composed of 'perimeter and area of plane figures' and 'area and weight' units from 5th grade first semester. Additionally, each student's name and photo are attached to their textbook.\\n\\nLevel-based progress textbooks are composed of 5 levels. Considering the increasing proportion of descriptive and essay-type questions, they intensively reinforced completion-type, step-by-step, and descriptive problems.\\n\\nProblems in the textbooks have barcodes attached. When hagwon instructors find incorrect problems and scan the barcodes, information about each student's wrong answers is stored in the computer.\\n\\n\\\"You can check solution processes and correct answers using barcodes. Also, you can supplement weak areas through automatically completed wrong-answer notebooks.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Choi said he received many concerned questions about \\\"why start a franchise hagwon business.\\\" However, having experience successfully launching and leading YBM/ECC junior English specialized hagwons, his thinking remained unshaken.\\n\\n\\\"As a franchisor, we plan to transfer all the know-how needed for overall hagwon operations to franchisees. In other words, we will not only provide educational programs but also consult on all related matters including costs, location, scale, and establish promotional strategies.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Choi's goal is to establish one Map Plus near every elementary school nationwide. \\\"Public education and hagwon education [사교육] are the two pillars of education. While there are many negative views toward hagwon education, I plan to strengthen the positive functions of hagwon education that precisely identify and treat problem areas.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4180, "output_tokens": 1404, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

According to Sangji University on the 3rd, the Private School Dispute Mediation Committee (dispute committee) under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology held a plenary meeting on the 29th of last month at the Korea Research Foundation conference room in Yangjae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, and decided to appoint 5 out of 9 regular board members from the former foundation. The remaining board members will be filled by 2 university community members and 2 individuals recommended by the Ministry of Education. This would essentially transfer school management authority to former board chairman Kim Moon-gi.\\n\\nWhen this news became known, Sangji University community members came out in strong opposition. The Emergency Response Committee, composed of the student council, faculty council, staff union, and general alumni association, stated through a declaration: \\\"The dispute committee's decision is an anti-educational decision that directly goes against the people's desire to eradicate educational corruption\\\" and urged \\\"The government must correct the dispute committee's decision and prove before the people that its will to eradicate private school corruption is not empty words.\\\"\\n\\nThe student council decided to engage in partial class boycotts and sit-in protests on the 3rd, followed by complete class boycotts starting from the afternoon of the 4th. Faculty members also held a general faculty meeting that day and agreed to support the Emergency Response Committee's plan to visit Minister of Education An Byung-man to request a review of the dispute committee's decision. Professor Park Byung-seop, chairman of the Emergency Response Committee, said: \\\"If we legally allow the return of someone with a history of educational corruption, it would make meaningless the President's emphasized will to eradicate educational corruption\\\" and \\\"This is not just Sangji University's problem but a problem for all private schools, so we will do our best to ensure the dispute committee's decision is corrected.\\\"\\n\\nCivic groups in the Wonju area are also speaking with one voice against the former foundation's return. 21 civic groups and 6 political parties from the Wonju area held a press conference in front of Sangji University's main gate that day and issued a statement condemning the dispute committee's decision.

The current 17 listening questions (34%) out of 50 total questions will increase to 25 questions (50%). The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology's recent announcement is interpreted as intending to strengthen English education by shifting from grammar and reading-focused approaches to practical English centered on listening and speaking. Some parents are responding with concern that this might increase students' English learning burden. Some critics argue that this could actually encourage hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry]. However, before showing such sensitive reactions to education policy, the most important thing is for students themselves to build solid English skills that can respond to any changes.\\n\\nTo develop proper English skills, students need an attitude that recognizes English as a 'language.' This means viewing English not simply as a means to score points or as college entrance exam 'credentials,' but as a tool for communication.\\n\\nLanguage reflects a society's history and culture. If one learns a language without understanding this background, genuine conversation with people from that country becomes impossible. This is why students struggle to easily grasp an author's intent when solving English reading comprehension problems, or fail to understand context well in listening problems.\\n\\nFor example, consider the word 'full moon.' When we think of '보름달' [full moon], we recall images of ganggangsullae [traditional Korean circle dance] or rabbits pounding rice cakes. In contrast, English speakers conjure eerie images like 'vampires' or 'werewolves' from 'full moon.' This is because in the English-speaking world, the moon goddess 'Luna' is believed to emit energy that drives people mad. That's why the adjective 'lunatic' means 'crazy,' and the noun 'lunacy' means 'madness.' Understanding cultural backgrounds makes English learning much easier.\\n\\nTo build English skills, it's good to read literary works that clearly reveal the cultural consciousness of native speakers. However, rather than being overly ambitious, you should choose books appropriate for the child's level. English books not only help improve reading skills but also allow students to learn good expressions for speaking and writing, achieving a triple benefit. When discovering new vocabulary or sentences, students should read them three or four times while inferring their meaning from context. When using dictionaries, they should utilize English-English dictionaries whenever possible. English-English dictionaries help students become familiar with English language systems and have the advantage of clearly showing usage differences and meanings between English words. Using audiobooks with English tapes or CDs that read the content aloud can simultaneously develop listening skills. To improve a child's English ability, instilling interest and confidence in English is most important. Creating an atmosphere where children can enjoy English itself is the parents' responsibility. When this happens, the possibility of children experiencing confusion will decrease regardless of how education policy changes in the future.\\n\\nYoon Jeong-ho, EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) Foreign Language Instructor and Representative of Yoon Jeong-ho English\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3056, "output_tokens": 744, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

To avoid being intimidated, he carried around a 'New Concise English Dictionary' every day and was nicknamed 'Concise.' An opportunity came for him to show off. One day, his Korean language teacher asked during class, \\\"Does anyone know who the Minister of Education is?\\\" Students who had just entered middle school couldn't possibly know the Education Minister's name. However, the boy, encouraged by the teacher's hint \\\"Doesn't the minister's name appear in books published by the Ministry of Education?\\\", hurriedly flipped through his textbook.\\nSure enough, the Education Minister's name was written right there: 'Approved by Education Minister.' A few minutes later, this boy who had confidently raised his hand found himself disappointed amid the laughter of his teacher and classmates—a predictable outcome. This is a true story experienced by novelist Lee Soon-won.

Saying he has \\\"become accustomed to teaching,\\\" he recounts impressive classes that remain in his memory from elementary school through university. During elementary school, his homeroom teacher organized high-performing students into an 'inspection squad' and had them check the answers written on the blackboard by the remaining students, the 'gladiators.' The writer was part of the 'inspection squad.' Friends whose answers he judged incorrect had to be spanked by the homeroom teacher. One day, he misjudged a correct answer as wrong. Conflicted as he watched his friend getting it right, he mustered courage to confess: \\\"Teacher, I was wrong. I looked at it wrong. Moon-seok got it right...\\\" The homeroom teacher shouted: \\\"You bad boy, instead of helping your friend, you're framing him?\\\" The writer was severely beaten by the homeroom teacher while thinking 'I'd rather be demoted to gladiator class.'

After thorough preparation for one year, she proudly passed the entrance exam this year. This was thanks to her continuous contact with Australian friends she made at the camp to learn about English and foreign culture, completing her own learning portfolio, and carefully preparing English essays based on what she learned in Australia. This overseas English camp experience became a turning point that changed Student A's career path.\\n\\nRecently, the number of elementary and middle school students participating in overseas English camps in the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and other countries during summer and winter breaks is increasing every year. What exactly draws Korean students' attention to overseas English camps? And what is the purpose of sending them on overseas programs?\\n\\nEnglish is the top priority concern for many parents and students. Since English is emphasized in almost every process including special-purpose high school admissions, university admissions, and employment, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Korea is a republic of English hagwon education [in Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry].\\n\\nLet's look at the educational environment in English-speaking countries. Students say they have teachers, friends, and family members in schools and surrounding environments who give them positive thoughts and motivation for learning. Moreover, through public education, they can not only engage in sufficient self-directed learning but also develop independence and critical thinking skills.\\n\\nThe purpose of overseas programs is not merely to improve English proficiency. Overseas programs create knowledge backgrounds about the cultures of various English-speaking countries and English-using environments for students.\\n\\nDespite many educational policy attempts and efforts regarding English education in Korea, the phenomenon occurs where students' English proficiency hardly improves due to poorly established environments. Many hagwons are pouring out classes with native speaker instructors and online English learning systems, but English, as well as understanding and thinking skills about its culture, grow only when students actually think and use English in daily life.\\n\\nIn 1991, a foreign scholar once said: 'Immersion education in schools that use English is not as effective as intensive immersion education.' The reason, as can be seen in recent research results, is that when educational focus is simultaneously placed on linguistic aspects and content aspects of subjects, the process by which students acquire linguistic aspects becomes complex, and consequently, accurate second language acquisition can be negatively affected.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, the purpose of overseas programs is to help students find fun in English by directly listening, seeing, reading, and feeling in English in all aspects of life, thereby increasing their understanding of English, rather than simply studying for English learning.\\n\\nIf you thoroughly research during vacation periods, confirm what kind of overseas program suits the student, and prepare with English reading and consistent English diary writing until departure, it will become a more effective overseas program. If you add a clear sense of purpose, students will take their first successful step as global leaders through English proficiency improvement, motivation, and cultural experience.\\n\\nOh Jae-wook, CEO of Camp Korea.com Co., Ltd.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3098, "output_tokens": 774, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

No, it was once the final summit, but not anymore. Another summit floats above the clouds, unconquered. Students pour desperate effort into conquering this final summit called medical graduate school. They say it has been their dream since childhood. It was probably a dream planted from an early age by parents or close relatives who heard these students called prodigies. With the day to achieve their dream so close, with the final summit right before their eyes, wouldn't they run toward it even if it meant their last breath?\\n\\nI am not a good professor. However, I do try to instill passion in my students. Recently, I conducted in-depth interviews with about 10 students under my guidance. Some are freshmen who just entered university. Through our conversations, I discovered that students can no longer share their dreams with me.\\n\\nI was reminded of 'The School of Lies,' the grand prize winner of the Munhakdongne Children's Literature Award that I recently enjoyed reading. The school in the novel is a gifted school supported by the government to gather talented children and teach them techniques for more creative and magnificent lies to contribute to national development. It metaphorically expressed the brutality of the college entrance exam war and the school environment where students must be wary of each other, harbor jealousy, and even tolerate lies. The festival of lies repeatedly heard during university admission interviews, taught by teachers and encouraged by parents—in such a society, we university professors feel powerless. In a brutal battlefield, if being a more perfect deceiver could add even one point to the score, who would refuse!\\n\\nI am glad to have become a life scientist. And I want to gladly share my joy and passion for learning with students. However, I am not a good professor. I lack the exceptional skill to open the closed ears of students who have come to temporarily borrow the summit where I stand in order to dream different dreams and climb different peaks. They say, 'I don't really know. But I want to go to medical school first and see.' It's probably because they fear something might go wrong if they don't go where everyone else is rushing. Even students who truly entered the School of Biological Sciences out of interest in life sciences depart toward that final summit in the clouds.\\n\\nLast year, it became a social issue when not a single graduate from KAIST's Department of Life Sciences went on to graduate school. Seoul National University's School of Biological Sciences faces a similar situation. Of the 64 students who graduated from the School of Biological Sciences in February this year, only 15 went on to graduate school. What makes us more miserable than the low graduate school enrollment rate is the fact that 85% of students who did enter graduate school are actually defeated soldiers who failed the medical graduate school exam.\\n\\nIsn't this reality frightening and shameful—that if someone asks about the future of life sciences in this country, we must cry out to look up at these students? How can I deal with my foolishness in only now realizing why senior professors raised both hands in opposition when the medical graduate school system was introduced in 2005? I plead with Ministry of Education bureaucrats: please return things to how they were before 2005. Please don't let universities become arenas for lying competitions anymore.\\n\\nLet's face reality. The medical graduate school system was implemented starting in 2005, modeled after the system in the United States, considered an advanced educational nation, with the purpose of alleviating the overheating of the brutal college entrance exam war. Has the intensity of entrance exam competition eased after five years? It has only extended the exam period for high school seniors by four more years. The hagwon market has struck gold, and basic academic disciplines are collapsing. Medical graduate schools are a black hole that sucks in not only students majoring in basic sciences like biology, physics, chemistry, and earth science, but also students from pharmacy and engineering schools, and even liberal arts students. Is it only students being sucked in? Our country's future is being sucked in along with them.\\n\\nLee Il-ha, Professor, School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3415, "output_tokens": 976, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

While a careful reading reveals content stating that patent applications cannot guarantee admission to desired high schools and universities, misunderstanding and confusion are anticipated.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology introduced the 'Self-Directed Learning Admissions System' last December for international middle schools, foreign language high schools, international high schools, and autonomous private high schools in non-equalization regions. This is an admissions system designed to select students with creativity and potential based solely on school records [GPA] and interviews, eliminating the need for hagwon education. In the first stage, a certain multiple of the enrollment capacity is selected based on school records, and in the second stage, final successful candidates are selected by combining school records with interview scores. The first-stage screening for foreign language and international high schools reflects only English grades from the four semesters of 2nd and 3rd year middle school, while science high schools reflect only math and science grades. In the second-stage screening, an admissions committee composed of admissions officers conducts interviews based on study plans, teacher recommendation letters, and school life records to select final successful candidates. The main interview components are self-directed learning plans, volunteer and experiential activities, and reading activities. Self-directed learning plans evaluate major-related motivation including what sparked interest in the major and preparation, the process of self-directed learning, post-enrollment study plans, and career plans.\\n\\nChanges in the admissions system following the introduction of the Self-Directed Learning Admissions System can be largely categorized into three areas. First, elements that excessively encouraged hagwon education, which were problematic in international middle school and foreign language high school admissions, have been completely excluded. Special admissions tracks have been completely abolished. Not only written exams but also modified forms of written tests such as oral interviews asking about subject knowledge or aptitude tests are prohibited. Elements that encourage advanced learning—such as awards from external academic competitions that cannot be prepared for through normal middle school curriculum, certification test scores like TOEFL, TEPS, and TOEIC, and various professional certifications—cannot be used as screening factors or interview materials.\\n\\nSecond, provincial and metropolitan education offices' oversight of high school admissions has been strengthened. For foreign language and international high schools, admissions officers appointed by education offices directly participate in admissions committees to ensure fairness and objectivity in the admissions process. Third, to prevent the Self-Directed Learning Admissions System from being modified as it is implemented by individual schools, an annual 'High School Admissions Hagwon Education Impact Assessment' system has been introduced for continuous and systematic management.\\n\\nIn conclusion, specs created with the help of hagwon education will be of no help whatsoever in future admissions to international middle schools, special purpose high schools, and autonomous private high schools. Rather, they may have a negative impact when evaluating self-directed learning capabilities during interviews. Students can develop their capabilities by faithfully completing elementary and middle school curricula while engaging fully in diverse reading activities and volunteer experiences.\\n\\nKoo Ja-moon, Director of School System Planning Division, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2935, "output_tokens": 824, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

A classroom scene at Suwon Foreign Language High School. Dong-A Ilbo file photo\\n\\nWhat are the three changes starting from the 2011 academic year foreign language high school admissions? First, the number of students selected by Daewon Foreign Language High School and Gyeonggi Foreign Language High School has been reduced. Second, as schools select students through self-directed learning admissions, English school records have become the deciding factor in foreign language high school admissions. Third, students cannot apply to multiple departments simultaneously and can only be admitted to the department they applied for. How should foreign language high school admission strategies change for the 2011 academic year?\\n\\nStarting this year, foreign language high school admissions will conduct department-specific selections, and applying to multiple departments simultaneously is not possible. Also, since overlapping applications between foreign language high schools, science high schools, autonomous private high schools, and autonomous private high schools are no longer allowed, test-takers have only one application opportunity. Since the first stage of foreign language high school admissions selects 1.5-2 times the number of students based solely on English school records, test-takers must aim for perfect scores on their school English exams.\\n\\nTest-takers need to manage school records not only in English but also in major subjects and all subjects in preparation for the possibility of not being accepted to a foreign language high school. While foreign language high schools only consider English school records, science high schools, autonomous private high schools, and autonomous private high schools also consider school records in subjects other than English.\\n\\nIn this year's foreign language high school admissions, it is important to choose in advance the major foreign language in which one has talent and interest. Additionally, when writing study plans and recommendation letters, content about efforts or special talents related to the major foreign language should be written focusing on specific examples.\\n\\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announcement, various certification test scores and academic competition awards cannot be recorded in application documents. Therefore, school-based competitions and exams will inevitably be highlighted relatively more. Thus, it is advisable for test-takers to examine various school competitions, exams, and special activities and actively utilize them.\\n\\nRecommendation letters should be requested from the responsible teacher in advance to ensure they are written more specifically with content including concrete examples. The recommendation letter and study plan must be consistent. In the case of Seongnam Foreign Language High School, they plan to provide study plan editing guidance for prospective applicants during July-August, so students hoping to attend Seongnam Foreign Language High School must complete their study plans before summer vacation.\\n\\nSufficient materials related to △study plans △volunteer and experiential activities △reading activities △leadership activities should be secured so that documents can be prepared focusing on specific examples. Students must examine each school's document format and carefully record their learning process and results, achievements, etc., according to the format.\\n\\nAlso, since the main content of the self-directed learning admissions announced by the Ministry of Education is already included in university personal statements, recommendation letters, reading evaluation items, etc., it is advisable for test-takers to basically check the document evaluation items of the Ministry of Education and major universities.\\n\\nYu Min-su, Special Purpose High School Team Leader, Jongno Academy Seocho [branch]\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2900, "output_tokens": 832, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Avoid obsession with advanced study\\nBuild skills step by step for gifted education centers → international middle schools and special purpose high schools\\nMath play using manipulatives such as 3D shapes and dice helps develop elementary students' creative thinking skills. An elementary student is studying with the creative thinking math textbook 'FACTO' and math manipulatives. Photo provided by Time Education Co., Ltd.\\n\\n《Parents' interest in gifted education centers is growing year by year. In April, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announced admissions guidelines stating that all 25 university-affiliated gifted education centers nationwide plan to select students through 100% admissions officer screening. While Olympiad and competition awards can no longer be recorded in school records, the fact that students received education at gifted classes or gifted education centers can still be recorded, making gifted education centers a particular focus of interest among students aiming for international middle schools or special purpose high schools.\\n\\nIn the 'giftedness assessment,' one of the gifted education center admission processes, problems that evaluate creative thinking skills rather than traditional mathematical intellectual ability are primarily featured. Parents are curious about how to study to improve their children's creative thinking skills and what materials to use to prepare for admission to gifted education centers. Let's find clues to creative thinking education methods through Time Education Co., Ltd.'s creative thinking math content specialist 'Mathian Research Institute.'》\\n\\n[Tip 1] Don't be impatient about advanced learning\\nMost students rush to advance quickly through the curriculum. Students, parents, and teachers alike share this tendency. Many students think that elementary math is simply calculation-focused and that they just need to be good at substituting into formulas and calculating. However, it's important to remember that important mathematical concepts appear during elementary school. Elementary math absolutely requires concept-focused learning.\\n\\nLet's use first-grade level subtraction problems as an example.\\n\\nMost students and parents find it difficult to recognize the difference between these two problems. They think these are similar subtraction problems with only different expressions. The upper problem is the 'removal method,' asking about remaining butterflies when two fly away from seven butterflies, while the lower problem is the 'comparison method,' comparing the difference between six and two to ask which is more. The comparison method can be seen as an easier way to understand the concept of subtraction than the removal method. Since students usually solve subtraction using the commonly taught removal method, error rates increase when comparison method problems are presented.\\n\\nLet's examine how accurate conceptual understanding of subtraction helps in problem solving. The following problem is a type frequently featured in gifted education centers and competitions.\\n\\nStudents would typically draw the 30th stone and count the white and black stones. However, using the comparison method principle of subtraction makes the problem easy to solve. Comparing the number of white and black stones at each even-numbered position reveals that black stones are always one more. In even-numbered stone pyramids, if you think of one row of white stones and the row of black stones directly below as one group, each group always has one more black stone, so at the 30th position, there are 15 more black stones.\\n\\nConcepts are both simple and important. By building concepts step by step, mathematical strength to solve high-difficulty problems is developed. Remember that the basic concepts of math learned in the appropriate grade are more important than advanced learning.\\n\\n[Tip 2] Perfect from the start? It's okay to solve again!\\nWriting math problems all over the blackboard and explaining solution processes - this is a typical math class scene. However, this is not a desirable teaching method.\\n\\nCreative thinking skills are not developed by solving many problems perfectly. Even if solving fewer problems, it's important to spend sufficient time on each problem and have time to think. Whether the answer is right or wrong, thinking skills improve through that process.\\n\\nLet's use a parent and student as an example. A mother and child came for counseling at a math hagwon. The student who took the diagnostic test was quite smart. The parent said, 'I didn't teach anything special - I just bought my child a creative thinking textbook (FACTO) and graded it.' The parent didn't immediately show the solution process for problems the student got wrong, but had the student continue solving problems. After finishing the textbook, the student solved the wrong problems again from the beginning. On the second attempt, the student correctly solved 50% of the problems that were wrong initially. After finishing the textbook this way and solving problems again, this time the student solved everything except about 10% of the problems they didn't know initially.\\n\\nIt's very important to finish the textbook even if there are wrong problems. Also, additional problem-solving skills will be developed through that process. When having children solve wrong problems again, you can confirm that your child's problem-solving ability improves.\\n\\n[Tip 3] Become friends with math through play!\\nMany parents worry about children who can't sit still at their desks even for a moment. Lower elementary grades are when children aren't yet accustomed to studying at desks. At this time, creative thinking skills can be developed through games and manipulatives.\\n\\nPlay using manipulatives such as 3D shapes, dice, and magnetic tangrams helps develop spatial perception and reasoning abilities. Among these, let's look at 'pentomino,' a game made using blocks.\\n\\nPentomino refers to blocks made by connecting five unit cubes together. It's a compound word from 'pento,' meaning five in ancient Greek, and 'mino,' meaning piece. It's a method of creating various forms using 12 blocks of different shapes made by connecting 5 unit cubes. Various forms such as alphabets, penguins, camels, and roosters can be made. Through such play, children not only enhance mathematical reasoning ability but also find fun and interest in logical thinking. However, when using mathematical manipulatives, it's necessary to accurately recognize the child's thinking level and engage in activities appropriate to their level.\\n\\nHan Heon-jo, Director of 'Mathian' Creative Thinking Math Research Institute, Time Education Co., Ltd.\\nAuthor of elementary creative thinking math textbook Mathian 'FACTO'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4480, "output_tokens": 1449, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

However, this cannot shake the 'intense studying' of test-takers preparing for college entrance exams.\\n\\nSeoul National University has disclosed the selection criteria for its admissions officer system for the first time. This is quite significant because starting this year, the number of students selected through this system has increased to about 1,100, which is 35% of the total, and Seoul National University's criteria are likely to become a model for other universities.\\n\\nLooking at the content introduced on the admissions website, we can see that there have been quite a few 'misunderstandings' about the admissions officer system so far. Rumors that grades don't matter or that being good at just one thing is enough were also wrong.\\n\\nAbove all, we need to clearly understand the goal of Seoul National University's admissions officer system. The goal of this system is to discover students who have grown within the framework of public education, based on trust in school education. Therefore, school records cannot be ignored.\\n\\nHowever, if a student from a rural area received a 70 in English, and a student who attended school in an English-speaking country received a 90, the rural student might receive a higher evaluation. This would be the case if it's proven that this student attended school classes diligently, asked teachers questions to an annoying degree, and made maximum efforts within given conditions by participating in advanced learning groups or club activities.\\n\\nSeoul National University also revealed that the rumor about needing to build separate 'specs' outside of school is wrong. This is because focusing on specs could actually make school life less sincere.\\n\\nAdmissions officers will carefully examine not only students' academic ability but also their 'potential ability' to become competent talents in the future. In other words, they look at how intensely students have contemplated their future and how faithfully they have prepared.\\n\\nThese are aspects that parents or hagwon education institutions cannot do on behalf of students. Even if wealthy parents take their children to expensive hagwon education institutions to do it for them, we hope Seoul National University admissions officers will see through this. Only then can the admissions officer system truly establish itself as a system for future talents and universities.

Let's look at the 'Elan-Soma Singapore English Camp' conducted by Time Education Co., Ltd. at Canadian International School (CIS) in Singapore. This camp, jointly hosted by Time Education's Elan language hagwon and creativity math specialist Soma hagwon, is conducted in the form of living at and attending regular classes at CIS, which is considered one of the world's leading international schools.》\\n○ Is your introverted child? English camp builds confidence!\\n'Elan-Soma Singapore English Camp' is conducted at CIS, a Canadian international school that teaches the Ontario, Canada curriculum.\\nCamp participants live there and attend regular classes together with enrolled students. After morning regular classes conducted in English, they attend intensive English classes at the local Elan language hagwon in Singapore. Classes cover various topics such as drama, science, arts, and literature to increase students' interest.\\nSmall group discussion classes are designed so that even students with introverted personalities can participate well. Han Jeong-ah, director of Elan language hagwon who planned this camp, said, \\\"We made it possible to complete in a 4-week intensive camp what would take at least 6 months if the same program were conducted in Korea.\\\"\\nWhile improving English skills is important, it's also important to motivate children to study on their own. Children must find English fun and interesting for them to continue studying English even after the camp ends.\\nAll after-school programs and weekend activities of the 'Elan-Soma Singapore English Camp' are designed to spark students' interest and provide motivation.\\nDuring drama classes, students analyze popular dramas and act in English as actors. There's also a program where they become journalists, conduct interviews, and write articles in English. They also select books appropriate to their level, read them, and then discuss the book's content with native-speaking teachers. Students learn how to structure writing in English while using English expressions they read in books and summarizing plots.\\nThey assess students' English levels in advance with native-speaking instructors to organize classes and ensure that students don't feel intimidated during class time due to insufficient English skills. Considering that Singapore is a bilingual environment using both English and Chinese, Chinese teachers are assigned so students can also learn Chinese during the camp period.\\n○ One life instructor per 5 students takes responsibility for 24-hour safety!\\n[Large view]\\nThe most concerning factor when sending children to overseas camps is safety issues. At the 'Elan-Soma Singapore English Camp,' one life instructor is assigned per 5 students to monitor their daily life 24 hours a day. Students' daily life is regularly updated through the website, and parents can check from home. Each week, students' photos are edited so parents can see what their children learned at school, what activities they participated in, and what after-school programs they joined.\\nHigh-end apartments are used as dedicated accommodations. Following the principle of two students per room, 5 students use accommodations with 3 rooms, a living room, a kitchen for cooking, and bathrooms. One life guidance instructor is assigned per accommodation unit. Life instructors don't simply manage and supervise daily life but guide students through the 'Self-Directed Learning Habits Development Project' to spend one hour before bedtime checking and supplementing their own learning status.\\nDirector Han said, \\\"The most important point in developing self-directed learning habits is the ability to manage one's own learning and time,\\\" adding, \\\"There's no better opportunity than summer camp for learning how to manage time independently all day while separated from parents.\\\"\\nBong A-reum, Reporter erin@donga.com\\n■ \\\"Our introverted child came back as an English chatterbox\\\"\\nElan-Soma Singapore\\nSummer Camp Q&A\\nQ.

Reporter Lee Won-ju takeoff@donga.com\\n\\n\\\"Now, here is hand, and here is leg.\\\"\\n\\nOn the 27th of last month, at an apartment in Jangji-dong, Songpa District, Seoul, Lee Ji-min (37, female) laid three six-year-old children on large paper and traced their body shapes while saying this. When drawing hands with crayons, she said \\\"hand,\\\" and when drawing legs, she said \\\"leg,\\\" and the children loudly repeated after her. Lee's son Seong Jeong-mo, Kim Yong-woo's (41, female) son Seo Dong-won who lives nearby, and Kim Mi-ra's (35, female) daughter Kim Da-young gather once a week to learn English from their mothers like this. The three mothers participate in the 'cooperative child-rearing program' implemented by Songpa District's Garak Social Welfare Center, taking turns teaching the three children once a week.\\n\\n○ Learning while playing with mom\\n\\nCooperative education is a program where 3-4 parents living in the same neighborhood form a team to provide necessary education including English to children. Garak Social Welfare Center has been gathering parents to participate in this program and forming teams every early year since 2006 with the purpose of reducing early childhood hagwon education costs. Now parents often form teams themselves and apply to participate. Participants in this program can receive 20,000 won [approximately $15 USD] monthly as operating expenses and also receive booklets collecting excellent cases written by people who previously participated in the same program.\\n\\nLee and two others formed their own team. The connection was that all three children attended the same language hagwon until the end of last year. Kim Yong-woo said, \\\"When I asked what they learned after coming back from the language hagwon, my child barely remembered the class content,\\\" adding \\\"I thought it would be better for me to teach myself, so I decided to participate in the cooperative program.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, they decided to change the method of teaching children. They established a 'principle' of teaching all classes like play. When teaching the English word 'roll,' the 'mom teacher' and children rolled around together on the wooden floor. When teaching the children's English storybook 'Ginger Bread Man,' they even set aside a whole day to bake cookies in the welfare center kitchen while learning vocabulary. The mothers frequently meet to exchange opinions to find teaching methods suitable for children. They look for internet websites helpful for early childhood education together and sometimes have discussions at playgrounds they follow their children to. When there are lectures helpful for child education, they make time to go learn together.\\n\\nChildren who learned while playing naturally reviewed what they learned that day without anyone telling them to. Lee explained, \\\"On days they learned songs, they kept singing the songs they learned, and on days they read English stories, they started reading those books from that evening, holding onto them.\\\"\\n\\nActually, even after class ended that day, the children read English storybooks and sang English songs while being held in their mothers' arms. The effects became much better while the hagwon education cost burden was greatly reduced. Until last year, they spent about 150,000 won [approximately $115 USD] monthly on hagwon fees, but now they have no hagwon education costs at all except for sending them to kindergarten.\\n\\n○ Unexpected benefits too\\n\\nKim Mi-ra said, \\\"While children receive cooperative education, they are learning many other things besides English.\\\" First is etiquette. Because they visit friends' homes in turns, children first learn how to politely greet their friends' mothers when entering homes. They also naturally learned that they must say \\\"thank you\\\" when receiving snacks. It's also beneficial that Seong, Seo, and Kim became closer friends by spending more time together than with other friends.\\n\\nThere are also benefits that parents haven't discovered. Welfare center social worker Myeong Su-jin explained, \\\"Seeing their mothers teach with confidence, children come to feel respect for their parents.\\\" However, when first starting cooperative education, attention is needed as gatherings often collapse due to opinion conflicts between parents. If cooperative education is discontinued in a short time, there are no educational effects and there are great concerns that children will feel confusion. For detailed information about cooperative education, inquiries can be made to the welfare center (02-449-2342).\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3787, "output_tokens": 1196, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Just because they won the election doesn't mean education superintendents can implement all their campaign promises. Some content may fall outside the superintendent's authority. We examined what can and cannot be changed through a Q&A format, focusing on the pledges of Kwak Nohyeon, Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education superintendent-elect.\\n\\nQ. The progressive camp opposes international middle schools and foreign language high schools. What will happen to these schools?\\n\\nA. During his campaign, Kwak indicated he would cancel the designation of specialized schools like international middle schools and foreign language high schools or convert them to other school types. School type designation is within the superintendent's authority, so they can be eliminated. However, he maintains that current students will not be harmed and radical changes will be avoided. There will be no additional designations.\\n\\nQ. There are plans to introduce complete lottery systems for autonomous private high schools and change foreign language high school admission processes...\\n\\nA. Autonomous high school admission processes cannot be changed by the superintendent alone. According to law, consultation with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is required. For foreign language high schools, principals create admission guidelines that require superintendent approval. The superintendent can modify them to fit their educational philosophy. The same applies to international middle schools.\\n\\nQ. Kwak criticized autonomous high schools for having too many Korean, English, and math classes...\\n\\nA. Autonomous high schools have autonomy in curriculum organization. This is determined by the principal and falls outside the superintendent's authority. Without the principal's agreement, class hours cannot be arbitrarily changed. Also, while Kwak said he would cancel autonomous high school designations for schools violating designation conditions and related laws, the law prohibits cancellation for 5 years after designation. Autonomous high schools can be maintained for at least 3-4 years.\\n\\nQ. What will happen to the high school choice system?\\n\\nA. The high school choice system is within the superintendent's authority, so Kwak can abolish it. In this case, there's a high probability of returning to the previous system of mandatory assignment to schools near one's residence. If a desired school is far away, families would need to move near the school. Current 9th graders will not be affected. The scope of choice and assignment methods are undecided. Kwak's opinion is to create excellent schools everywhere so students don't need to go to distant schools.\\n\\nQ. Will university preparation methods change?\\n\\nA. Changing the university admission system is not the superintendent's role. University admission methods are determined by the Korean Council for University Education. However, the superintendent can determine high school curricula for university preparation. Kwak is considering ways for not only teachers but also local communities to actively participate so students can adapt to the admission officer system. The plan is to create community-type networks to minimize hagwon education influence. He also has opinions about strengthening descriptive assessments. The plan is to conduct regular classes based on mutual cooperation and discussion.\\n\\nQ. Will academic achievement assessments be eliminated?\\n\\nA. Implementing National Assessment of Educational Achievement is not mandated by law. The superintendent can give schools autonomy. However, Kwak doesn't oppose the purpose of assessing underachieving students itself. He opposes the ranking-style operation when schools have different facilities and circumstances.\\n\\nQ. What are innovative schools and how will they operate?\\n\\nA. Innovative schools are the core of Kwak's key pledge of 'responsible education that doesn't give up on a single person.' Innovative schools reduce class size to under 25 students and have dedicated teachers responsible for educating underachieving students. Kwak plans to establish 300 innovative schools (150 elementary, 150 middle and high schools) in Seoul during his term. Currently, they will be designated starting with underdeveloped areas in connection with the 'Education Support Priority District Project.' Innovative schools operate with creativity, humanity, and career aptitude education as their basic philosophy. However, since regular schools themselves are designated as innovative schools, advancement to higher-level schools is no different from other schools.\\n\\nQ. Will zero-period classes and evening self-study be prohibited?\\n\\nA. Kwak plans to enact a 'Student Rights Ordinance' currently implemented by Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education. According to this ordinance, zero-period classes and mandatory evening self-study are prohibited. The superintendent can submit an ordinance bill to the city council, and if the council passes it, they can be prohibited. Since Democratic Party city council members won a majority in this local election, the likelihood of passage is high.\\n\\nQ. Is it problematic for private hagwons to participate in after-school programs?\\n\\nA. Kwak has no plans to restrict private hagwon participation in after-school programs. His opinion is that there's no problem since they teach specialty areas in arts and physical education that schools cannot cover at low cost. The 'community network' that Kwak pledged uses all resources that can provide new learning to students. This includes hagwons. Particularly for educational welfare priority areas, there are also plans to issue vouchers to send students directly to hagwons.\\n\\nHwang Kyuin, Reporter kini@donga.com\\nChoi Yena, Reporter yena@donga.com\\n\\n■ \\\"Will Eliminate Poor Schools\\\"\\n\\\"Need to Mix with Rich Schools\\\"\\nKwak Suggests School District Adjustments\\n\\nSeoul Metropolitan Office of Education superintendent-elect Kwak Nohyeon visited A Middle School in Seoul's Gangseo-gu [a district in western Seoul] on the 4th and indicated he would adjust school districts if necessary to resolve educational gaps between social classes.\\n\\nAfter hearing from the school that \\\"60% of students are from low-income families and nearby elementary schools have nearly 100% children from low-income families, earning the stigma of being poor schools,\\\" Kwak said, \\\"There's a need to mix schools in these areas so that classes and social strata are not separated but can blend like a melting pot.\\\" A major road in front of A Middle School divides relatively affluent areas from low-income areas.\\n\\nKwak promised to find solutions for the phenomenon where some apartment complexes are divided into 'rich schools' and 'poor schools' by building, adding, \\\"In the United States too, there are cases where (students from poor areas) are not sent to nearby schools but are bused to (distant schools).\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4546, "output_tokens": 1615, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Got into Seoul National University's Pre-Med Program\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"About 600 parents attended the '2011 Early Admissions Application Strategy Analysis Briefing' held by Time College Entrance Research Institute on the 25th of last month, showing keen interest in early admissions processes. Photo provided by Time Education Co., Ltd.\\n\\nAs the 2011 academic year early admissions application period approaches, many test-takers are wondering which universities to apply to. Looking at the 2011 academic year admission processes recently announced by major universities, early admissions selections account for more than half of total recruitment. Early admissions selections have steadily increased every year, exceeding 60% for the first time this year. With cases like Yonsei University increasing its early admissions ratio to 80%, early admissions has now become essential rather than optional for test-takers.\\n\\nHowever, since each school has different admission processes and selection requirements change every year, test-takers applying for early admissions face considerable confusion. The admissions research institute operated by comprehensive education company Time Education Co., Ltd. offers specialized college entrance consulting services including regular and early admissions applications, providing personalized consulting tailored to changing admission systems. We heard about step-by-step strategies for early admissions success from Director Choi Seong-su, the lead consultant at Time College Entrance Research Institute who has been guiding college admissions for over 10 years.\\n\\n[Early Application Step 1]\\nStep 1: Choose admissions track after accurate diagnosis of one's abilities and situation\\n\\nMost importantly, before selecting an admissions track, one must make an accurate diagnosis of their situation. Only then can they choose universities favorable to them. For this, one must accurately understand their abilities, including school records [GPA]. One should first consider whether student record-focused tracks or essay-focused tracks are more advantageous, then examine universities afterward.\\n\\nThere are various types within both student record-centered and essay-centered tracks. After identifying one's strengths and weaknesses, one should choose the most advantageous track among school record-focused, essay-focused, and special talent tracks, and understand the additional characteristics these tracks possess. For example, one must carefully examine whether school record-focused tracks also reflect extracurricular areas, or whether essay-focused tracks consider CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] minimum grade requirements.\\n\\nThe Golden Rules of Early Admissions Success That Can Create Paths Where None Exist\\nAbility Diagnosis + Track Selection → Customized Study Plan → University-Specific Test Preparation\\n\\n[Early Application Step 2]\\nMust establish study plan suited to admissions track and target department\\n\\n[Enlarge]\\n\\nOnce an admissions track is selected, one must carefully examine the selection requirements that track demands and create a study plan accordingly. This is because university recruitment guidelines change slightly each year according to newly introduced tracks. For example, Seoul National University's 2011 Regional Balanced Selection track selects twice the number of candidates based solely on student record academic grades in the first stage, then conducts admissions officer screening in the second stage. Additionally, Seoul National University announced it would select students faithful to classes within school boundaries rather than those with so-called flashy 'specs' like contest awards in its admissions officer system. Understanding such university policies and establishing study plans accordingly is important.\\n\\nSchool records [GPA] management requires identifying in advance the grades demanded by target universities and the subjects reflected by academic field in student records, then managing accordingly on a regular basis. If student record grades are not heavily reflected, strategies focusing on external competitions or activities may also be necessary. Regarding CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores, the number of universities applying CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] minimum academic standards in 2011 early admissions increased from 70 to 97. Therefore, even when applying for early admissions, it's good to prepare steadily for CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam].\\n\\n[Early Application Step 3]\\nMust prepare for changes in problem types for university-specific tests like essays, interviews, and aptitude assessments\\n\\nOne important change in 2011 early admissions tracks is the expansion of university-specific tests such as essays, interviews, and major aptitude tests. For essay tests, humanities tracks feature integrated interdisciplinary essays combining language and social studies areas, while natural science tracks feature integrated interdisciplinary essays combining mathematics and science inquiry areas.\\n\\nFor humanities tracks, while all departments take the same essay exam, interview tests frequently include questions about subject knowledge related to the applied department, so preparing for this is also important. Students preparing cross-field applications should confirm the format and content of university-specific essay tests and apply according to their strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, it's necessary to understand each university's tendencies through past essay and oral exam questions from the universities and departments one applies to, and select admissions tracks advantageous to oneself. Additionally, one must prepare basic subject knowledge about desired departments during spare time to increase chances of acceptance.\\n\\nReporter Park Eun-jeong ejpark@donga.com\\n\\n19 Admissions Experts Deploy, Refreshing Early Admissions Consulting at Time Education\\n\\nThe admissions research institute operated by comprehensive education company Time Education Co., Ltd. has launched college entrance consulting services specialized in early admissions based on data analyzing early admissions tracks over the past 10 years. The research institute has a total of 19 college admissions experts.\\n\\nKey consultants include △Director Choi Seong-su, former director of Seoul Gangdong [an eastern district of Seoul] Cheongsan Hagwon (now Gangdong High-ST) College Entrance Research Institute △Director Lee Soon-won of College Entrance Planning, a founding member of Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Daesung Hagwon known as a social studies instructor △Director Lee Ji-yeol of Admissions Analysis, who served as head of admissions analysis at Ilsan Pureun Hagwon and has been overseeing college entrance analysis at Time Education since last year △Advisory Committee Member Lee Hae-ung, who served as director of Daechi [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] Eureka and is the author of 'Study Methods for Middle School Students Preparing for Prestigious Universities,' currently serving as director of Time Education's Medium and Long-term Learning Plan Research Institute.\\n\\nTime College Entrance Research Institute provides services specialized in consulting students' early admissions applications. That is, hagwons that have long guided early admissions applications focusing on current students and essay/oral exam preparation hagwons are connected to share know-how while providing accurate consulting for current students' early admissions applications. For this purpose, they collect and accumulate data through High-ST, Future Research, Yeseom Hagwon, Eureka Hagwon, Choi Nak-jun Essay Writing, and other regional institutions linked with Time Education. For more accurate consulting, collected data undergoes continuous revision and supplementation work, including independent analysis by Time College Entrance Research Institute.\\n\\nFor regular admissions consulting, they provide consulting through analysis of top-tier students' psychological flow patterns, going beyond the level of creating placement charts based on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] score analysis. For this purpose, consultants and advisory committee members who have guided top-tier students in each region understand test-takers' psychology to create admission application guidelines that accurately identify 'where one can go' and 'where one should go.'\\n\\nDetailed information about consulting is available on the Time College Entrance Research Institute website (consulting.t-ime.com) or by phone (02-3288-3550).\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4660, "output_tokens": 1834, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This stems from dissatisfaction with their current university life or feeling that their major doesn't match their aptitude. However, students who decide on a half-year retake don't feel at ease. They fear, 'Can I compete with high school seniors and repeat test-takers [students retaking CSAT after high school graduation] by studying for less than six months?' Moreover, anxiety creeps in: 'What if I spend money on a half-year retake and fail?' For these reasons, some students attempt half-year retakes without their parents' knowledge.\\n\\nMr. Lee (19), who lives in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, attends K University in Seoul. During high school, Lee's school records averaged grades 1 and 2. However, on the day of CSAT, perhaps due to nervousness, Lee arrived at the test site having left his glasses at home. Lee recalled, \\\"I don't even remember how I took the test.\\\" As expected, his CSAT scores dropped by mostly one grade level in each subject area compared to his high school performance. Whenever the university he had dreamed of throughout high school came to mind, Lee felt somehow shabby.\\n\\n\\\"When I saw students wearing T-shirts or jackets with the name of the university I had targeted, I felt very envious. Each time, I became more determined, thinking 'I must try again.'\\\"\\n\\nWhen Lee mentioned \\\"I want to retake\\\" early this year, his parents opposed it. Their reaction was \\\"Is there really a need to retake?\\\" When Lee recently declared \\\"I want to start a half-year retake now,\\\" his parents reacted the same way.\\n\\n\\\"I thought it would be better to spend the time I'd need to convince my parents studying more for CSAT instead. If I show them a September mock exam report card with all grade 1s in Korean, math, foreign language, and social studies, wouldn't my parents understand then? Doing well on the September mock exam is most important.\\\"\\n\\nLee devised a meticulous(?) plan to prevent his parents from noticing his half-year retake for the time being.\\n\\n\\\"If I quit my private tutoring part-time job too, my parents might suspect something, so I plan to continue tutoring for now. Instead, I'll prepare more diligently for tutoring sessions and use that to help with my half-year retake.\\\"\\n\\nHow will he cover the costs of the half-year retake, such as online lectures and purchasing problem books?\\n\\nLee said, \\\"I'll handle it with money earned from part-time work, and if that's not enough, I'll lie to my parents saying 'I need to attend a hagwon to prepare for the international trade specialist certification exam' to secure funding.\\\"\\n\\nUnable to take a leave of absence 'openly,' Lee plans to strategically structure his second semester class schedule for a successful half-year retake. He plans to keep Mondays and Fridays free and concentrate classes only on 'Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.' He also plans to register for cyber lectures taken online to reduce the number of times he goes to school. If things go according to plan, he can study for CSAT in 'test-taker mode' like during his senior year of high school for four days a week: 'Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.'\\n\\n\\\"Although I'm doing a half-year retake secretly from my parents, I plan to study hard so as not to disappoint them.\\\" (Lee)\\n\\nMr. Choi (19), who lives in Dongjak-gu, Seoul, lives in a dormitory at a provincial university. Choi is dissatisfied not with the school but with his major. The very fact that he spends time in a department completely unrelated to his dream of majoring in journalism and broadcasting was unbearable for Choi. After CSAT last year, he told his parents \\\"I'm considering whether to retake,\\\" but his parents opposed it, saying \\\"You sleep a lot and have weak willpower, so your chances of success are low.\\\"\\n\\nHaving decided to do a half-year retake secretly from his parents, Choi memorizes CSAT English vocabulary whenever he has time. During hours when there are no university lectures, he goes to the school library to watch math online lectures.\\n\\n\\\"I still haven't thrown away the reference books and problem sets I used during senior year and am keeping them. I even skimmed through the March mock exam once. When my parents tried to throw them away saying they 'take up space,' I made an excuse saying 'I'm keeping them to give to a junior I know.'\\\"\\n\\nWhile he can study for CSAT 'to his heart's content' now that he's away from his parents, Choi worries about how to behave during summer vacation when he'll be with his parents. He said, \\\"During vacation, I plan to tell my parents 'I'm going to attend a TOEIC hagwon' and then take at least some college entrance exam subject classes.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3662, "output_tokens": 1288, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

We've been attacked with claims that we 'squeeze children's necks to raise scores by 1-2 points while charging excessive educational fees.' The education industry now aims to enhance students' potential rather than just their scores.\\\"\\n\\nIn 2007, a mega-sized hagwon was established with investment from a domestic private equity fund. At that time, five large hagwons in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province were integrated, bringing together 30,000 students. Since then, the business has expanded into language education, publishing, and online education services, growing into Korea's largest educational service company with 10 brands, over 800 executives and researchers, and over 4,500 instructors. This is Time Education Co., Ltd. An estimated 165,000 students study at 340 hagwons nationwide that belong to Time Education.\\n\\nI met CEO Lee Gil-ho (photo) at Time Education's headquarters in Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul. CEO Lee said, \\\"Time Education's goal is not to fill something into children's bowls, but to grow the size of the bowls that students can fill themselves.\\\"\\n\\n'Education that nurtures student potential' is connected to CEO Lee's younger days. After graduating from Seoul National University's Department of Political Science, CEO Lee started as a math hagwon instructor at Cheongsan Academy in Gangdong, Seoul (now Gangdong Hi-Est). CEO Lee said, \\\"Although I was a liberal arts student, I liked math in high school. Math was the only subject manageable enough to teach.\\\" He selected several middle school students to come to the hagwon on Sundays to prepare for math olympiad competitions. One day, the hagwon director called him. When the director asked, \\\"Are you teaching students separately?\\\" and he answered \\\"Yes,\\\" the director said, \\\"Other parents have called asking us to teach their children too. Create a regular olympiad class.\\\" That year, 5 out of 7 students taught by CEO Lee were selected as Seoul representatives to compete in the national olympiad.\\n\\nCEO Lee said, \\\"Actually, the students solved problems better than I did,\\\" adding, \\\"I was good at dividing the group—telling students with somewhat lower abilities 'You can do well enough' and 'You're doing well,' while having the high-achieving students compete with each other to do even better.\\\" When he divided them into upper, middle, and lower tiers and categorized them as 'students who enjoy competition' and 'students who need support,' the students developed on their own. When asked if he taught math 'politically,' CEO Lee laughed and said, \\\"I never thought of it that way, but looking back, I think I was good at 'organizing.'\\\"\\n\\nAfter becoming CEO of Time Education, he applied his organizational ability to let members develop autonomously to management. Initially, Time Education didn't start as a single company, and with 10 brands combined—hagwon business (Hi-Est, New Study, elc language hagwon, Elan language hagwon, MQD hagwon), publishing business (Linguaforum, Mathian, Time Books), online business (English Cruiser), and overseas business division—proper integration was difficult. Each brand emphasized different content, and hagwons insisted on their own systems. CEO Lee emphasized organizational 'chemical bonding' as the top priority.\\n\\n\\\"In military terms, if headquarters gives unilateral orders, there's resistance in the field. What I emphasized was field-centered communication. Making decisions through dialogue in the field greatly helped organizational stabilization. We also put effort into standardizing hagwon textbooks and content.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee is currently taking on new challenges worthy of the name 'Time Education' (TIME·Totally Integrated Multimedia Education). A representative example is the interactive multimedia learning system 'Symphony' introduced to some hagwons starting in February this year. Symphony is an advanced learning system where when students solve problems with electronic pens, their solution processes are transmitted in real-time to the instructor's computer through cameras and Bluetooth receivers attached to the pens.\\n\\nDuring the interview, I could watch a video of a class using the Symphony method at Hi-Est Academy in Dongjak, Seoul. About 10 elementary students solved math problems on paper with electronic pens. When the hagwon instructor clicked a student's name on his computer monitor, that student's solution process appeared in real-time on the instructor's computer screen. When the instructor displayed this student's solution process on the large monitor in the classroom, all students could see it. The instructor could immediately know how well students understood the lesson and instantly catch errors or mistakes in their solution processes.

Even then, 14 work only part-time\\nUnqualified hagwon graduates selected... Education and follow-up management also a mess\\n\\n1.14 billion won [approximately $860,000 USD]. This is the budget that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology supported last year in June to five universities that opened specialized training courses for admissions officers. However, of the 595 people who participated in this course, only 40 are currently working as admissions officers this year. The Ministry of Education plans to support 1.5 billion won [approximately $1.13 million USD] for this course again this year.\\n\\n○ Train first, think later\\n\\nLast year, the Ministry of Education opened admissions officer training courses at five universities - Kyungpook National University, Korea University, Seoul National University, Ewha Womans University, and Chonnam National University - with the goal of 'training excellent admissions officers with qualifications to respond to increasing hiring demand from universities.'\\n\\nHowever, follow-up management is a mess. There isn't even accurate data on exactly how many people actually became admissions officers. The figure of 40 is a sum of estimates from the five universities. University A said, \\\"Last year, since the project had just started, it didn't align with the September admissions officer recruitment timing,\\\" while also stating, \\\"We're only responsible for education, so employment isn't our responsibility.\\\"\\n\\nMoreover, 14 of the 40 work only part-time as commissioned admissions officers during admissions periods. University B pointed out, \\\"Major universities recruit retired principals and vice-principals with experience who can be deployed directly to the field, but regional universities have few applicants so they also recruit young people. Can such people become admissions officers?\\\"\\n\\n○ Selection criteria also a mess\\n\\nSeoul National University only operated 'teacher education courses' and 'incumbent admissions officer retraining courses.' An official from the Education Training Institute said, \\\"Given Seoul National University's prestige, we were sensitive to the idea that 'new training courses' could become employment education.\\\" Among the total participants at the five universities, high school teachers numbered 299, the largest group.\\n\\nA University B official criticized, \\\"High school teachers only need to explain application methods to students applying for admissions officer screening, but supporting them to receive over 130 hours of training is a waste of national funds. Current admissions officers also can't be helped because they have to balance it with their duties.\\\"\\n\\nThe lack of separate qualification requirements was also pointed out as a problem. The Korean Council for University Education specifies eligible participants as 'those hoping to become admissions officers, current admissions officers, those recommended by universities and schools, education specialists at various education offices, and high school guidance counselors.' However, because the qualification conditions are vague, even people who couldn't become admissions officers took the training just because they were interested.\\n\\nAlso, although the Korean Council for University Education prohibits those involved in hagwon education from applying and requires participants to sign a pledge to refund tuition if they enter hagwon education, among University C's participants was a former essay-interview team leader from a famous college entrance hagwon. He said, \\\"I'm not teaching related classes,\\\" but also stated, \\\"I usually give reading and essay lectures to high school students, and the classes were very helpful.\\\"\\n\\n○ Budget expansion\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education announced it would increase this year's budget to 1.5 billion won [approximately $1.13 million USD] to support 5-7 universities. Eleven universities applied for the evaluation that took place on the 27th of last month. However, even applying universities questioned, \\\"When last year's training course graduates haven't been hired as admissions officers, if we operate training courses again and produce more graduates, will universities be able to accept them?\\\" University C's Lifelong Education Center said, \\\"A lot of budget has already been invested, so we can only hope it settles well,\\\" while also expressing concern: \\\"We're worried about saturation since it's uncertain whether the admissions officer system will continue in the future.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding this, a Korean Council for University Education official stated, \\\"The training course isn't only for those hoping to become admissions officers. It's also for the purpose of retraining existing admissions officers who have never received education or explaining the system to high school teachers, so it's not a problem.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3254, "output_tokens": 1060, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

At loan maturity, it can be extended in one-year increments for up to 10 years depending on credit rating.\\n○ Smaller minimum amounts than counter deposits\\nInternet-only deposit products have the advantage of relatively higher interest rates than those sold at counters and can be opened with smaller amounts. Woori Bank is offering the internet-only product 'Woori e-Group Purchase Time Deposit' until the 29th with a total limit of 100 billion won [approximately $75 million USD]. The savings period is one year with no limit on deposit amounts.\\nThis product's feature is that interest rates increase as more funds are collected. A basic rate of 3.0% annually applies during the collection period, after which rates of △3.7% annually if less than 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD] is collected △3.8% annually if 10 billion won or more is collected △3.9% annually if 30 billion won [approximately $22.6 million USD] or more is collected. A Woori Bank official said, \\\"This is a product that allows small depositors, who were previously disadvantaged compared to large depositors, to receive high interest rates,\\\" adding \\\"We expect the sales limit to be reached early.\\\"\\nKookmin Bank's internet-only product 'e-Power Time Deposit' can be opened with 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] or more for up to 12 months in monthly increments. A 12-month maturity provides a basic annual rate of 3.3%, and opening a KB Star Account provides an additional preferential rate of 0.3 percentage points, allowing maximum annual interest of 3.6%.\\nKorea Development Bank has launched 'ⓤbest Internet KDB Bonds' for purchasing industrial finance bonds online. Interest is calculated quarterly on a compound basis, and bond maturities range from 6 months to 10 years. Those who sign up within June receive preferential rates of 0.4 percentage points (for 9-month and 1-year maturities). The average annual yield for 1-year KDB bonds with preferential rates is 3.92% as of May 31, which is 0.66 percentage points higher than KDB bond market rates.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3244, "output_tokens": 1012, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

While catching up, one student very proudly boasted that he had studied for 2 months at an intensive hagwon and obtained a Level 2 Chinese character certification. I felt both pleased and proud, but I was also curious about his actual Chinese character ability, so I asked him to write 'Hanshin (漢神)' in Chinese characters.\\n\\nSomething quite shocking happened. He wrote the character '漢' as '韓', and couldn't write the character '神' at all. When writing '韓', he couldn't even complete the '韋' (leather) radical at the bottom, which was even more astounding. He couldn't properly read any of the Chinese character signs on the street either. What started as a joke ended up being quite upsetting. I sharply pointed out: 'Don't go around saying you got Level 2 certification anymore. Your Chinese character ability isn't Level 2—it's Level 5.'\\n\\nIt seems that even with terrible Chinese character ability, if you focus solely on obtaining Level 2 certification for 2 months, it's possible to achieve it. But I wonder what meaning such Level 2 acquisition really holds. Considering the expensive hagwon fees [approximately $150-300 USD per month] and time invested, the results are far too disappointing. Most importantly, since they crammed and memorized Chinese characters for hundreds of hours over 2 months including classes, they probably never want to see Chinese characters again for the rest of their lives. I thought that this kind of learning, rather than being beneficial to individuals, could actually cause great harm in the long run.\\n\\nSo what kind of learning outcomes should proper Chinese character study produce? What can we say is the goal of correct Chinese character learning? First, if someone has obtained Level 2 certification, they should be able to use Korean vocabulary freely. As you well know, 50-70% of Korean vocabulary consists of Chinese character words. Chinese character learning should lead to etymologically organizing these vocabularies to improve Korean language proficiency. Therefore, simply memorizing 2,000 characters has little meaning. Of course, if even that were done properly, there would be no occasion for a teacher to scold a student.\\n\\nSecond, we should set rich literary creative activities as a learning goal. Our people have been a cultured nation that has excelled in literature and arts since ancient times. In the pre-writing period, we proved our excellence through paintings and sculptures, and through Chinese characters, we blossomed Chinese literature rivaling that of China, taking pride in our superiority.\\n\\nIn terms of continuing this tradition, if one has properly studied Chinese characters, they should be able to write diaries in Chinese characters and compose Chinese poetry. Additionally, they should be able to read classics written in Chinese characters without difficulty. Chinese character learning has meaning and value when it becomes the starting point for literary activities like this.\\n\\nBeyond the learning goals of vocabulary usage and literary creation, what's needed is learning that helps with school records [GPA] Chinese literature and CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] Chinese literature. This too can be called an important learning goal. As one learns Chinese characters, Chinese literature ability should grow, and basic skills should be developed so there's no difficulty studying Chinese literature for school records and CSAT. Finally, learning Chinese characters should inspire the desire to study higher levels.\\n\\nMaintaining intellectual interest to foster continuous learning motivation for Chinese character study is also an important learning goal.\\n\\nWe have proverbs that say 'dried persimmons are sweet for immediate eating' and 'trying to travel three days' journey in one day leads to lying sick for ten days.' For those who need certifications immediately, the temptation of intensive Chinese character courses that finish quickly may be great, but it would be desirable to properly learn Chinese characters at professional educational institutions that can realize the educational goals introduced above.\\n\\nSource: Seokbong Chinese Characters Representative Park Han-shin\\n<This material is a press release for information provision.>\\nⓒ donga.com, unauthorized reproduction and redistribution prohibited\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3378, "output_tokens": 978, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

(Right) 'Ilsan We City' in Ilsan-dong-gu, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province has seen both jeonse [key money deposit] prices and occupancy rates rise together since Goyang International High School opened early this month. A view of 'Ilsan We City' as seen from Goyang International High School. Photos provided by EG Construction, GS Construction, and Byucksan Construction\\n\\n《EG Construction's 'EG The One Phase 2' in Busan's Jeonggan New Town, which begins first-priority subscription applications on the 24th, plans to create an ultra-large educational community facility of around 1,600m² within the complex. Along with reading rooms and group study rooms, a notable space is the individual study rooms designed to conveniently accommodate teachers for workbook home tutoring or private tutoring sessions. An EG Construction official explained, \\\"This space was designed to reduce the hassle for housewives who have to clean their homes every time a teacher visits.\\\" The educational community facility also includes instrument lesson rooms where residents can play instruments freely without worrying about disturbing neighbors. EG Construction plans to expand and install such educational facilities in areas with high educational enthusiasm going forward. Construction companies' 'edu-marketing' strategies to boost apartment sales rates are diversifying. The forms vary from 'big-budget' marketing that invests hundreds of billions of won [approximately $75-750 million USD] to 'detailed' marketing that creates sophisticated educational spaces tailored to parents' expectations.》\\n\\n○ Building schools directly and creating ultra-large communities\\n\\n'Ilsan We City' in Ilsan-dong-gu, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province, a 7,033-unit complex built by GS Construction and Byucksan Construction, has seen jeonse prices rise by approximately 20 million won [approximately $15,000 USD] compared to the end of last year around the recent school opening season. During the same period, occupancy rates also rose by more than 5%. The analysis suggests that the opening of Goyang International High School, located right next to the complex, early this month served as a positive factor behind the simultaneous rise in jeonse prices and occupancy rates. The establishment of Goyang International High School gained momentum when the project developers (DSD Samho, Cheongwon Construction, Daeyang Industrial Development) signed an agreement to spend 60 billion won [approximately $45 million USD] to build the school and donate it to the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education. A GS Construction official said, \\\"Even during the initial sales period, people were skeptical since no apartment complex had undertaken such a project before, but interest surged when news spread that the school actually opened and would fill 20% of its enrollment with Goyang City students.\\\"\\n\\nAdditionally, 'Ilsan We City' plans to invest a total of 1.65 billion won [approximately $1.25 million USD] in operating expenses for native-speaking teachers and installation costs for foreign language education specialty experience rooms at schools within the complex, including Wonjung Elementary, Yangil Elementary, and Yangil Middle School.\\n\\nConstruction companies' edu-marketing initiatives gained momentum as the apartment sales market shifted from investment-focused to actual buyer-focused, targeting couples in their 30s and 40s who comprise the actual buyer demographic by making education a key marketing point for sales. However, while past education infrastructure-related marketing was limited to promoting prestigious school districts or hagwon districts around apartments, it has now evolved into an active strategy of directly attracting prestigious schools and hagwons.\\n\\n○ Attracting hagwons and subsidizing education costs\\n\\nReflecting the trend where hagwon education infrastructure influences even housing prices, there are cases of attracting famous hagwons or providing benefits for hagwon enrollment. 'Shindongbaek Lotte Castle Eco' in Jung-dong, Yongin City, Gyeonggi Province provides residents with benefits such as priority registration rights and tuition discounts for 'Samyook Language Hagwon,' an English education institution located within the complex. 'G-Well City,' being sold by Shinyoung in Bokdae-dong, Cheongju City, Chungcheongbuk-do, has created an education center within the complex, attracting famous Seoul hagwons like Jongno M School and providing benefits of approximately 75% tuition discounts regardless of the number of children.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Doosan Construction provides education subsidies of 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] and 700,000 won [approximately $525 USD] monthly for up to 27 months until move-in, respectively, exclusively for 59m² and 94m² unit contractors at 'Ilsan Weave The Zenith' in Goyang City. A Doosan Construction official explained, \\\"This is marketing tailored to the expectations of residents in their 30s and 40s who prefer apartments of this size.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies operating marketing task force teams and focusing on expanding educational infrastructure are emerging one after another. A Hanwha Construction official stated, \\\"We operate a marketing enhancement task force team separately from the marketing team to research infrastructure that helps with sales, identifying education-related needs of prospective residents,\\\" and \\\"Starting with the Daejeon Noeun District 4, scheduled for sale at the end of April this year, we are pursuing plans to attract popular hagwon chains from Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul].\\\"\\n\\nConstruction companies' 'edu-marketing' is expected to continue receiving steady love from actual buyers. Kim Gyu-jeong, general manager of Real Estate 114, predicted, \\\"When analyzing the age demographics and purchase necessity indices of actual buyers purchasing new homes, cases of seeking environments good for children's education are overwhelmingly common, so education-related marketing will continue to increase.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3906, "output_tokens": 1495, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

College prep consulting companies and online lecture companies also classified as 'hagwons'\\nThe partial revision bill of the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Hagwons and Extracurricular Tutoring passed the National Assembly's Education, Science and Technology Committee on the 11th. If this revision passes the plenary session in April, the burden of hagwon tuition fees will be greatly reduced. Going forward, one must carefully examine hagwon tuition fees, online lecture fees, and college prep consulting costs that local education offices will disclose. Dong-A Ilbo DB\\n\\n《The burden of hagwon education costs is expected to decrease starting from the second half of this year at the earliest. The 'Partial Revision Bill of the Act on the Establishment and Operation of Hagwons and Extracurricular Tutoring,' created for transparent operation of private hagwons, passed the full meeting of the National Assembly's Education, Science and Technology Committee on the 11th. It is predicted that some hagwon education cost reduction effects will appear once the revision is promulgated through the National Assembly plenary session next month. This revision bill's main points include: △requiring hagwons to include in their tuition fees certain expenses previously collected separately from tuition, such as 'essay correction fees,' 'essay instruction fees,' and 'supplementary class fees,' and report these costs to provincial and metropolitan education superintendents △mandating the issuance of receipts for all costs paid to hagwons, including textbook fees and tuition fees △including companies that provide consulting necessary for advancing to higher schools and online lecture companies that teach elementary, middle, and high school subjects in the concept of 'hagwons.' What should parents carefully check on hagwon fee receipts that their children bring home?》\\n\\n○ Roundabout tuition fees disappear... Check the receipts!\\n\\nGoing forward, receipts can be obtained unconditionally for all costs paid to hagwons. Hagwons must mandatorily issue receipts for tuition fee details and textbook purchase contents.\\n\\nOnce you receive a receipt, carefully check whether there are additional expenses beyond tuition fees. This is because various expenses that were additionally charged beyond hagwon tuition fees until now will be bundled under the name 'tuition fees, etc.' and disclosed on receipts. Being disclosed on receipts means they become subject to legal regulation.\\n\\nSome hagwons have until now demanded additional costs under the names of △essay correction fees △supplementary class fees △essay instruction fees △test application fees △textbook fees △transportation fees △specific test fees, etc., beyond tuition fees. Some hagwons even forced payment in 'cash' only, not credit cards, for these items. This loophole worked because hagwon tuition fees are subject to education office regulation.\\n\\nCurrently, the average price of monthly tuition fees that education offices nationwide have determined to be appropriate is about 90,000 won [approximately $68 USD]. This means that regardless of subject, if a hagwon conducts a total of 21 50-minute classes during a month, it should receive an average of 90,000 won [approximately $68 USD] (though it varies by education office, ranging from as little as 70,000 won [approximately $53 USD] to as much as 120,000 won [approximately $91 USD]). However, in reality, quite a few hagwons have charged various additional costs on top of this appropriate tuition fee, causing parents to sometimes pay several times more than the tuition fee.\\n\\nA Ministry of Education official said, \\\"We will include supplementary class fees, essay instruction fees, etc., that were separately charged beyond tuition fees, in the tuition fees,\\\" adding, \\\"Once the revision is promulgated, each education office will investigate hagwon fees and then set appropriate tuition fees suitable for local conditions.\\\"\\n\\nGoing forward, when purchasing textbooks at hagwons, you must request receipts. Until now, some hagwons sold textbooks that cost 5,000 won [approximately $4 USD] in the market for 15,000 won [approximately $11 USD] at the hagwon, and profited by selling textbooks copied on A4 paper at expensive prices. However, once textbook fee receipt issuance becomes mandatory, textbooks can be purchased at reasonable prices equivalent to market book prices or printing and copying costs.\\n\\n○ Online lectures and consulting companies also classified as 'hagwons'... Pay attention to provincial and metropolitan education office websites!\\n\\nStarting from the second half of this year, check the relevant provincial or metropolitan education office website before choosing a hagwon. You can verify hagwon tuition fees in advance. Starting three months after the revision's promulgation, provincial and metropolitan education office websites plan to disclose all hagwon names, locations, educational courses, subjects, capacity, class hours, and tuition fees. If the tuition fees disclosed on the website differ from the actual tuition fees the hagwon demands, you can report to the illegal hagwon education reporting center.\\n\\nIt's also noteworthy that companies providing college prep and admissions consulting and internet lecture companies are included in 'hagwons.' Going forward, all costs demanded by college prep consulting or online lecture companies will be subject to 'hagwon fee' regulation. Until now, expensive consulting costing 500,000 to 1 million won [approximately $380-760 USD] per hour has flourished in some quarters. However, from now on, these consulting companies must also report consulting costs to provincial and metropolitan education offices, so price decreases are expected.\\n\\nProvincial and metropolitan education offices plan to conduct on-site inspections of regional college prep consulting companies, then calculate appropriate costs and present guidelines. If companies report costs that are deemed too high, investigations into those companies will begin. One college prep consulting official said, \\\"The appropriate amount for consulting costs that provincial and metropolitan education offices will present is predicted to be under 200,000 won [approximately $152 USD] per session.\\\"\\n\\nOnline lecture fees are also expected to become lower. Currently, online lecture fees operated by private educational companies vary greatly depending on packages, ranging from as little as 30,000 won [approximately $23 USD] to as much as 200,000 won [approximately $152 USD]. A Ministry of Education official said, \\\"It's unreasonable to charge such high tuition fees while replaying the same lectures,\\\" adding, \\\"We plan to calculate appropriate tuition fees for online lectures using different methods from offline hagwons.\\\" Internet lecture fees will also be disclosed on websites under education office management.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4114, "output_tokens": 1543, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) linkage ratio will be maintained at 70% like last year.\\n\\nThe Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation announced these basic implementation plans for CSAT on the 30th. Seong Tae-je, the newly appointed head of the evaluation institute, stated, \\\"Starting this year, we will make maximum efforts to maintain exam difficulty consistently and increase predictability for students and parents by targeting about 1% perfect scorers in each subject area.\\\"\\n\\n○ 1% Perfect Scorers, Inquiry Subjects Are Key\\n\\nDirector Seong showed a cautious attitude regarding Social Studies and Science inquiry areas. He said, \\\"Since the maximum number of elective subjects in inquiry areas has been reduced to 3, it's difficult to predict the number of test-takers. We'll need to see the selection trends in the June mock exam first. However, we plan to make the questions easier than in previous years.\\\"\\n\\nIn last year's CSAT, which was evaluated as difficult, the perfect scorer rates were Korean Language 0.06%, Mathematics 'Ga' [advanced track] 0.02%, and Foreign Language 0.21%. Even in the 2010 CSAT, which was considered easy, the perfect scorer rates were Korean Language 0.24%, Mathematics 'Na' [standard track] 0.84%, and Foreign Language 0.74%, all falling short of 1%.\\n\\nIf the evaluation institute achieves the announced 1% level for each area, this year's CSAT will be easier than last year's. The renewed emphasis on 1% this time is interpreted as a strong commitment to make this year's CSAT easier.\\n\\nEBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) materials linked to CSAT have been significantly reduced from 45 to 24 volumes combining Korean Language, Mathematics, and Foreign Language. Director Seong said, \\\"Last year we created questions assuming test-takers would study all EBS materials, but students actually couldn't do that, and there was criticism that there were too many materials. This year should improve since we've reduced the materials.\\\"\\n\\n○ Changes in This Year's CSAT\\n\\nFirst, the Mathematics section's testing scope will change. In Mathematics 'Ga', mainly taken by science track students, elective subjects will be eliminated and questions will come from both Calculus and Statistics, and Geometry and Vectors. Mathematics 'Na', taken by humanities students, will add Calculus and Statistics Basics in addition to Mathematics I.\\n\\nDirector Seong said, \\\"There may be concerns that the Mathematics section will become more difficult due to the changed testing scope, but we will strive to maintain difficulty consistently.\\\"\\n\\nWhile there was analysis that Mathematics would become a major variable for pass/fail decisions with the addition of Calculus and Statistics Basics to Mathematics 'Na', the explanation is that studying through regular school classes and EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) will be sufficient to solve the problems without burdening test-takers.\\n\\nInquiry subject electives will be reduced from 4 to 3 subjects starting this year. Total testing time will also be shortened by 30 minutes, ending the exam at 5:35 PM.\\n\\n○ CSAT Importance Actually Increases\\n\\nEven if CSAT becomes easier, it would be wrong to assume that CSAT's importance in admissions will decrease accordingly. Major universities in Seoul are trending toward increasing CSAT weight in regular admissions.\\n\\nMost implement 'priority selection' where 50-70% of regular admission slots are filled based solely on CSAT scores. Many universities have also strengthened minimum CSAT score requirements for early admissions.\\n\\nIn an 'easy CSAT' with many tied high scorers, mistakes become even more fatal. Kim Myeong-chan, director of Jongro Academy's [a major hagwon chain] admissions strategy research institute, said, \\\"For upper-middle tier students, efforts to reduce mistakes are more important than anything. If Korean Language, Mathematics, and Foreign Language are easy, inquiry subjects could become variables, so preparation is necessary.\\\"\\n\\nLee Yeong-deok, director of Daesung Academic Development Research Institute [associated with a major hagwon], advised, \\\"Even in an easy CSAT, some questions will be made difficult to secure discrimination among top scorers. Top-tier students need to prepare for this.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3289, "output_tokens": 1187, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Despite the somewhat negative perception from others who call it an 'iron rice bowl,' civil service is considered the most stable profession. Once you pass the exam, your job security is guaranteed until retirement with various welfare benefits, making it everyone's preferred job and ranking first in preferred spouse occupations.\\n\\nTherefore, Noryangjin Gosi Village [a district in Seoul famous for civil service exam preparation], known as the mecca of civil service exam preparation, always sees a steady stream of test-takers.\\n\\nHowever, test-takers challenging nursing and public health civil service positions head to Sinseol-dong instead of Noryangjin. This is because Wiz Gosi Hagwon [a test preparation academy], which is regarded as a 'prestigious institution' for nursing and public health civil service exam preparation, is located there.\\n\\nWiz Gosi Hagwon has built its reputation through word-of-mouth by primarily focusing on nursing and public health civil service exams and recording high pass rates for many years while producing numerous successful candidates.\\n\\nWiz Gosi Hagwon specializes in lectures for the national nursing exam, nursing civil service, public health civil service, medical technology civil service, as well as nursing school transfer programs (RN-BSN) and public corporation exams. For this reason, test-takers from across the country who have related academic backgrounds and licenses—including nurses, clinical laboratory scientists, dental hygienists, physical therapists, radiologic technologists, medical record administrators, and nursing assistants—seek out Wiz Gosi Hagwon.\\n\\nThe primary reason for Wiz Gosi Hagwon's popularity is undoubtedly its high pass rate. It produces over 200 successful candidates annually in various exams including nursing and public health civil service, national nursing exams, and nursing school transfers, quickly gaining word-of-mouth recognition among test-takers preparing for related fields.\\n\\nThe reason for such high pass rates is the high-quality lectures by instructors who are well-known to test-takers nationwide. Additionally, through an integrated online-offline lecture system, busy working professionals and test-takers from rural areas can take the hagwon's lectures via video without having to travel to Sinseol-dong in Seoul.\\n\\nFurthermore, the hagwon opens level-appropriate lecture curricula including basic, fundamental, advanced, past exam analysis, and pinpoint instructor [a teacher known for accurately predicting exam questions] problem-solving classes tailored to test-takers' skill levels, helping improve their abilities.\\n\\nBeyond this, Wiz Gosi Hagwon's unique advantages include a systematic learning system through one-on-one individual counseling, along with the latest learning facilities including reading rooms, free computer rooms, study halls, and goshiwon [small residential rooms for students] referral services for test-takers from rural areas.\\n\\nMeanwhile, starting in May, Wiz Gosi Hagwon has been conducting free online mock exams where nursing students can check their skills at no cost in preparation for the national nursing exam. Reflecting the social atmosphere amid economic hardship, they are also running an event offering current students a 50% discount on tuition fees.\\n\\nYang Won-seok, director of Wiz Gosi Hagwon, advised test-takers: \\\"For effective learning, it's important to set specific goals and engage in self-directed learning that matches your level rather than just following others.\\\" He added, \\\"Since accurate information gathering is essential, beginner test-takers should obtain accurate information through consultations with experts at verified professional hagwons and establish thorough preliminary plans.\\\"\\n\\nHe also cautioned: \\\"Recently, as interest in civil service exams has increased, sites that exploit this have been sprouting up like mushrooms after rain, causing harm to test-takers.\\\"\\n\\nMany people search for hagwons through internet search sites, but recently, since websites can be easily created, some sites selling video lectures irresponsibly sell outdated video lectures that are 3-4 years old, causing harm to test-takers. Therefore, when choosing lectures, it's necessary to verify whether the company or site is trustworthy. Test-takers need to be particularly careful as they might suffer damage by signing up for lectures that don't match the exam at all.\\n\\nDetailed introductions and information about Wiz Gosi Hagwon can be obtained through their website (www.wizgosi.com). They also operate a learning consultation center 365 days a year (02-925-3447), providing various information to test-takers.\\n\\n<This material is a press release provided by the relevant institution.>\\nⓒ donga.com, unauthorized reproduction and redistribution prohibited\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3579, "output_tokens": 1171, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Implementing our 'self-directed learning philosophy' is Jaeneung Education's goal.\\\"\\nThe key keyword in education and university admissions [college entrance exams] these days is self-directed learning. This could easily be explained as 'learning on one's own.' Yang Byung-mu, CEO of JEI Jaeneung Education, emphasized 'self-learning' as Jaeneung Education's educational motto. Humans have infinite potential and voluntary nature, and given a good educational environment, they can grow into creative talent. Jaeneung Education's self-learning method was born after contemplating a scientific and systematic learning system tailored to individual abilities with the goal of nurturing creative talent.\\n\\\"This year, Jaeneung Education is pursuing continuous growth in our existing workbook business, which forms the foundation of our comprehensive educational and cultural company. We are also concentrating our capabilities on field-oriented management, textbook improvement, and learning system upgrades.\\\"\\nJaeneung Education has focused on the education business for over 30 years while keeping pace with changing educational market trends. CEO Yang set this year's management policy as 'Challenge toward the Best and First, Best 2011.'\\nThe goal is to introduce newly developed educational content such as 'Jaeneung Self-Pen,' 'Thinking Cookie Book,' and 'Jaeneung Self-Fast Math' to many consumers. Additionally, they plan to integrate last year's 'Jaeneung Self-Pen' into other learning businesses and actively pursue e-book business.\\nThey are also actively seeking synergy creation with existing workbook business. Not only will they adjust existing workbook business to digital environments like internet, mobile, and broadcasting, but they will also begin full-scale attempts to integrate various channels and content through Jaeneung Education affiliates including △Jaeneung TV △English TV △Jaeneung Academy △Jaeneung Education Training Institute △Jaeneung Self-Learning △Jaeneung Hagwon △Jaeneung University △Jaeneung Culture △Jaeneung Printing △Jaeneung Distribution △JEI Platz. The goal is to create synergy effects between industries and provide Jaeneung's educational content not only domestically but worldwide.\\nJaeneung Self-Pen is a foreign language learning tool prepared as part of developing cutting-edge educational services for the digital age. It's 2-3 times thicker than regular pens and equipped with speakers. The textbooks have invisible digital paper with audio source codes embedded. The optical recognition lens attached to the pen recognizes audio sources and plays voice files. The goal is to help members improve their reading and speaking abilities by allowing them to hear native speaker voices anytime, anywhere.\\n\\\"Jaeneung Self-Pen was developed for students and adults who have difficulty learning foreign languages.

Provided by JEI Jaeneung Education\\nJEI Jaeneung Education launched a new type of foreign language learning tool, 'Jaeneung Self-Pen,' in November last year. The Self-Pen, which is 2-3 times thicker than regular pens, is equipped with speakers so you can play and listen to native speaker voices anytime, anywhere. When you touch the pen to English, Chinese, or Japanese textbooks, the pen plays audio corresponding to the textbook's dialogues. How does this work?\\nFirst, Jaeneung Education textbooks and English, Japanese, and Chinese conversation books published by Jaeneung Education have invisible digital paper. When audio source codes are input here, the optical recognition lens attached to the Self-Pen recognizes the audio source and plays voice files. The Self-Pen is equipped with △native speaker voice support △repeat listening △speed listening practice △recording △MP3 player functions, earning it the nickname 'native speaker teacher in my hand 24 hours a day.'\\nKu Jeong-do, director of Jaeneung Education's marketing department, said, \\\"Self-Pen will help improve foreign language reading and speaking abilities,\\\" adding, \\\"As a learning tool that matches recent educational trends emphasizing self-directed learning, we expect it to receive positive responses from students and parents.\\\"\\nNurturing creative talent with self-study habits is an educational goal that Jaeneung Education has consistently pursued. Additionally, they strive to develop and distribute scientific and systematic self-learning systems with management philosophies of △human-centered △customer-centered △action-centered approaches.\\nThe 'Jaeneung Self-Learning System' is Jaeneung Education's representative learning system that realizes this goal. Jaeneung Education recently upgraded the diagnostic questions and evaluation system that accurately assess learners' learning abilities from the existing system of diagnostic evaluation→formative evaluation→summative evaluation, introducing 'Jaeneung Self-Learning System 2.0.' This is to find accurate learning starting points, because without providing appropriate level textbooks and instruction, students ultimately lose interest and confidence in studying, making proper self-directed learning difficult.\\nBased on their flagship product 'Jaeneung Self-Math,' which debuted in 1981, Jaeneung Education has developed and released textbooks for various subjects and age groups, including 'Jaeneung Self-Chinese Characters,' 'Jaeneung Self-Korean,' and 'Jaeneung Self-English.' Jaeneung Education stated, \\\"We currently have overseas branches in the United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, export 15 brands, and have over 10,000 global members studying with Jaeneung Education content.\\\"\\n▶ Inquiries: www.jei.com or 1588-1132, 1577-1578\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4239, "output_tokens": 1477, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

'Seo Nam-pyo Style Reform' Put to the Test\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"President Seo: \\\"I'll listen, but I make the decisions\\\"\\n\\nA closed-door meeting between President Seo Nam-pyo (at podium) and students regarding school policies was held at 7 PM on the 8th at the Creative Learning Building on the KAIST campus in Yuseong-gu, Daejeon [a city south of Seoul], amid recent consecutive suicide incidents. Photo provided by KAIST\\n\\nKAIST President Seo Nam-pyo's reform policies have been put to the test. With the recent consecutive student suicide incidents leading to the first-ever abolition of the differential tuition policy, attention is focused on whether other reform policies will also be negatively affected going forward. President Seo held a meeting on the 8th with approximately 400 students in attendance to narrow the gap in perspectives with students and find solutions to current issues.\\n\\n○ President-Student Dialogue Beginning with Silent Prayer\\n\\nThe meeting was originally scheduled for 7 PM that day, but was delayed by about an hour as students debated whether to accept the school's request for a media-closed session. The meeting was ultimately held behind closed doors. Kim Yang-woo, a chemistry graduate student who attended the meeting, said, \\\"We initially expected a heated atmosphere between students and the president, but it was an atmosphere where good questions received applause, and good answers also received applause.\\\" An anonymous biotechnology student also said, \\\"We initially expected a tense atmosphere, but through 4 hours and 45 minutes of discussion, it became a place to work through concerns.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, some pickets also appeared inside the meeting hall. Written in white letters on a black background, they read: 'President Seo Nam-pyo, what we need now is not your apology but the abolition of Seo Nam-pyo style reforms' and 'President Seo Nam-pyo, now is the time to stop your self-righteousness and obstinacy.'\\n\\nPresident Seo reconfirmed the abolition of the differential tuition policy during his dialogue with students that began at 8 PM at the Creative Learning Building on the KAIST campus. When one student asked whether he was willing to review various policies again, he responded, \\\"Policy review is always ongoing and continues to match the demands and situations of changing times,\\\" adding, \\\"In this process, I will listen to many other people's opinions, but decisions must be made by the president and final approval must be done by the board of directors.\\\" However, President Seo added, \\\"I will consider ways for students to participate in decisions regarding policies related to student welfare.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding student complaints about heavy academic burdens, President Seo said, \\\"When I was a freshman at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], I also felt such a heavy academic burden that there was a saying about 'putting a fire hose in your mouth and pouring water in,'\\\" adding, \\\"We are currently evaluating course loads by grade level, so we will adjust them if necessary.\\\"\\n\\n○ Reform has hit obstacles, but...\\n\\nAccording to KAIST, President Seo, who took office in July 2006, has pursued numerous reforms starting with strengthening the faculty tenure review system. In faculty personnel matters, he strengthened the tenure review system while exceptionally appointing excellent professors. In student selection, he introduced character-focused entrance exams and general high school tracks through the admissions officer system. To improve research quality, he strengthened convergence research and emphasized 'high-risk, high-return' research that is risky if it fails but guarantees large profits if successful.\\n\\nThrough this series of reforms, KAIST achieved the nation's best performance, ranking 21st globally in engineering and information technology (IT) in the world university rankings announced by the UK's 'The Times' and university evaluation agency QS in October 2009. Major donors supported President Seo's reform policies and donated approximately 130 billion won [approximately $98 million USD].\\n\\nHowever, some reform tasks have faced obstacles due to criticism that reforms were pushed through rapidly without sufficiently obtaining consent from constituents. Moreover, conflicts with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology during last year's reappointment process have put core school projects like online electric vehicles and mobile harbors at risk for budget securing. Some students are now demanding improvements to 100% English instruction following the abolition of the tuition policy. External criticism is also emerging. Professor Cho Kuk of Seoul National University Law School posted on Twitter that day: \\\"KAIST's relative evaluation system that imposes differential tuition has no 'creativity' category,\\\" adding, \\\"If students are squeezed with this evaluation system, KAIST will become the 'Killers' Advanced Institute of Stupid Technology.'\\\"\\n\\nHowever, there are considerable predictions that President Seo will not give up on reform. A Seoul National University administrative professor said, \\\"Given President Seo's track record of pursuing reforms despite various opposition, he will not easily give up.\\\"\\n\\nDaejeon = Reporter Ji Myeong-hoon mhjee@donga.com\\nReporter Lee Ki-jin doyoce@donga.com\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3746, "output_tokens": 1227, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Headaches when skill gaps emerge\\n\\nMs. Park (41, Songpa-gu, Seoul), a working mother with a middle school first-grader son in the top academic tier, recently 'broke ties' with three close parent friends. The relationship that had been strong since her child was in first grade of elementary school went awry because of 'team classes.'\\n\\nLast weekend afternoon, Ms. Park ran into her son's friend, Student A, on the street. When she asked \\\"Where are you headed?\\\", Student A looked flustered and mumbled. Sensing something strange, Ms. Park called Student A's mother. When she asked with a laugh, \\\"What are you having A do behind my back?\\\", the mother confessed, \\\"I've wanted to tell you for a while but I'm sorry. Actually, they're doing team classes excluding only your son.\\\"\\n\\nStudent A and several friends, who had been in the elementary school top tier group, had started essay writing team classes last September before entering middle school. However, they excluded only Ms. Park's son, as she couldn't provide 'rides' (taking turns driving to the team class location) due to her work. Ms. Park's son was the undisputed number one student in the entire school. Ms. Park exploded in anger, saying \\\"I can't tolerate not only that they deceived me, but that they kept it secret for over six months, even telling the children never to say anything.\\\"\\n\\nAs group classes have expanded in school settings recently and debate and presentation performance assessments have become important, 'team classes' centered on essay writing and debate are gaining popularity. Parents aim for learning synergy effects through team classes composed of relatively high-level children. Dong-A Ilbo DB\\n\\nConflicts among parents over 'team classes' are intensifying. Team classes refer to group tutoring where students of similar levels gather for subjects ranging from arts and PE to English and math.\\n\\nTeam classes have gained popularity recently, centered on essay writing, debate, and creative thinking math, as group classes have expanded in educational settings and debate and presentation performance assessments have become important. Additionally, as English and science debate competitions, English debate contests, and Model UN conferences that can build college entrance portfolios have greatly increased, team classes to prepare for these are rapidly growing, especially among top-tier students.\\n\\nTeam classes where students of similar levels gather to aim for synergy effects. However, conflicts over team classes among parents are endless. What are the reasons?\\n\\nMs. Kim (41, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul), a housewife with a top-tier second-year middle school daughter, cited 'level differences' as a factor in conflicts. Ms. Kim formed a team to compete in English debate contests for her daughter who aims to enter a foreign language high school. In debate, the role of 'speakers' is very important. The first speaker must capture the evaluators' attention and present the topic, while the second speaker must logically rebut the opposing team's first statement.\\n\\nAlthough they formed a team with top-tier students met at a debate hagwon, there were still skill differences within the group. After three months of team classes, they entered a competition but were eliminated. This was because the third speaker, who should have counter-rebutted the opposing team's second speaker's rebuttal, failed to perform their role properly.\\n\\nThe parents decided to remove that student from the team classes and soon recruited another student. Ms. Kim said, \\\"We spent a large amount on team classes, so we can't suffer losses because of a child who doesn't meet the level,\\\" and \\\"hagwons divide classes through level tests so you just follow that, but teams are arbitrarily organized by mothers, so conflicts over children's levels frequently lead to team dissolution.\\\"\\n\\nConflicts over strict team joining and withdrawal processes are also endless, as teams are formed around well-regarded instructors in the area.\\n\\nOne math olympiad prep instructor set the condition that five students must continue for a full year before starting classes. The total membership fee paid by the team is 1.5 million won [approximately $1,150 USD] per month. Five fifth-grade elementary students were assembled.\\n\\nWhen the classes had been running for about four months, housewife Ms. B (Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul) had an opportunity to send her son abroad for language study. After talking with a senior mother, she postponed the study abroad by six months. The senior mother advised, \\\"In this neighborhood, it's not like you're doing this for just a year or two and then leaving - mothers who break up teams get a reputation for having no manners and can never join team classes again. If you're going to quit, it's more comfortable to pay the remaining eight months' fees and then leave.\\\"\\n\\nMs. B said, \\\"Since one team has to match membership fees of at least 1 million won [approximately $760 USD] to millions of won [approximately $2,000–8,000 USD] per month, when one person drops out mid-way, it burdens the remaining people,\\\" and \\\"I was afraid I wouldn't survive in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] if I acted without manners.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3833, "output_tokens": 1325, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Police stated, \\\"We arrested A at his home in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province around 10 AM on the 12th,\\\" and \\\"A is denying the charges of being involved in the hacking.\\\" In police questioning, A stated, \\\"Someone I met on an internet chat site asked me to pay for mobile phone charges on their behalf, so I simply paid 6,600 won [approximately $5 USD] for server costs on their behalf.\\\"\\nPolice are investigating after securing three additional CCTV footage in addition to the two closed-circuit (CC)TV footage released the previous day. The newly secured CCTV footage captured not only the man in his early 30s whose face was revealed the previous day, but also a woman appearing to be in her late 20s. A police official explained, \\\"We confirmed that the hacker group withdrew 5.9 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] out of 100 million won [approximately $76,000 USD] deposited from Hyundai Capital using a check card in the Philippines,\\\" and \\\"We will also strengthen local investigations through international cooperation.\\\"\\nAccording to Hyundai Capital and the Financial Supervisory Service, external access attempts by forces presumed to be hackers have continued from the 8th when news of Hyundai Capital's hacking became known until today. An FSS official said, \\\"Usually when a company gets hacked, there are cases where other hackers also attempt hacking as a test,\\\" and \\\"It could be amateur hackers trying out of curiosity.\\\" Hyundai Capital announced that as of today, customer information of 420,000 people including names, resident registration numbers, and mobile phone numbers had been leaked in connection with this hacking incident, and among these, 360,000 people also had their emails exposed. Including servers for sending advertising emails whose damage scale has not yet been determined, the number of customers whose names and emails were leaked is expected to be much higher.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2613, "output_tokens": 630, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

What are the Secrets to Improving Skills?\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"-One-on-one English conversation improves reading and writing abilities together\\n-Maven Language Center's strict academic management achieves high effectiveness in short period\\n#Job seeker Lee Gang-in (27, pseudonym) has been devoted to English learning since immediately after his military discharge. He has tried everything including hagwons, study groups, and online classes to achieve high scores on TOEIC and OPIC. He eventually obtained the scores he wanted, but when he thinks about English interviews and English essays, he becomes intimidated.\\n#Office worker Park Young-min (32, pseudonym), who is preparing for a career change, recently struggled with writing an English resume. Even though he had been consistently taking online courses and practicing English conversation after getting a job, when he actually tried to write his resume, he made no progress at all. He eventually finished it with help from an acquaintance, but the future looks daunting.\\nThe importance of English in the job market is increasing day by day. While listening and reading assessments centered on TOEIC were predominant until the early to mid-2000s, speaking abilities such as TOEIC Speaking and OPIC became important from the late 2000s onward, and recently the evaluation scope has gradually expanded to include writing skills such as English essays and personal statements.\\nThe topics have also become more sophisticated. In the case of English interviews, while most questions in the past focused on self-introductions, recently there are many cases where applicants must engage in English debates based on social issues or answer job-related content in English.\\nLee Hye-jin, director of Maven Language Center (www.themavens.co.kr), which specializes in 1:1 English conversation, explains, \\\"The most frequent question interviewers ask is 'Why,' namely asking for the basis of the applicant's answers,\\\" and \\\"If you usually engage in spec-oriented English learning, it's not easy to give satisfactory answers to such questions.\\\"\\nEspecially as average English proficiency has improved, the use of advanced English that can perfectly utilize not only content but also grammar and vocabulary is important for securing a place in the acceptance range. Director Lee Hye-jin advises, \\\"Advanced English is a fundamental countermeasure for English essays,\\\" and \\\"Working professionals preparing for career changes based on their experience need higher-level English skills.\\\"\\nTherefore, rather than classes where you unilaterally listen to lectures and just follow along, it's better to take 1:1 classes that provide many opportunities to actively express your own opinions and where you can receive meticulous corrections on essays and other writing. While 1:1 English conversation has a cost burden compared to lecture-based online English conversation or phone English of about 5-10 minutes per day, it's evaluated as having high cost-effectiveness in the long term because rapid skill improvement can be expected.\\nAlso, 1:1 English conversation operates as a system where students directly set their own class schedules and make reservations, making it a suitable class format for busy university students and working professionals. Maven Language Center allows students to study with the instructor they want at the time they want, accommodating each student's individual schedule.\\nMost importantly, academic management proceeds to enable accurate and fluent English use in a short period by intensively managing all four areas: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It also has a preview and review system that uses MOLP, a specialized online learning system for speaking, allowing learners to organize topics for class discussion in advance on their own.\\nDirector Lee Hye-jin explains, \\\"Free discussion classes are conducted to help students reach the highest level of English where they can persuasively convey their opinions,\\\" and \\\"English writing such as personal statements, emails, and essays can also receive corrections to achieve smooth and concise expression.\\\"\\nIf there's a cost burden for 1:1 English conversation, small group classes of 2-4 people are also possible, allowing English learning to proceed together with friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.\\nMeanwhile, Maven Language Center is conducting an event throughout April where anyone interested in 1:1 English conversation can experience free classes at their desired time.

Photo provided by Future GT Academy\\n\\nThe importance of substantial school life is expected to grow even more in gifted education center admissions. This is because 'observation recommendation,' which was introduced last year in university-affiliated gifted education centers and gifted class selection processes, will be expanded to include education office gifted education center admissions in the 2012 academic year. Observation recommendation is a method where homeroom teachers select candidates to apply for gifted education center admissions based on their observational evaluation results of class students.\\n\\nAccordingly, interest in managing school records is growing among elementary school parents who want to send their children to gifted education centers. This is due to the perception that school grades must be good first in order to catch the homeroom teacher's attention. Efforts to achieve good results in presentation and discussion-centered performance assessments, school academic competitions, and science inquiry competitions are also active.\\n\\nIn line with this trend, specialized gifted education hagwons are also rapidly transforming. In addition to gifted education for developing creative thinking skills, they are strengthening classes related to school curriculum. 'Future GT Academy,' a specialized gifted education hagwon for elementary students operated by Hansol Gifted Education Co., Ltd., is attracting attention in this context.\\n\\nThe composition of Future GT Academy's math and science textbooks all follow the unit order of elementary school textbooks. This is to systematically learn basic concepts according to the textbook structure where content learned in previous grades is repeatedly deepened as grade levels increase.\\n\\nKang Eun-ae, director of Future GT Academy Daechi Campus [Daechi-dong is a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], said, \\\"While thinking skills math classes organized by themes like 'geometry,' 'algebra,' and 'functions' are also important, curriculum-based learning has the advantage of being able to systematically expand thinking from easy to difficult stages,\\\" adding, \\\"Here, reflecting parents' current needs, we manage everything from school records to preparation for gifted education centers and specialized high schools.\\\"\\n\\nPreparation for descriptive evaluations, which carry significant weight in school exams, is also provided. The theoretical explanation sections in the textbooks are written in a storybook-like narrative style, and unit assessments consist of 100% descriptive problems.\\n\\nHowever, it differs somewhat from typical school records preparation hagwons. Befitting its name as a specialized gifted education hagwon, experiment and experience-based, discussion-centered advanced classes are conducted to develop creative thinking skills.\\n\\nIn science classes, theoretical education and experiments are conducted in parallel every session. Individual experimental tools are provided so all students learn the process of hypothesis setting, experimental design, and experimental result interpretation. Through this, Director Kang explains, students can naturally acquire science principles and concepts related to the curriculum.\\n\\nFor example, in the 'solution concentration' unit in the 5th grade elementary course, classes are conducted where students learn the principle that 'the amount of powder that can be dissolved in a fixed amount of water is limited' through experiments making gem crystals with powder materials. Going one step beyond textbook-level experiments, they also focus on drawing out students' creativity and interest by holding competitions like 'making large and beautiful gems with solutions of various materials.' Advanced experiments at the middle school level are also conducted, such as creating rainbow-colored towers using density differences in solutions. Students must write experiment reports each time they complete a unit.\\n\\nMath classes are the same. Along with theoretical explanations, experiential and discussion learning using teaching materials and animation resources is conducted. For example, in the 'similarity ratio of figures' class, an example and illustration asking 'Can we measure the length of a very large tree by measuring my height and shadow length?' is provided through animation. Students find answers themselves while discussing how to solve this problem.\\n\\nAdvanced-level creativity problems are also covered. This is for students preparing for academic competitions and gifted education center admission. Olympiad and gifted education center past exam questions are utilized.\\n\\nDirector Kang said, \\\"The teaching method where hagwon instructors constantly ask questions and guide students to find answers themselves is also a strength of Future GT Academy,\\\" adding, \\\"Students can prepare for school discussion classes while simultaneously developing self-directed problem-solving skills and creative thinking abilities.\\\" For inquiries, visit the website (www.miraegtacademy.co.kr) or call 02-501-5350.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3569, "output_tokens": 1106, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The KAL bombing incident and the 1996 Gangneung armed infiltration incident did not appear at all.\\nLee Young-hoon, professor in the Department of Economics at Seoul National University and author of New Right history books, pointed out that \\\"current Korean history textbooks are mostly occupied by post-opening period and Joseon history, and biased narratives are also problematic, plus they lack parts related to our current lives and necessary for enhancing patriotism,\\\" adding \\\"if mandates are forced through while leaving these problems as they are, it will amplify the problems of history education.\\\"\\n○ Who Will Study If Not CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) Mandatory?\\nCriticism is also raised that if Korean history is not designated as mandatory on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), few test-takers will choose it, making it difficult to expect the effect of strengthening history education.\\nThis is because there likely won't be many test-takers who will choose and diligently study Korean history, which is more burdensome in terms of time and volume than other social studies subjects.\\nIn fact, test-takers have continuously decreased since the 2005 academic year when Korean history became a CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) elective subject. It was 27.7% of all test-takers in the 2005 academic year, but 10.5% in 2008 and 9.5% in 2011. Even in the March nationwide joint scholastic assessment for high school seniors, students who chose Korean history were 10.2% of the total.\\nKang Min-seong, Korean history hagwon instructor at Visang Edu, said, \\\"In actual CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), even fewer test-takers choose Korean history. Last year too, 16.3% took Korean history in the March high school senior scholastic assessment, but only 9.5% took it on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam).\\\"\\nCurrently, only Seoul National University and Pusan University require Korean history as a mandatory subject in college admissions. The Ministry of Education's policy is to recommend expanding Korean history requirements to the Korean Council for University Education.\\nHowever, one university official said, \\\"If just the top 10 major universities make it mandatory, the number of test-takers would increase, but it would be difficult for other universities. Making Korean history, which most test-takers find difficult, mandatory could reduce application rates.\\\"\\nFairness with other social studies subjects is also an issue. Professor Kim Ki-bong said, \\\"The current curriculum is already focused on Korean, English, and math, and 12 subjects are gathered in the small pie of social studies, so problems are bound to arise if only Korean history is made mandatory.

Hagwons struggle to find workarounds\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Dawn classes, 'ghost hagwons' operating as private tutoring…\\nRecently, as Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gwangju, and Daegu regions have restricted hagwon instruction after 10 PM, various 'mutant classes' are running rampant. Since March, provincial education offices in these regions have been operating special enforcement teams and intensively cracking down on late-night hagwon instruction with the stated purpose of reducing hagwon education costs and guaranteeing students' right to sleep. However, many hagwons are evading the enforcement net by changing their class locations and methods.\\n\\nHagwons operating 'dawn classes' have also increased, taking advantage of moments when dawn enforcement becomes lax to avoid late-night crackdowns. Ms. Choi, a third-year student at a girls' high school in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], wakes up at 5 AM even after falling asleep past midnight while studying. This is to attend a science-specialized hagwon in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]. This hagwon has been starting classes at 6 AM since March this year when late-night enforcement became severe.\\n\\nMs. Choi, who attends hagwon classes until 7:50 AM twice a week and then goes to school in her father's car, said, \\\"The hagwon opened dawn classes saying they 'had no choice to avoid late-night enforcement,'\\\" and \\\"About 10 students from each school form one class, and 2-3 dawn classes are operating.\\\"\\n\\nThere are also hagwons that continue classes in a roundabout way by moving to nearby coffee shops during late-night hours to avoid enforcement. They conduct lecture-style classes at the hagwon until 10 PM, then gather at coffee shops during late-night hours for problem-solving classes.\\n\\nAt 10 PM on the 26th of last month during high school midterm exam period, in the hagwon district of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [district], Seoul. Most hagwon doors were tightly shut and not a few hagwon signs had their lights turned off. However, nearby coffee shops and 24-hour fast food restaurants were filled with students gathered in small groups studying. In a corner of one brand coffee shop, three female high school students were solving math problems under the guidance of a man who appeared to be in his 40s.\\n\\nMs. Park, a first-year high school student, said, \\\"On days I go to math hagwon, I only attend classes at the hagwon until 10 PM, then move to the hagwon instructor's home in a nearby officetel and take classes until past midnight. Compared to before the late-night instruction crackdown, there's no significant change in the time classes end.\\\"\\n\\nSo-called 'ghost hagwons' have also appeared, centered in Seoul and Gyeonggi regions. These involve filing hagwon closure reports and then conducting classes in the form of private tutoring.\\n\\nMr. Kim, a hagwon instructor who operates a math-specialized hagwon, said, \\\"Recently, some small and medium-sized hagwon directors have filed closure reports for the hagwons and tutoring centers they operated, then run illegal tutoring rooms somewhere or conduct home-visit tutoring,\\\" adding \\\"Such tutoring rooms won't get caught in enforcement unless there's an internal tip-off.\\\"\\n\\nSome places that bear hagwon names are also operating as tutoring rooms. When we called a hagwon that distributes promotional materials marked 'Math-specialized hagwon' around Eunhaeng intersection in Junggye-dong [neighborhood], Nowon-gu [district], Seoul, a hagwon-dense area, and surrounding schools, asking \\\"I want to take classes. Where do you hold classes?\\\" the response was \\\"It's a tutoring room in an apartment, not a hagwon.\\\" When we asked again, \\\"Which apartment?\\\" they showed wariness, saying \\\"The specific tutoring location will be revealed after meeting face-to-face for an interview.\\\" The man on the phone said, \\\"We teach until 1-2 AM and provide rides home in personal vehicles,\\\" adding \\\"It's much cheaper than tutoring rooms in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] and Mok-dong [neighborhood] that charge 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] per month.\\\"\\n\\nThis illegal tutoring room was charging 450,000 won [approximately $340 USD] per month per subject for 2 hours twice a week, operating with teams of 4-5 people.\\n\\nA director of a supplementary hagwon in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Seoul, said, \\\"Due to late-night instruction restrictions and enforcement, the visible scale of hagwon education costs has decreased compared to last year, but this figure excludes illegal forms of instruction that don't show up in official statistics,\\\" adding \\\"As some students flock to illegal tutoring rooms, only hagwons that legally don't conduct classes after 10 PM are finding operations more difficult.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3395, "output_tokens": 1264, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Fresh Winds Forecast in the Transfer Hagwon Market\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"- Prime Transfer emerges as new dark horse with major influx of star instructors from K Hagwon\\n\\nThe existing transfer exam market was a system where a few companies held near-monopolies due to lack of competing businesses. According to market logic, it is an unwritten rule that markets can only develop and mature when there is competition. Nevertheless, the monopoly in the transfer hagwon market has failed to keep up with admission policies that change with each cycle, and by stubbornly maintaining outdated admission curricula and inefficient hagwon management methods under the name of tradition, it has been unable to provide high-quality educational services to students currently preparing for transfer exams.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, Prime MD, which leads the medical, dental, and pharmacy entrance exam education industry, has thrown down the gauntlet in earnest in the transfer market under the name \\\"Prime Transfer.\\\" With this, the massive monopolistic transfer exam market is forecasting major tectonic shifts as Prime, a young educational specialist company, enters the transfer market.\\n\\nPrime Transfer is researching and re-researching with the goal of creating high-quality transfer exam lectures in the transfer industry, based on the rapid entrance exam information gathering capabilities and excellent problem analysis skills that have been built up until becoming number one in the medical, dental, and pharmacy entrance exam education field.\\n\\nPrime Transfer has recruited most of K Hagwon's representative instructors to form a specialized transfer instructor team, and has created a Transfer Content Research Institute composed of 30 doctoral researchers and over 50 research staff to analyze university-specific transfer admission information in real time and work hard to develop the latest problems and content optimized for transfer exam trends.\\n\\nWith Prime Transfer equipped with solid lecture capabilities through the entry of star instructors from K Hagwon, an optimal transfer system has now been established. The differentiated transfer acceptance system Prime Mesh System (step-by-step learning support system) developed by the Prime Transfer Content Research Institute supports a Placement Test process as the foundation for selecting courses suited to individual levels, premium regular class courses that can cultivate theoretical learning through concept organization and practical sense through problem-solving, review programs that maximize understanding through organizing key weekly content and problem-solving, and even private tutoring courses that can definitively address parts not understood even after the review program.\\n\\nAdditionally, for efficient and systematic learning, they have developed and operate a special management system called the Multi Care System, with core elements including a dual homeroom teacher system that specializes by dividing counseling and learning, mandatory self-study that inspires learning motivation, customized Total Care programs through individual study plans, and C.T., a new concept learning method for overcoming practical weaknesses.\\n\\nPrime Transfer, which is investing generously in educational environment and facilities, recently expanded and relocated its Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] campus (Gangnam Station Exit 2) for the convenience of rapidly increasing students, and has also expanded and opened campuses in Noryangjin, Gwangju, and Jeonju, forecasting fresh winds in the transfer market.\\n\\nStarting in May, Prime Transfer will separately establish upper-level classes targeting TOP7 elite universities in addition to regular general classes, and will produce and provide HD-quality videos of star instructors' actual classroom lessons for test-takers who lack time.\\n\\nInquiry: Prime Transfer Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] 02) 6403-8020\\nwww.primeut.com\\n<This material is a press release provided by the relevant institution.>\\nⓒ donga.com, unauthorized reproduction and redistribution prohibited\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3145, "output_tokens": 856, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

My mind was full of things to say, but the same words just kept circling in my mouth. The online lecture stage, called the 'major leagues' of the hagwon industry. To find out how difficult it is, this reporter visited the studio of Megastudy, the industry leader. Reporter Shin Won-gun laputa@donga.com\\n\\nEloquent words pour forth in my mind. But the same words just circle in my mouth. My eyes meet the cold lens of the camera. The red light signaling 'on air' blinks. Meeting the camera's gaze doubles the pressure. My nose gets stuffy, my lips tremble. After about 3 minutes, my mouth goes dry and my throat burns. How do instructors who pour out words for over an hour endure without a single sip of water? Their skills are truly remarkable.\\n\\nAfter about 5 minutes, I enter a state of 'selflessness.' I'm curious what I'm even saying. The blackboard seems to get bigger while I feel smaller. My hands are drenched in sweat, covered messily with colorful chalk dust. After finishing the lecture and taking a deep breath, I asked: \\\"Was that about 30 minutes?\\\" Son Eun-jin, managing director of Megastudy, smiled and said: \\\"It wasn't even 8 minutes.\\\"\\n\\n○ Thousands of applicants... Only 1-2 new faces\\n\\nInternet lectures are called the 'major leagues' by hagwon instructors. As such, even debuting is difficult. The number of internet instructors belonging to industry leader Megastudy (last year's revenue approximately 245 billion won [approximately $185 million USD]) is about 230. However, new 'rookies' making their debut average only 1-2 per year. Last year alone, over 1,500 new instructors submitted applications, and even experienced instructors knocked on doors, but the 'internet wall' was too high. Among the applicants were elites including those in their 30s who graduated from prestigious university medical schools and those who earned doctoral degrees from prestigious American universities, but they too faced bitter disappointment.\\n\\nEven after the difficult debut on the internet stage, the probability of survival is extremely low. Once you fall out of favor with the brutal real-time evaluations pouring in from students, it's hard to recover. One instructor said bitterly, \\\"I taught offline for over 10 years, prepared for nearly a year, and then did internet lectures. But it took less than 10 minutes to receive notice of dismissal.\\\"\\n\\nI was curious about what exactly made it so difficult. When I asked Megastudy's Managing Director Son, she replied, \\\"Well, how about you try it yourself?\\\" So I decided to experience being an online instructor.\\n\\n○ The lecture goes awry... words and hands moving separately\\n\\nOn the afternoon of the 14th of last month at Megastudy's headquarters building in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul [an affluent district in Seoul]. In the broadcast room on the first basement floor, 26 studios were displaying their majesty. The explanation was that most (70-80%) internet lectures are filmed directly at affiliated hagwon lecture sites, with only some done here. Even so, except for the lecture room reserved for this reporter, all were in 'on air' status.\\n\\nFor this reporter, a complete 'rookie' at lecturing, we decided to cover just one problem. The time would be around 10 minutes. The subject was the politics section within the social studies area. This was a consideration for the reporter who majored in political science in college.\\n\\nThe mentor role was taken by veteran instructor Ahn Sang-jong, who has been doing online lectures at Megastudy for nearly 10 years. At our first meeting, he told me to draw a map in my head. He meant that from the start to the end of the lecture, I should break it down by seconds and calculate what to say, when to pause, and what expressions to make. When I asked \\\"Is that possible?\\\" he replied with a smile: \\\"Even instructors who are seasoned in the internet world work with lecture research teams, burning the midnight oil every day preparing lectures. Debut instructors usually take over six months just for preparation.\\\"\\n\\nAfter about 30 minutes of explanation, I still couldn't grasp it. So I immediately switched to practice mode. From instructor Ahn, I learned the lecture content and basic delivery methods; from broadcast staff, I learned gaze management, hand gestures, and blackboard writing techniques.\\n\\nSix problems were provided in the politics subject. The mission was to choose the one I was most confident about and explain it. This reporter chose a problem related to 'social contract theory' from the March national joint academic assessment. Having read related books in college and finding the concepts relatively clear, it seemed easier to explain.\\n\\nAfter tidying my appearance neatly and applying simple makeup, the lecture began immediately. Perhaps because it had been over 10 years since I tutored as a college freshman, I was overly nervous. From the first words, my speech got tangled and the lecture went awry. Feeling it was hopeless, I asked to start over.\\n\\nAfter taking a deep breath, I entered the second filming. I understood the content but was at a loss where to start explaining. So I hung my head low and just read through the entire problem first. Then came the concept explanation. The key was to accurately understand and explain the theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, the philosophers who advocated social contract theory. I understood the characteristics of Hobbes's theory, but the theories of the other two were swirling in my head. Since I was confused, my words became redundantly long. The explanation became muddled and unclear. Writing on the blackboard was also harder than expected. My words and hands moved separately. I buried my head in the blackboard and kept writing, then realized: 'The instructors I saw in videos maintained eye contact with the camera while writing on the board...' But it was already spilled milk. Suddenly looking straight ahead would seem even more awkward, so I just became friends with the blackboard.\\n\\n○ Smooth like singing, flavorful like waves\\n\\nThe lecture ended somehow. It took 7 minutes and 55 seconds. The perceived time felt five times longer. Sharp criticisms immediately followed from Managing Director Son and instructor Ahn. \\\"The lecture should flow smoothly like singing and have impact like an action movie, but yours was bland.\\\" \\\"First, you need to grab attention by hitting the key points in a deductive manner, but your introduction dragged.\\\" \\\"Building trust comes first. If the instructor lacks confidence, students will turn away in less than a minute.\\\" \\\"Your voice is too monotone. The tone and intonation should be flavorful like waves.\\\" Despite being relatively generous, the criticisms never stopped. \\\"Still, you did well for a first time,\\\" came Managing Director Son's belated consolation. My face burned with embarrassment, and I couldn't lift my head.\\n\\nA few days later, an evaluation report was delivered to the company. Megastudy's professional lecture evaluation team wrote it after watching this reporter's video. The evaluation categories were 'lecture ability, delivery, individuality, growth potential' - these four (▼ see 'Evaluation Report'). Managing Director Son said in a phone call, \\\"In actual instructor evaluations, there are over 10 categories, and each category is scored.\\\" As if seeing this reporter shaking his head, she laughed and added: \\\"If you have regrets, come tomorrow and film once more?\\\" Without a second's hesitation, I replied: \\\"That's okay. I'm satisfied with my current job.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4914, "output_tokens": 1826, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Da-hye appears as an immature character who doesn't feel the burden of college entrance exams due to her inherently bright and cheerful personality.\\nGoo Hara's transformation into a 'candy girl' unfolds in scenes where Da-hye, the president's daughter in the drama, attends classes at a repeat test-taker hagwon [a specialized hagwon for students retaking CSAT] for college entrance exams while bodyguards including Nana (Park Min-young), who is closely protecting her, remain behind her. Da-hye, who lacks enthusiasm for college entrance exams, plugs in earphones to listen to music instead of studying hard, and acts indifferent while sucking on a lollipop.\\nGoo Hara naturally embodied Da-hye during filming at a hagwon in early April, sporting cute pigtails. In particular, she excellently portrayed Da-hye's expressions and body language as she continuously showed a prickly attitude, seemingly displeased with the situation of having bodyguards attached to her even while attending hagwon lectures due to her status as the president's daughter.\\nGoo Hara is already known by the nickname 'adorable Hara-gu' on set and is monopolizing the affection of staff and senior actors. Above all, there are reports that attention was focused on her fresh and bubbly appearance with a lollipop in her mouth.\\nUnlike her immature repeat test-taker character in 'City Hunter,' Goo Hara is actually recognized as a diligent 'study idol' in real life. Goo Hara, a 2011 freshman in the Department of Media and Video Acting at Sungshin Women's University, is steadily participating in various school activities even during drama filming. On days when there's no filming or school classes, Goo Hara devotes herself to acting practice, revealing her passionate enthusiasm for her first acting challenge.\\nIn the drama, Da-hye is scheduled to launch a bumbling but aggressive romantic offensive toward 'City Hunter' Yoon-sung (Lee Min-ho). Expectations are also rising for Goo Hara's unique proposal to Lee Min-ho.\\nThe production company of 'City Hunter' stated, 'Da-hye and Goo Hara's images match well together,' and 'Since she's enthusiastic and sincere about acting, you can look forward to it.'\\nBased on the popular Japanese manga of the same name, the 2011 Korean 'City Hunter' is set in Seoul in 2011, unlike the original work which was set in 1980s Tokyo. There are temporal and spatial changes spanning about 30 years, and the characters are also reset to fit Korean characteristics.\\nIn addition to the existing story structure of the original work featuring satisfying case resolution, the content is expected to include the protagonist's growth process into the City Hunter, warm humanity revealed through sincere human relationships, and content that can provide small comfort to people who still hold hope for the future despite many wounds and pain.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2981, "output_tokens": 875, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Even before the official launch, Selpa Honor Student Classroom's differentiated self-directed learning materials and learning system have already gained popularity among education entrepreneurs.\\n\\nFrom December 21-23, the Selpa Honor Student Classroom '3rd New Teacher Training' was conducted at Jochiwon Hong-ik International Training Center for new teachers who dream of becoming great mentors in self-directed learning.

The victim couple, whose son had two front teeth broken, pretends to be 'cool' while the perpetrator couple spouts hypocritical apologies, but the hypocrisy doesn't last long. As barbed words are exchanged several times, marital conflicts and lack of communication with children are also revealed. Toward the victim's mother who emphasizes 'global citizen ethics' at every turn, the perpetrator's mother, who had been acting noble, finally kicks and pours out harsh words: \\\"How pathetic must your son be to go around getting beaten up?\\\"\\n\\nAre School Teachers the Only Ones Responsible?\\n\\nThis part draws roaring laughter from the audience, but thinking about what happens in schools these days brings tears after the laughter. Collective bullying and school violence are nothing new. \\\"One day the doorbell rang and when I went out, there were four middle school girls who looked defiant standing there. When I wondered what was going on, they asked, 'Does an elementary school student live here?' It turned out the kids had tried to pick a fight with our daughter to extort money from her, but my daughter said 'My dad is at home' and ran away. The middle schoolers had followed her all the way home. These were kids bold enough to ring the doorbell at a house where parents were present, so my daughter's future looked bleak.\\\" This is a true story told by an acquaintance. He invited the students inside, gave them snacks and pocket money, and sent them away. Then he immediately found another rental house and moved.\\n\\nLast year, there was an incident at a neighborhood middle school where a second-year student was beaten by third-year students and suffered a ruptured intestine requiring six months of treatment. Because he had lived abroad and returned, he was one grade behind his former classmates, and the reason he was assaulted was that he spoke informally to them as he used to. The perpetrator students called out the victim and took turns keeping watch while beating him in a shopping center restroom past midnight. They said they stopped beating him because their arms hurt from hitting. What enraged the victim's parents wasn't the assault itself. They were furious at the shamelessness of the perpetrator parents who said things like \\\"Kids can do that kind of thing\\\" and \\\"Isn't it enough to pay for medical expenses?\\\" One grandmother even came to the victim's house and caused a scene, saying \\\"Are you going to ruin my grandson's future?\\\"\\n\\nVarious analyses emerge regarding the causes of bullying and violence, but we cannot help but point to the side effects of competition-oriented college entrance exam education. The story goes that students stressed by academic burden and college entrance exam competition find an outlet by ostracizing classmates and assaulting juniors. However, school violence is also prevalent in Europe and America, where competitive education is less intense. Cho Byeok, Dongguk University distinguished professor who took on the role of chairman of the School Violence Eradication Advisory Committee, said in his book: \\\"While they say schools have collapsed in Korea, we still hear 'ding-dong-ding' of the school bell. In contrast, in America, we hear 'bang-bang-bang' of school guns.\\\"\\n\\nParental Selfishness of \\\"Only My Child Is Precious\\\"\\n\\nThe most important yet deliberately ignored aspect is the absence of dinner table education—that is, family education. It seems there are quite a few mothers and fathers who think that sending children to good hagwons and earning good money for them constitutes the entirety of loving their children. On top of this, parents' selfishness and double standards—like \\\"when I do it, it's romance; when others do it, it's adultery\\\"—saying \\\"when my child gets beaten, it's violence; when my child beats others, it's just kids playing around\\\"—are making the situation worse.\\n\\nAlong with schools, families are also primary responsible parties for bullying and violence. The time children spend at school is less than half of what they spend at home. And one teacher is responsible for more than 30 students. They say children grow up watching their parents' backs, but some mothers apparently shout 'Fighting!' when sending their children to school. What exactly are they telling them to fight for? The uncomfortable truth is that behind the educational field that has turned into a jungle, there are parents who push their children to 'win' rather than teaching them 'how to live together.' Of course, the responsibility of the state and society for children who cannot receive care due to family breakdown and poverty should not be diminished either.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3493, "output_tokens": 1117, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He self-studied economics by reading books like 'Mankiw's Economics.' Kim won the grand prize in a comprehensive economics and business exam hosted by an economic newspaper and even published a book titled 'Easy Economics for Youth.' Kim said, \\\"Economics was so attractive because it explains many situations in our society with a single principle,\\\" adding \\\"Doesn't the principle of 'supply and demand' apply to explaining the entire market?\\\" 》\\n\\nHigh school students, who are already overwhelmed with college entrance exam preparation, are showing vigorous curiosity about studying economics. The enthusiasm for economics learning among high school students is becoming increasingly heated as careers in economics and business fields like fund managers and analysts gain popularity.\\n\\n○ Beyond Individual Learning to Competing Skills\\n\\nHigh school students don't just stop at individual-level economics learning but compete against each other in various competitions. The number of applicants for the National High School Securities Competition hosted by the Investor Education Council jumped from 901 in the first competition in 2003 to 2,807 in the ninth competition last year. An astounding 9,600 high school students participated in the 8th KDI [Korea Development Institute] National High School Economics Festival organized by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance in January last year.\\n\\nAs a result, competitions that high school students can participate in are increasingly growing, including the High School Economics Festival and National High School Securities Competition, followed by various tests organized by economic newspapers. Economics clubs within high schools are also increasing, such as 'Veritas' at Daewon Foreign Language High School, 'Phoenicia' at Jinju High School, and 'Econ' at Gyeonggi High School.\\n\\nHigh school students' economics learning sometimes has a positive impact on school grades. Kim from Daeryun High School studied mathematics to understand economic principles and developed a habit of examining the flow of 'cause and effect relationships,' which led to his school grades rising steadily. Kim, who was admitted to Seoul National University's Liberal Studies program through early admission this year, is currently reading books on 'complexity' economics that challenge existing economics established on the assumption of 'rational human behavior' ahead of his March enrollment.\\n\\n○ Criticism of 'Spec-Building'\\n\\nThere are also criticisms that high school students' economics study boom doesn't stem purely from passion. As the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] became controversial for its lack of discrimination ability, being called the 'easy CSAT,' students chose economics-related competitions as one way of building differentiated 'specs.'\\n\\nParticularly, there's an interpretation that high school students preparing to enter business and economics programs at universities are actively challenging competitions as the admissions officer system has been expanded and introduced. In fact, specialized hagwons targeting economics and securities-related competitions are thriving in the hagwon district of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul. An official from Hagwon A, which operates economics competition classes, said, \\\"Final problem-solving courses to prepare for the KDI Economics Festival on the 14th are currently underway,\\\" adding \\\"Usually preparation starts from pre-high school students, and winter vacation courses for pre-high school students are already full.\\\" The monthly tuition for this course is 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD]. Hagwons were competitively promoting their students' competition award histories on a large scale.\\n\\nThe excessive enthusiasm is also a burden for competition organizers. Park Byeong-ju, director of the Investor Education Council that organizes the National High School Securities Competition, said, \\\"Although related hagwons have emerged, fortunately the range of winners is becoming more diverse, with winners from commercial high schools appearing,\\\" adding \\\"We are making efforts to create balanced problems by having professors and high school teachers put their heads together.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3197, "output_tokens": 987, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

After finishing the exam, she heard a story from her son that left her puzzled.\\n\\n\\\"The math problems were too difficult.\\\"\\n\\nMath problems? What was he talking about? Her son, who had been diligently studying English, was confronted with high-level numerical reasoning problems he had never seen or heard of before. When problems from a completely different field than the subject he was applying for unexpectedly appeared, he couldn't help but be flustered.\\n\\nFor the English-gifted exam, her son had studied by listening to, reading, and speaking news from American news channel CNN and British public broadcaster BBC. He had also thoroughly prepared for interviews by preparing English answers about his future aspirations and why he liked English. But who would have expected math problems to appear!\\n\\nThese days, news of successful applicants to various provincial education offices and university-affiliated gifted education centers is coming in one after another. Several parents are expressing dissatisfaction with the 'giftedness assessment' that serves as the gifted education center selection exam.\\n\\nThe gifted education center admission process is as follows: The first and second rounds proceed as 'observation-based selection' where homeroom teachers, subject teachers, and principals at each school observe the student's behavior and thought processes for three months. Students selected here go through a third-round giftedness assessment (written exam) and fourth-round interview at their desired regional education office or university-affiliated gifted education center before final selection. At this point, complaints arise that 'the selection process is unfair' because high-level problems unrelated to the application field are presented in the third-round giftedness assessment.\\n\\nWhy are high-level questions unrelated to the application field included in giftedness assessments? An elementary school math-gifted class teacher in Seoul said, \\\"Even in exams selecting math-gifted students, math problems comprise only about 20% of the total, with the rest consisting of problems measuring language or foreign language abilities,\\\" adding, \\\"It's unfortunate when students who show excellent abilities in math fail due to lack of expressive ability when confronted with language problems like 'write a creative sentence.'\\\"\\n\\nThe gifted education centers with selection authority also have valid counterarguments. They argue that if problems limited to specific subjects or types are presented year after year, some hagwon education companies turn the problems into a 'question bank.' This would allow 'manufactured' gifted students to enter through advance learning and repetitive learning, which goes against the founding purpose of gifted education centers. As competition for gifted education center admissions has intensified recently, such problems have been discovered, so from the gifted education centers' perspective, they have no choice but to create problems that measure comprehensive thinking abilities.\\n\\nBehind the great popularity of gifted education centers lies the intention of some students and parents aiming to build their 'specs' [credentials/qualifications]. This is because of the belief that having attended a gifted education center can become an important 'spec' in future specialized high school [elite academic high schools] admissions. While it's not converted into points that function as bonus points, the fact of having attended a gifted education center is recorded in the special notes section of school records. Parents say this exerts an invisible 'plus effect.' According to a teacher at a middle school-level gifted education center, every December when specialized high school admission results are all determined, quite a few students stop attending even though gifted education center classes are still in progress. This is because they have achieved their intended 'purpose.'\\n\\nGifted education refers to 'education that identifies children or adolescents with exceptional talents and helps maximize the development of their abilities and potential.' Can true gifted education really be achieved in such an environment?\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3260, "output_tokens": 926, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Application rates among teenagers and early twenties surge\\n- Students about to graduate high school catch two birds with one stone: advancement and employment\\n- Additional recruitment begins January 17th!\\n\\nKorea Cyber University (www.cyberkorea.ac.kr / President Kim Jung-soon / 106 Bukchon-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul) successfully completed its 2012 regular admissions recruitment for new and transfer students on the 4th. Korea Cyber University, which continues Korea University's reputation in cyberspace, had been recruiting new and transfer students since December 1st. Along with the Business Administration department, which traditionally had high application rates, the Applied Foreign Languages, Counseling Psychology, and Social Welfare departments enjoyed great popularity, while the Tax/Accounting, Computer Information and Communication, and Child Care departments also showed growth.\\n\\n▽ Application age decreases... Application rates among teenagers and early twenties surge\\n\\nKorea Cyber University has welcomed applicants from all age groups from teenagers to those in their 70s for various purposes including bachelor's degree acquisition, career development, and lifelong education. However, recently the application age has been noticeably decreasing. The average age of all applicants in 2012 was 31.5 years, 0.7 years lower than the previous year, and new and transfer applicants from teenagers to early twenties comprised 26.5%, which was 5% higher than the previous year's 21.6%. This phenomenon was more pronounced in the new student admissions, recording 36.1%, which was 8.2% higher than the previous year's 27.9%. While those from their mid-to-late twenties through their 30s-40s still comprise a large portion, other age brackets have slightly decreased while the proportion of teenagers and early twenties has significantly increased, which is analyzed as encouraging. New and transfer applicants in their early twenties increased by 4% compared to the previous year, and applicants in their twenties comprised 47%, which was 3.3% higher than the previous year.\\n\\n▽ Pursuing 'practical benefits' over 'hollow prestige' of universities in name only\\n\\nKorea Cyber University positively evaluates this trend of increasing applicants in their teens and twenties. This is because cyber universities, which began in 2001 to promote lifelong education, are establishing themselves as a definitive 'alternative' to higher education institutions, surpassing the recently exposed substandard offline universities. Advancing to cyber universities, where one can receive excellent higher education at low tuition costs and simultaneously secure both career and degree, is also related to the changing mindset of the young generation that pursues 'practical benefits' over the 'hollow prestige' of educational institutions that are universities in name only.\\n\\nKorea Cyber University, to attract excellent talent, has been providing scholarship benefits starting from this admissions cycle: full tuition for two years to new students recommended by high school principals, and 50% of admission fees to new students who graduated from specialized high schools (vocational high schools) within the past three years.\\n\\n▽ Students who caught two birds with one stone: advancement and employment\\n\\nLee Min-hyeok (18), who received admission notification on the 11th and became a first-year student in Korea Cyber University's Computer Information and Communication department, said, \\\"Becoming interested in cyber universities in my senior year of high school was great fortune for me,\\\" and \\\"Since all three siblings are high school students, the burden on our parents was great, but I decided to enroll because tuition is affordable and I can study while working.\\\" Lee also expressed his firm aspirations, saying, \\\"I will save as much time as possible to diligently study for certifications and foreign languages,\\\" and \\\"I will work hard to be recognized as a computer expert.\\\"\\n\\nJeon Eun-soo (18), who was accepted to the Lifelong Education department while facing high school graduation in February, also shared her admission feelings, saying, \\\"I chose the Lifelong Education department because I have been interested in learning and teaching since I was young,\\\" and \\\"As a high school senior, I'm happy that I can simultaneously solve advancement and employment, making me feel like a proud and honorable daughter to my parents.\\\"\\n\\nThere are also many cases of students advancing to cyber universities to purely focus on academics. Kim Tae-ri (18), who said, \\\"Growing up in Sweden in my childhood, I was deeply impressed by the child welfare and medical welfare systems of that welfare-advanced country and applied to the Social Welfare department,\\\" revealed her determination, saying, \\\"I will systematically study all aspects of social welfare through Korea Cyber University's Social Welfare department's diverse curriculum and in-depth lectures,\\\" and \\\"I plan to re-take lectures for parts I find lacking in the course and organize them until I understand.\\\" Kim also dreams of advancing to graduate school after graduation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Korea Cyber University will conduct additional recruitment for new and transfer students from January 17th to February 15th. Detailed information and application methods can be confirmed at the Admissions Support Center (http://go.cyberkorea.ac.kr), and 1:1 customized consultation (02-6361-2000) is also provided.\\n\\n<This material is a press release provided by the relevant institution.>\\nⓒ donga.com, unauthorized reproduction and redistribution prohibited\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3687, "output_tokens": 1295, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The phenomenon of avoiding science tracks is becoming increasingly severe. Educational authorities and frontline schools also bear responsibility for failing to provide appropriate educational environments for students aspiring to pursue science and engineering fields. Despite this situation, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology recently announced a policy to reduce science elective subjects, claiming it would reduce students' burden. There are concerns that the status of science education in schools will further diminish.\\n\\nThe situation is the same for science and engineering students being marginalized in college entrance exam hagwons. Currently, it is difficult to find most college entrance exam hagwons that operate separate educational systems for liberal arts students and science students. There are many cases where science students, who are relatively fewer in number, receive classes adapted to liberal arts students' curriculum. However, since liberal arts and science tracks have completely different learning directions and methods, learning curriculum and class formation exclusively for science students is essential even in college entrance exam hagwons.\\n\\nFirst, it is necessary for hagwons to organize natural sciences essay-writing exam [a component of some university admissions] classes as regular subjects and prepare intensively so that science students can prepare for both the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) and natural sciences essay-writing exams together. In the 2013 academic year admissions, the early admission ratio exceeds 60%.\\n\\nThere is also a need to differentiate class hours and teaching methods considering science students' fields of interest and grades. Preparatory schools for medical, dental, and Korean medicine programs, preparatory schools for prestigious universities like Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University, and preparatory schools for engineering-strong universities like Hanyang University should be operated separately to provide customized classes for students.\\n\\nThe core of science subjects is the mathematics section. The mathematics section is both the standard for gauging the overall difficulty of the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) and the key factor that determines success or failure in actual admissions. Even if somewhat lacking in other areas, obtaining high scores in the mathematics section broadens the range of university and department choices in admissions. Students weak in the mathematics section also need to aim for high scores using step-by-step learning such as basic stage, intensive reinforcement stage, and weak area supplementation stage.\\n\\nMin Seokhwan\\nCEO of Pentas Boarding Hagwon\\n\\nFor the science inquiry section, it is important to select subjects that match one's preferences and level and design appropriate learning methods. Also, attention must be paid to the fact that the scope of questions for the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) and early admission screening are different. Students who have neglected Science Elective Subject II in their daily studies need to intensively supplement this. While Science Elective Subject I is sufficient for the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), much background knowledge corresponding to Science Elective Subject II must be acquired for early admissions.\\n\\nScience-specialized hagwons provide professional educational systems to science students with these points in mind. It is our hope that students aspiring to science and engineering fields will grow into excellent future scientific talents in customized educational environments. Furthermore, we expect science students to participate in developing Korea's science and engineering fields with pride and a sense of mission.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2869, "output_tokens": 821, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Jobs increased by a whopping 68.6%, from 99,326 (1999) to 167,461 (2009). Geumcheon District (64.1%), Songpa District (45.5%), Seocho District (41.6%), and Mapo District (41.1%) followed. Two districts actually saw job losses. Yongsan District's job count decreased by 8.04% from 117,148 (1999) to 107,732 (2009). Dongdaemun District decreased by 5.63%.\\nOur paper analyzed job trends by Seoul's 25 autonomous districts and location quotients showing the concentration of specific jobs together with Professor Jeon Byung-yu of Hanshin University (Deputy Director of the Peace and Public Commons Center). For example, if an autonomous district has a location quotient of 1 or higher for Industry A, it means the proportion of Industry B jobs is higher than Seoul's average. This allows us to understand what specialized jobs exist compared to other districts.\\n○ The Power of Guro Digital Complex, Ventures\\nGuro District's steep job growth was due to the successful transformation of the declining Guro Industrial Complex into Guro Digital Complex. About 14,000 small and medium IT companies, venture companies, and publishing/media firms are housed in apartment-style factories lined up in rows. Indeed, the most specialized industry in Guro District is publishing/media/communications/information services. This sector has 2.38 times more jobs than Seoul's average.\\nNeighboring Geumcheon District ranked second in job growth rate. Its specialized jobs are in manufacturing, 3.58 times more than Seoul's average. About 6,500-7,000 companies are located in the former Guro Industrial Complexes 2 and 3, with roughly half being manufacturing companies.\\nMeanwhile, Yongsan District, which saw job losses, has many jobs in wholesale/retail (1.46) and food service/accommodation (1.37). Wholesale/retail developed due to the location of Itaewon Special Tourist Zone and Yongsan Electronics Market. While Yongsan District is the only place specialized in wholesale/retail jobs, the employment effect was analyzed to be modest.\\nProfessor Jeon said, \\\"Districts like Guro, Geumcheon, and Mapo, where Seoul created many jobs, are places where publishing/media/communications/information industries and manufacturing have developed,\\\" adding, \\\"This shows that industries linked with manufacturing such as IT can become 'Seoul-type jobs.'\\\"\\n○ If Gangnam District is IT, What Industry is Gangseo District?\\nOn average, each autonomous district had 6.68 industries with location quotients of 1 or higher. These industries serve as growth engines supporting the local economy. Gangnam District and Seocho District showed professional scientific technology job location quotients of 1.86 and 2.05 respectively, nearly twice Seoul's average. This is because Gangnam District [an affluent district in Seoul] has a concentration of IT companies, while Seocho District has many public and private research institutes.\\nThe district with the highest education location quotient was Nowon District (2.62), followed by Seongbuk District (2.52) and Gwanak District (2.06). Nowon District has the most schools among Seoul's autonomous districts, with 95 elementary, middle, and high schools. The Junggye-dong Bank intersection has so many hagwons [private academies] concentrated there, with major Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] hagwons moving in one after another, that it's called the 'Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] of Gangbuk [northern Seoul],' leading to many hagwon education workers as well. Gwanak District has Seoul National University, the largest university in Korea, while Seongbuk District has Korea University, Hansung University, Dongduk Women's University, and Sungshin Women's University clustered together. Among education jobs, university employment is by far the largest.\\nTransportation jobs were most concentrated in Gangseo District (3.61), Dobong District (2.84), Jungnang District (2.41), and Yangcheon District (2.12) in that order. Gangseo District has logistics centers related to aviation and shipping concentrated there due to nearby Incheon International Airport and Gimpo Airport. Additionally, the Agricultural and Marine Products Distribution Wholesale Center and Southern Freight Terminal are located there, leading to developed freight transportation. Dobong District has many taxi companies - 25 companies with 2,217 vehicles and 3,047 individual taxis concentrated there. Due to cheap rent, there are also many bus garages, according to the analysis.\\n'Korea's Wall Street' Yeongdeungpo District and Jung District had many financial insurance jobs. Yeongdeungpo District houses the Financial Services Commission, Financial Supervisory Service, and Korea Exchange. As of the end of last year, 139 out of 286 Korea Financial Investment Association member companies were concentrated in Yeouido-dong.\\nGangdong District and Seodaemun District specialize in health and welfare jobs, while Gangbuk District and Eunpyeong District specialize in public administration jobs.\\nReporter Woo Kyung-im    woohaha@donga.com\\nIntern Reporter Hwang Ji-hyun, 4th year Public Administration, Kyung Hee University\\n:: Location Quotient ::\\nThe proportion of workers in Industry A in an autonomous district divided by the proportion of workers in Industry A in all of Seoul. A location quotient greater than 1 means there are more jobs in Industry A than Seoul's average. This analysis of location quotients by Seoul's autonomous districts utilized the 1999 and 2009 'Basic Statistics on Establishments' which surveyed the number of establishments and workers nationwide.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3643, "output_tokens": 1486, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Among the approximately 40,000 admission slots at 15 major universities in Seoul for the 2011 academic year, about 18,000 went to repeat test-takers [students retaking CSAT after high school graduation]. Simply calculated, about 12% of the total 150,000 repeat test-takers nationwide gained admission to major universities.\\n\\nHowever, experts say, \\\"It would be problematic to interpret optimistically the statistics showing many repeat test-takers at top universities.\\\" This is because most repeat test-takers who gained admission to major universities were either half-repeat students [students who had already been accepted to prestigious universities] or originally high-achieving students who chose to retake due to poor strategic planning. In particular, it's difficult to succeed without overcoming the fatal weaknesses of repeat test-taker life.\\n\\n○ Overcome the disadvantage of time management\\n\\nRepeat test-takers have more time flexibility to prepare for the CSAT compared to high school seniors. This is why the general analysis suggests repeat test-takers have an advantage in regular admissions or early admissions with high CSAT weighting.\\n\\nHowever, repeat test-takers are at a disadvantage in time management compared to high school seniors. Schools have class schedules and students take midterm and final exams according to predetermined subjects and scope, so they don't need to create separate study plans. Repeat test-takers must organize all their study plans themselves.\\n\\nRepeat test-taker Kim Dong-young (19) had received first-grade marks in math and science during his high school senior year and set an entrance strategy to aim for early priority selection at Yonsei University and Korea University. However, after receiving below-expected scores on the CSAT and failing admission, he decided to retake. He said, \\\"Overestimating myself too much was the cause of failure,\\\" and as a result of dedicating himself to studying, he gained admission to his target program, Materials Science and Engineering at Yonsei University.\\n\\nKim calculated his available self-study time on a weekly basis and distributed it by subject. He typically allocated 5 hours on weekdays and 10 hours on weekends for self-study, dividing the total 45 hours by subject area according to his problem-solving speed.\\n\\nHe often divided the time as follows: 15 hours for Korean language, and 10 hours each for mathematics, foreign language, and inquiry subjects. For Korean language, his weak subject, he set aside 3 hours specifically for organizing wrong-answer notes, and on weekends he also scheduled time for taking practice tests. When he occasionally felt exhausted, he would meet and hang out with friends. Time lost to playing was always made up the following week.\\n\\nKim said, \\\"Since I know my problem-solving speed best, it's important to adjust study volume according to that speed.\\\"\\n\\n○ Restrain yourself\\n\\nAnother weakness of repeat test-takers is weak binding force. In school, students receive guidance from teachers and take exams at regular intervals. Even if repeat test-takers attend hagwons [private academies], they can skip classes or quit at will. Without strong willpower, it's difficult to consistently maintain test-preparation life.\\n\\nRepeat test-taker Choi Kyung-seok (20) used methods to restrain himself to avoid becoming lazy. When he first attended a hagwon, he often wasted time sitting in front of the computer after coming home. Thinking this wouldn't work, he left home and lived in a goshiwon [small residential room] near the hagwon. He repeated a lifestyle of studying until 11 PM, then sleeping in the goshiwon and studying at the hagwon from 6:30 AM.\\n\\nHe said, \\\"During my high school senior year, I was lucky to get good practice test scores once. I think becoming lazy from that point was the cause of failure,\\\" adding \\\"I was most wary of becoming mentally lax.\\\"\\n\\nHe studied basic concept books from the beginning and read 5 Korean language passages every morning. During morning hours when he studied best, he intensively studied Korean language and foreign language, his weak subjects. Choi said, \\\"During my high school senior year, I focused on solving all problems, but during my repeat year, I focused on figuring out knowledge related to the problems—that was the biggest difference.\\\"\\n\\nIn the 2011 CSAT, Choi's Korean language and mathematics were only 4th grade, but in 2012 his Korean language, mathematics, and foreign language all became 1st grade. He is waiting for Seoul National University admission results while having already been accepted to Korea University.\\n\\n○ Maintain study rhythm until the end\\n\\nIf repeat test-takers lose concentration during their repeat year, their grades tend not to rise but fall as the CSAT approaches. According to entrance exam specialists, repeat test-takers show marked grade improvement after the March mock evaluation. However, the upward trend slows from after the September mock evaluation and actually declines. In contrast, most high school seniors maintain consistent study rhythm from March until the CSAT, so sudden grade drops at the last minute are rare.\\n\\nChoi said, \\\"After September, I felt I had completed my targeted studying and had nothing left to do.\\\"\\n\\nTo maintain consistent study rhythm, from September onward he continuously solved final problem sets while timing himself and re-solved past exam questions. He also set a goal of reviewing EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] materials five times per book and continued studying until the end.\\n\\nRepeat test-takers also have the weakness of experiencing difficulties in relationships with people around them. Having already experienced failure, they easily develop an inferiority complex. They may create conflicts with colleagues or family members sharing the repeat test-taker life, or fall into relationships or drinking.\\n\\nMany test-takers feel great psychological burden about failure and cannot concentrate on studying, or face physical limitations. Particularly if grades drop in summer when June mock evaluation results come out, it can lead to a slump.\\n\\nSon Eun-jin, executive director at Megastudy, advised, \\\"Repeat test-taker life doesn't unconditionally lead to success. To succeed, the purpose for retaking must be clear, and willpower to cut off bad habits is necessary.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4149, "output_tokens": 1549, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The purpose was to identify factors behind NEAT score differences.\\n\\nThe hagwon education industry has argued that \\\"NEAT's speaking and writing components are difficult to prepare for without hagwons.\\\" However, the survey results were different. Students who did not attend hagwons had an average combined score of 178 points across NEAT's four areas, while students with 0-2 hours of daily hagwon instruction scored 186.5 points, those with 2-4 hours scored 182.2 points, and those with 4-6 hours scored only 163.6 points. More hagwon study did not lead to higher scores.\\n\\nConversely, self-directed learning time was directly correlated with scores. Students who reported no self-study time scored only 129 points, but those with 0-2 hours daily scored 185.2 points, 2-4 hours scored 200.8 points, and 4-6 hours scored 229.7 points, showing increasingly larger gains.\\n\\nTeachers' self-development efforts also affected students' scores.

However, the classes are no different from existing TOEFL and TOEIC courses. The textbooks also use both commercially available TOEFL materials and NEAT materials together. A major franchise language hagwon also opened a hagwon with the NEAT name, but the classes are identical to TOEIC preparation courses.\\n\\nThe government responded that the hagwons' promotions are absurd. A Ministry of Education, Science and Technology official said, \\\"We're currently determining NEAT's exam format direction, so companies already making textbooks and conducting classes is merely creating anxiety.\\\"\\n\\nTo counter hagwons' indiscriminate courses, the government will begin NEAT special lectures through EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) starting at the end of this month. KICE will also directly produce NEAT textbooks and plans to create a website for NEAT speaking and listening practice by September, making it freely available to everyone.\\n\\nNam Yoon-seo, Reporter        baron@donga.com\\nKim Nam-yoon, Intern Reporter, Sogang University Department of Mass Communication, 4th year\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2930, "output_tokens": 936, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Reporter Kim Ji-hyeon jhk85@donga.com\\n\\nOn the afternoon of the 2nd, a Japanese woman with a deeply troubled expression entered Jongno Police Station in Seoul together with staff from the Japanese Embassy. It was Nakamura Kuni (69), who has been wandering around searching for her daughter Nakamura Minako (中村三奈子, 33) for 15 years since she disappeared in Korea in April 1998.\\n\\nMinako, who was 19 years old at the time of her disappearance, suddenly vanished while preparing to register for a university entrance exam prep hagwon [Korean private academy for college preparation], leaving only records of departing from Niigata Airport in Japan and entering Korea through Gimpo Airport. Japanese police who launched an investigation confirmed only that there was a Korean Air ticket to Seoul reserved under Nakamura's name and that he had actually entered Seoul on that flight, but could find no other traces. Korean police, who began searching for Minako in December 1999 at Kuni's request for investigation, also closed the case as unsolved in 2005 without significant results.\\n\\nIn the year when Minako's disappearance first became known, Japanese society also showed keen interest. A 'Society to Find Nakamura Minako' composed of ordinary citizens was formed, and TV programs even attempted to find Minako using psychics. Some media cautiously raised the possibility of Nakamura's abduction to North Korea. However, even this interest has disappeared with time.\\n\\nEven though others have all forgotten, a mother could not give up on her daughter. Minako was the youngest daughter that Kuni had raised alone with determination after losing her husband early. Kuni, who was an elementary school teacher, even quit her job to search for her daughter. \\\"I still don't understand why my daughter, who was focused on studying saying she absolutely had to go to university, suddenly left for Korea,\\\" she said, asking Korean police for a reinvestigation before returning that day.\\n\\nKuni, for whom this was her 12th visit to Korea, met with a reporter at a Seoul hotel on the 3rd and said, \\\"Rather than being absent-minded, it's more comforting to be in Korea where my daughter disappeared.\\\" She also said that when she gets off at a Korean airport and breathes in the air, her heart feels at ease thinking that somehow she's breathing the same air as her daughter.\\n\\nShe still cannot forget her last conversation with her daughter. Her daughter, who was particularly affectionate, had helped make decorative teaching materials that Kuni, who was a teacher, would take to school even until the night before her disappearance. \\\"There were absolutely no traces of her packing clothes or money separately. I still can't even guess the reason why my daughter disappeared,\\\" she said.\\n\\nWhile in Korea, Kuni posted 1,000 flyers searching for her daughter throughout Seoul. The flyers, which she personally made in Korean and Japanese, contain her daughter's last appearance along with the heartbreaking message: 'Where are you and what are you doing? Let me know that you're healthy. I'm waiting for you.'\\n\\nMinako Nakamura at age 19 when she went missing\\n\\nDuring her stay in Korea, although cold waves hit and heavy snow fell, Kuni completed her entire schedule on foot. This was because of her last hope that she might accidentally encounter her daughter while walking down the street. She says she still lives in the same house where she lived with her daughter because she doesn't know when her daughter might return, and she tries to visit Korea once a year. Thinking that she needed to speak Korean to find her daughter, in 2008 she even studied Korean for a month at Korea University's language institute. As if that alone wasn't enough devotion, on April 7th, the day her daughter disappeared, she spends the entire day at the airport handing out flyers to tourists departing for Korea.\\n\\n\\\"Whenever I see young Korean women, they all seem like my lost daughter and I tear up,\\\" she said. With just a few hours before her departure, she made a final request: \\\"I really want to know even just news of where and how she's living. I hope Korean people will not forget our daughter and continue to show interest.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3540, "output_tokens": 1115, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is the tutoring fee charged by a boarding camp claiming to prepare students for the American college entrance exam (SAT). This is the highest tuition fee detected by education authorities to date.\\nThis amounts to 300,000 won [approximately $225 USD] per day, yet 113 students participated in the camp. Most had been attending high school abroad and temporarily returned to Korea to prepare for the SAT.\\nThese students entered dormitories set up by A language hagwon in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] at B English Village in Gyeonggi Province from mid-June. The schedule included taking tests early in the morning on weekdays, then attending reading, writing, and math classes from 9 AM to 9 PM, followed by self-study until after midnight. Weekends featured essay and extracurricular lectures. A language hagwon also held an SAT boarding camp last year for 15.4 million won [approximately $11,500 USD] over 8 weeks. Even then, applicants overflowed. Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education recently reported A language hagwon to police.\\nLanguage hagwons in the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area have increased SAT classes during summer vacation since the mid-2000s. The number of students has grown significantly each year. Unlike the United States where hagwons are virtually non-existent, these hagwons analyze past exam questions and provide pinpoint instruction [teaching known for accurately predicting exam questions], raising scores by hundreds of points in just two to three months.\\nMost students are those who went abroad for early study abroad or left for immigration with their parents. Since they come from economically well-off backgrounds, the more expensive the tuition, the more applicants flocked to these programs.\\nParent Ms. Jung (52, female) brought her son studying in America back to Korea for SAT hagwon education [in Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry] during summer vacations last year and this year, saying: \\\"There are quite a few kids who received perfect SAT scores after boarding in Korea. The established belief is that if you want to get into the Ivy League, you can't just play around in America during vacation. You have to make maximum use of your time in Korea, so even if it's expensive, the tough places are popular.\\\"\\nBesides the A language hagwon caught this time, there are many places in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] that offer SAT intensive courses for around 5 million won [approximately $3,750 USD] for 4 weeks. Some language hagwons test applicants, claiming they will only accept high-level students. However, no students are rejected. They accept all students by dividing courses by level.\\nRecently, methods have emerged to increase tuition fees by placing Ivy League students as consultants or mentors.\\nLocal governments, unable to escape deficits from English villages built like mushrooms after rain, are helping illegal instruction by expensive SAT hagwons by renting facilities to expensive camps.\\nPunishment remains minimal. Last summer, C hagwon in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] was caught charging 6.9 million won [approximately $5,200 USD] for 4 weeks but only received a suspended prosecution. Administrative penalties for hagwon crackdowns are divided into warnings, suspension of instruction, registration cancellation, and criminal charges, but all are at the level of slaps on the wrist.

Although the 700,000 won [approximately $525 USD] consultation fee was burdensome, she visited their office in Seocho-gu, Seoul with a desperate heart. In the small office, there was one male and one female employee. The male consultant recommended about 10 universities to Ms. A. When Ms. A asked about special consideration tracks for socially disadvantaged groups, the consultant only recommended irrelevant tracks focused on essay-writing exams and aptitude tests.\\n\\nThe consultant said, \\\"You need to prepare six things: essay-writing exam editing, personal statement editing, portfolio, etc. For Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University, it's 800,000 won [approximately $600 USD] per item, but for universities below that level, we'll do it for 600,000 won [approximately $450 USD],\\\" speaking as if doing her a favor.\\n\\nSuddenly, memories of shedding tears of blood during her son's college admissions four years ago came flooding back. Early admissions had expanded so much that she couldn't understand what was what, and even the homeroom teacher told her to write the teacher recommendation letter at home. Her son ended up attending a university below his academic level.\\n\\n'She's my only daughter... This is a once-in-a-lifetime college entrance exam...' She emptied her bank account and borrowed 3 million won [approximately $2,250 USD] from people around her, paying a total of 4.3 million won [approximately $3,200 USD].\\n\\nThe results were absurd. The personal statement her daughter had written and submitted came back with only the comment 'well written' and a couple of lines of editing. Even the spelling was wrong. When the homeroom teacher saw this statement, she drew red lines all over it.\\n\\nWhat came as essay-writing materials were past exam questions publicly available on university websites, newspaper articles, and the address of a free essay website based on standards from 10 years ago.\\n\\nProtesting was useless. In the end, Ms. A submitted applications to the four places she had originally hoped for. When she demanded a refund, the company stopped taking her calls. Ms. A wiped away tears, saying, \\\"For people like us, this is a monthly rent deposit.\\\"\\n\\nDirector K of this company only said, \\\"We provided all the necessary information.\\\" He did not reveal what information was provided. When asked whether they had registered with education authorities, he first claimed they had registered with Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Education Office, but then changed his words saying \\\"I'll look into it and contact you\\\" before hanging up.\\n\\nHigh-priced college admissions consulting scams that prey on parents by exploiting the fact that admission guidelines are so complex that even frontline school teachers struggle with admissions guidance never cease. Student B, who was preparing for overseas Korean admission tracks, also recently lost 1 million won [approximately $750 USD]. The director of a company he contacted after seeing an advertisement on an internet cafe claimed, \\\"I've been managing early study abroad students for over 20 years and have sent them to Yonsei University and Korea University.\\\" When his mother was persuaded to pay 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] and they visited, the director recommended four admission tracks and said they needed to pay 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] per track for additional consulting. That was all.\\n\\nThe characteristic of such companies is that most lack experience or expertise related to college admissions and are not even registered as hagwons. They frequently change their business names and demand consultation fees in cash. Although anyone can see they are clearly fraudulent, those whose judgment is clouded by desperation before college admissions easily fall victim. College admissions experts advised avoiding unknown private companies and seeking safe services. Through the Korea University Education Council's counseling center (univ.kcue.or.kr) or phone (1600-1615), you can receive free consultations from current school teachers in charge of college guidance.

Born in the United States to parents from India and Bangladesh, he was a financier who studied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and graduated from Harvard Business School (MBA).\\n\\nWhat sparked his interest in education was when he began providing math tutoring to his younger cousins. When it became difficult to coordinate schedules for individual video chat tutoring sessions with his distant cousins, he simply uploaded lecture videos to YouTube. Soon emails poured in not only from the United States but also from Europe and the Middle East. A woman who was forbidden from studying for religious reasons began learning for the first time in her life through his videos. A Black student who couldn't adapt to school life due to racial discrimination also became an honor student and entered university.\\n\\nThe author established the non-profit educational foundation 'Khan Academy' in 2008 to provide full-scale services. The lectures here are condensed to only essential content, so each video is around 15 minutes long. Rather than the 40-60 minute packed, rote-learning education that takes place in regular schools, short lectures are followed by leaving the 'real studying' to the student's discretion.\\n\\nThis book adds interest by introducing experimental cases of implementing Khan's liberal education model in pilot schools in California. The results showed that students with slower learning speeds improved their grades after receiving Khan Academy-style education.\\n\\nWhether children study well or poorly, there's no one in our reality who doesn't have concerns related to their child's studies. The book's cases offer significant implications for our education system, which is structured around college entrance exams without tests or grade distinctions. In particular, the author, who harshly criticizes the top-down educational model that flows from teachers to students, ultimately presents the concept of a 'One World Schoolhouse' after conducting field experiments.

Furthermore, neither universities nor middle and high schools will be allowed to reflect external organizations' academic competitions or certifications in their admission processes.\\nThese are the main contents of the 'Special Act on Promoting the Normalization of Public Education' proposed by Saenuri Party Representative Kang Eun-hee on the 30th. This bill emerged after prior coordination with the Ministry of Education, which intends to pursue it as a member-initiated legislation. This represents the blueprint for the advanced learning prohibition policy, which was one of President Park Geun-hye's signature education campaign promises.\\n○ Both Classes and Tests Prohibited\\nThe bill focuses on prohibiting advanced learning across three stages: elementary, middle, and high school curricula; middle and high school admission processes; and university admission processes.\\nFirst, in elementary, middle, and high schools, both teaching and testing content that exceeds the curriculum established by the state and metropolitan/provincial offices for each grade and semester is prohibited. For example, according to the national curriculum, multiplication tables are assigned to the second semester of elementary school second grade, so related content cannot be taught or included in tests until the first semester of second grade. The bill specifies that school principals must provide guidance and supervision to prevent advanced education.\\nThis principle also applies to after-school programs at elementary, middle, and high schools. This is to prevent some middle and high schools from teaching upper-grade level content after school under the pretext of advanced classes or differentiated instruction.\\nElementary, middle, and high schools are prohibited from creating content that exceeds the scope and level of the curriculum students have learned in all school examinations, including written assessments and performance assessments. The same applies to internal academic competitions that only select students participate in.\\nMiddle and high school and university admissions are also prohibited from including content that requires or induces advanced learning. This means that middle schools must limit entrance exams to the scope and level of elementary school curriculum, high schools to middle school curriculum, and universities to high school curriculum.\\n○ Regular Review and Punishment\\nWhether schools implement or induce advanced learning will be monitored by the Curriculum Operation Review Committee under the Ministry of Education and the Metropolitan/Provincial Curriculum Operation Review Committees under metropolitan and provincial superintendents of education. These committees will regularly review and investigate individual school classes and examinations.\\nWhen problems are identified, the Minister of Education or the superintendent of education will issue corrective orders to the relevant schools. Schools that do not comply will face administrative disciplinary procedures. For elementary, middle, and high schools, this includes teacher disciplinary actions and suspension or reduction of financial support; for universities, this includes suspension or reduction of financial support and enrollment quota reductions.\\nThe Ministry of Education has begun reviewing specific enforcement ordinances based on the special bill. The plan is to explicitly designate all examinations, including diagnostic assessments conducted by external organizations such as metropolitan and provincial education offices, as subjects for advanced learning prohibition, in addition to school-administered tests. The Ministry of Education plans to conduct policy research for more than three months and release enforcement ordinances by the end of the year for implementation starting next year.\\nPrior to this special bill, the 'Special Act on Regulating Advanced Education' proposed by Democratic United Party Representative Lee Sang-min designated even hagwon education institutions' advanced instruction as subject to administrative penalties (cancellation of hagwon registration).

These days he studies Korean and English Type B during the day and Korean and English Type A at night. Why is he living this 'double life'? Starting with the 2014 academic year CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), students must choose either Type A or Type B for Korean, math, and English.\\n\\nHere's his story. Lee, who ranks around 20th out of 42 students in his class, decided to study Type A for Korean, English, and math with the goal of entering a Seoul university or a popular department at a metropolitan area university. But problems arose. His school's regular humanities classes were all conducted focused on Type B for both Korean and English, making it impossible to prepare for Type A. While Type A classes were offered as after-school programs, the absolute amount of study was insufficient compared to regular classes. Eventually, he recently enrolled in Korean and English single-subject hagwons that offer Type A customized classes. The tuition is 150,000 won [approximately $115 USD] per month per subject.\\n\\nLee said, \\\"Since we use EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) Type B workbooks as textbooks during class time, I have to buy both Type A and Type B workbooks in addition to the Type A ones,\\\" and \\\"While the school discourages middle-to-lower tier students from choosing Type B, the actual classes are centered around Type B.\\\" 》\\n\\nRecently, the learning and hagwon education costs are increasing for students preparing for Type A in the 2014 optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam). The photo shows high school senior Student A in Seoul studying with both EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) Type B workbooks used in school classes and Type A workbooks she actually studies stacked together.\\n\\nRecently, many middle-to-lower tier and arts/physical education students preparing for Type A in the optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) are experiencing increased learning and hagwon education cost burdens and expressing difficulties. The optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) was introduced with the intention of reducing the learning burden on middle-to-lower tier students, but this phenomenon occurs because actual school classes are centered around top-tier students who choose Type B.\\n\\nMany high school teachers unanimously say, \\\"Most major universities in Seoul require Korean Type B, Math Type A, and English Type B for humanities tracks, and Korean Type A, Math Type B, and English Type B for science tracks. From the perspective of high schools where college admission results are important, they have no choice but to conduct classes centered on Type B.\\\"\\n\\nEBS Workbook Purchase Costs Double\\n\\nMany students preparing for Type A exams are seeing increased workbook purchase costs compared to before the introduction of the optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam). Since the introduction of the optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), Korean, math, and English EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) materials are published separately as Type A and Type B versions, and since many schools use EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) Type B workbooks as class materials and reflect them in school exams, students have no choice but to purchase both Type A and Type B workbooks.\\n\\nHigh school senior Ryu in Seoul said, \\\"Middle-tier students preparing for Type A often study Type B during regular class time but take Type A classes in after-school programs.\\\" In fact, EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) materials linked to the 2014 CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) include 5 Type A and 5 Type B books each for Korean, and 6 each for English. If all these materials are purchased, it totals 22 books, which is about double the 12 books that were the total number of Korean and English linked materials last year.\\n\\nHigh school senior Kim in Incheon said, \\\"Students preparing for Type A often purchase EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) Type B workbooks used as supplementary materials, Type A workbooks they study individually, and workbooks published by general publishers for both Type A and Type B preparation.\\\"\\n\\nGoing to Hagwons to Take Type A Classes\\n\\nThe number of students enrolling in hagwons or getting private tutoring to take Type A classes is also increasing. This phenomenon is prominent in English, where most students choose Type B. In fact, 82.5% of students chose English Type B in the June evaluation institute mock exam.\\n\\nFor this reason, most schools do not offer English Type A classes during regular class hours. Many middle-to-lower tier students and arts/physical education track students studying English Type A rely on hagwon education. The same applies to students preparing for Korean Type A in humanities tracks or Math Type A in science tracks.\\n\\nHigh school senior Lee in Seoul, who is preparing for art college admission, said, \\\"Regular classes are conducted only in Type B for both humanities and science tracks,\\\" and \\\"I've been attending an English hagwon that offers Type A classes since last month.\\\"\\n\\nSome schools even make Type A students take Type B mock exams. Since teachers also have no experience teaching the optional CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), they cannot predict which type - A or B - would be advantageous for college admissions, so they have students prepare for both types for now. However, for students preparing for Type A, this means taking one more unnecessary exam.\\n\\nIn fact, a high school in Busan had all third-year students take March and April mock exams in Type B, then retake the English Type A exam the next day. A high school senior Lee at this school said, \\\"For the June mock evaluation, we plan to take both English Type A and Type B mock exams over two days.\\\"\\n\\nType A Classes Have Worse Classroom Atmosphere\\n\\nThere are criticisms that the classroom atmosphere has worsened compared to before in schools that gather Type A students for classes.\\n\\nA Korean teacher Lee at a high school in Incheon complained about the difficulty, saying, \\\"When teaching Korean Type A classes to top science track students, classical Chinese texts are presented in modern Korean rather than archaic language, so the problems are easier and students listen to class even less than before.\\\" There are also claims that problems surrounding Type A will intensify if more students switch from Type B to Type A after the June evaluation institute mock exam.\\n\\nA teacher who is a third-year department head at a high school in Gyeonggi Province said, \\\"It's not easy for a student who has been studying Type B to suddenly switch to Type A. Type A and Type B don't just differ in problem difficulty - the problem types themselves are different, so separate preparation is needed.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4221, "output_tokens": 1718, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

During the free semester, students will not take midterm or final exams. Starting with pilot operations at 42 research schools from September this year, the system will gradually expand to be applied to all middle schools by 2016. This represents a major change in education.\\n\\nIf the admissions officer system was the core project of the Lee Myung-bak administration, the free semester system is the representative education pledge of the Park Geun-hye administration. The aim is to free students from exam pressure so they can find their own dreams and talents, developing creativity, character, and self-directed learning abilities—the competencies required by future society. William Damon, a renowned professor at Stanford University and expert in human development research, analyzed that the anxiety and helplessness commonly appearing among youth worldwide stems from a lack of life direction and sense of purpose. While today's university students can engage in various activities through exchange programs and internships, the reality is that middle and high school students become slaves to exams.\\n\\nHaving one 'exam-free semester' among the 24 semesters of elementary through high school education should not cause major disruption to the curriculum. The intent of the free semester system—exploring long-term life goals rather than short-term goals like exams—is worthy of support. However, good intentions do not guarantee success. First, with high school and university admission processes remaining unchanged, there is a possibility that parents and students anxious about declining academic performance will rush toward hagwon education. Although the Ministry of Education says it will not reflect learning achievement levels during the free semester in high school admissions, it is questionable how much effort parents and students will put into educational curricula unrelated to admissions.\\n\\nThe core of the free semester system is full-time career exploration activities—namely, job experience. For example, a student who wants to become a cartoonist would enter as an apprentice to a working cartoonist, experience the process of creating comics, and receive academic credit for this. This system can only succeed if it can supply diverse programs that satisfy students' interests and aspirations with help from various professional organizations. However, the infrastructure of substantial experience institutions and professional instructors is severely lacking, creating the possibility of merely wasting time or providing only superficial experiences. A rich-get-richer, poor-get-poorer phenomenon could emerge in experiential activities depending on parents' capabilities.\\n\\nEducational authorities must thoroughly examine through pilot operations whether this can be established as a stable educational system before full implementation. Parents and students are growing weary of education policies that dance according to each administration. The success of the free semester system depends not on schools and students, but on how much support businesses and local communities provide. We must start by building networks of businesses, institutions, social organizations, and professional groups.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2826, "output_tokens": 671, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The core policy the government has introduced for this purpose is the so-called 'Advanced Learning Ban Act (Public Education Normalization Act)'.\\n\\nThe policy stipulates that if hagwons teach content that goes beyond the scope of the school curriculum or ahead of the prescribed class schedule, this will be defined as a factor that disrupts normal public education operations and will be strictly cracked down upon.\\n\\nHowever, the problem of overheated hagwon education does not seem likely to be easily resolved. Let's hear the story of Ms. A, who is both a teacher and a parent.\\n\\nMs. A, an elementary school teacher in the Gyeonggi region, is a working mom with a daughter in 8th grade. Until last summer, she had never sent her daughter to the supplementary hagwons that 'everyone else sends their kids to.' The only study materials on her daughter's bookshelf were EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) materials. Her grades averaged over 90 points across four subjects: Korean, math, social studies, and science. Ms. A had no particular reason to worry about her daughter's studies. Moreover, with three active teachers living in one house—Ms. A, her husband, and her nephew—she thought there was even less need to send her daughter to a hagwon.\\n\\nIt was before the start of the second semester last year that Ms. A took her daughter's hand and visited a local supplementary hagwon. Ms. A was shocked when she saw her daughter's first semester grades. Her English and math scores were in the 70-80 point range. Some subjects had plummeted to the 50s. Even her husband, who had unconditionally rejected hagwons, decided to send their daughter to a hagwon for advanced learning in English and math for one semester, judging that 'maintaining grades with school studies alone would be difficult.'\\n\\nMs. A thought that her daughter's school, which is particularly notorious for fierce academic competition among schools in the Bundang area of Gyeonggi [a wealthy district south of Seoul], where educational fervor runs as hot as in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], makes exams excessively difficult.\\n\\nCurrently, so-called 'absolute evaluation' (achievement assessment system) is implemented for 7th and 8th graders, so school exams should be sufficient at a level that measures whether individual students have reached educational goals. However, Ms. A's analysis was that teachers have no choice but to make problems excessively difficult due to the fierce demands from parents to 'make exams more difficult.' In particular, she thought that to get all the essay-type and descriptive problems correct—which have an expanded proportion in school exams—would be practically difficult with school classes alone.\\n\\nWhat were the results of Ms. A sending her daughter to a hagwon for advanced learning for one year? Her daughter's mid-term exam scores for the first semester of 8th grade, taken a month ago, were: Korean 96 points, English 84 points, math 78 points. What surprised the couple was that their daughter not only liked receiving advanced learning classes at the hagwon but actually 'enjoyed' them. Ms. A said, 'Even when I usually taught my daughter math, I tried to develop her thinking and creativity as much as possible by saying \\\"let's think about it this way,\\\" but my daughter said the hagwon's teaching method of pinpointing core concepts and problem-solving methods was much more helpful.'\\n\\nMs. A acknowledged that 'the reality is that students who continue advanced learning at hagwons have relatively higher test scores,' but drew the line by saying, 'While sitting in hagwons for long hours and repeatedly training on large quantities of problem-solving might help you get test questions right immediately, it cannot be seen as improving academic \\\"competency\\\" for self-directed learning.'\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3113, "output_tokens": 942, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The evaluation institute itself revealed that \\\"both Type A and Type B were created at a level similar to the 2013 CSAT.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, admissions experts offered many analyses that both Type A and Type B were more difficult than last year's CSAT Language section.\\n\\nThis is because last year's Language section was extremely easy. Lee Chi-woo, director of the admissions strategy research center at Bisang Edu, stated, \\\"If the same student took both Type A and Type B, there would probably only be about a 2-3 point difference in raw scores. There wasn't much difference in difficulty.\\\"\\n\\nAnalysis also emerged that the EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] textbook connection rate was 75.6% for Type A and 71.1% for Type B, creating a slight difficulty difference in the connection rate.\\n\\n○ Mathematics... Type A easier than existing Mathematics 'Na', Type B questions 21 and 30 are high-difficulty items\\nGrade 1 cutline around 92 points\\n\\nIt can be understood that the existing CSAT's Mathematics 'Ga' type changed its name to Mathematics Type B, and Mathematics 'Na' type became Mathematics Type A. The point that selection is heavily influenced by students' grades remains the same. The question style was also at the level that repeats every year.\\n\\nJust as mid-level science track test-takers in the past often chose Mathematics 'Na' type, there is high probability of gradually concentrating on Type A in this year's CSAT as well. Type B selectors in this mock exam were only 34.7%.\\n\\nType A received many evaluations that it was easier compared to the existing Mathematics 'Na' type. On the other hand, Type B included some items that were difficult even for high-achieving students, including 4-point questions, leading to many reactions that the perceived difficulty was higher than the existing Mathematics 'Ga' type. Questions 21 and 30 were identified as high-difficulty items.\\n\\nKim Young-il, director of Kim Young-il Education Consulting, diagnosed, \\\"They differentiated by varying the point allocation for the same questions in Type A and Type B, or by transforming multiple choice to short answer while dealing with the same concepts.\\\" Oh Jong-woon, evaluation director at Etoos Cheongsol, predicted, \\\"The Grade 1 cutline by type is probably around 92 points for both Type A and Type B.\\\"\\n\\nIf this trend continues, many science track test-takers may switch to Mathematics Type A in the actual CSAT, while Type B test-takers could be very few. If this happens, the variable is that Type B test-takers could receive quite low grades despite receiving similar raw scores.\\n\\n○ English... Largest difficulty gap between Types A and B\\n\\\"All aspects including vocabulary usage frequency differentiated\\\" Expected to serve as gauge separating grades 1 and 2\\n\\nThe gap between Type A and Type B was very large. Some high school seniors burst into tears immediately after the English test ended, saying they had botched the Type B test.\\n\\nThe Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation explained their question-setting intent: \\\"We intended to maintain an appropriate level difference between Types A and B. We applied differentiation to all aspects: the ratio of practical English to basic academic English, vocabulary usage frequency numbers, word count per passage, complexity, passage comprehension difficulty, and attractiveness of wrong answer choices.\\\"\\n\\nEnglish school teachers diagnosed that Type B was at a similar or more difficult level compared to last year's Foreign Language section, where perfect scorers fell far short of 1%. They particularly expected that with many high-difficulty questions, it would have a decisive impact on distinguishing between grades 1 and 2. Kim Myung-chan, evaluation director at Jongro Academy, said, \\\"If Type B's difficulty is 100, Type A is about 70.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that identical questions have different point allocations in Type A and Type B also draws attention. For example, among common questions, 2 listening questions and 3 reading questions were worth 3 points in Type A and 2 points in Type B.\\n\\nAdmissions experts predicted that this mock exam would influence mid-level and below test-takers to switch to Type A. This is because if they receive grade 5 or below in Type B, they become too disadvantaged in standard scores and percentiles even when applying to universities that give bonus points for Type B.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3929, "output_tokens": 1505, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Ye-seul, who couldn't focus on school classes or hagwon classes and only studied when forced to, participated in TMD Education Group's career advancement program at her mother's recommendation.\\n\\nThrough this program, Ye-seul came to know herself and learned about what she likes and dislikes, and her special characteristics. Later, as she learned specifically what fields she was interested in and what jobs existed in those fields, she began to seriously contemplate her career path and found her own dream.\\n\\n'I want to enter Yonsei University and become a PD like Kim Tae-ho PD.'\\n\\nOf course, she didn't just start dreaming. She came to precisely understand what preparations she needed to make now to become a PD, and began studying hard to meet her future self who had achieved her dreams. Most importantly, she says the biggest change was that she began dreaming and contemplating her career path and making efforts on her own.\\n\\nLike this, career education has the special power to make children who absolutely won't respond even when forced to study move by their own strength. South Korea, which had been stigmatized as a country that despite having high IQs, passionate education fever, and the world's highest university enrollment rate, failed to produce talent in various fields, is now running toward the new goal of cultivating global talent.\\n\\nIs this why? The education world is now heated with the topic of 'career path.'\\n\\nPresident Park Geun-hye indicated her strong commitment to career education from her inaugural address, saying 'I will cultivate individual dreams and talents to change our society from one focused on educational background to one focused on ability.' In line with this, the government decided to introduce and expand the 'Free Semester System' in middle schools. Additionally, they decided to deploy 5 'Parent Career Coach Groups' with professional expertise per school and assign at least one career advancement counseling teacher per school.\\n\\nNow, career path is emerging as an important element not only in school curriculum but also in high school and university admissions. However, existing career education content consisting only of career aptitude tests and job experience seems insufficient to keep up with the changed educational environment.\\n\\nTMD Education Group is presenting Korea's first career coaching program 'Haengjin.'\\n\\n'Happy Career Coaching - Haengjin' is a coaching program containing the essence of career guidance clinically researched over the past 6 years with 300 schools and 20,000 students. The Haengjin career coach program, which provides career coach certification acquisition, advanced career assessment utilization rights, coaching and instructional material utilization rights, and future qualifications for career coaching activities in after-school programs/hagwons, can be participated in by hagwon directors, instructors, those hoping to start businesses in education, education field personnel interested in career advancement, parents interested in their children's career advancement coaching, and all people interested in career paths.\\n\\nAn official from 'Happy Career Coaching: Haengjin,' which expressed great ambitions to become a new model for educational content, announced that starting June 14th, they will hold business information sessions for people with curiosity about career paths.\\n\\nThe 'Haengjin' launch business information session, conducted through lectures by Professor Go Bong-ik, consists of content including analysis of the educational market environment being reorganized around career paths and advancement, career advancement coaching success cases, specific educational models for career advancement coaching (consulting/12-week coaching/1-year coaching/personal statement coaching/interview coaching/portfolio coaching/reading coaching), and introduction of the Haengjin coach model.\\n\\nThe Haengjin grand launch business information sessions will be held in 5 cities - Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, and Gwangju - starting June 14th. Detailed locations and times are as follows:\\n\\n■ Seoul\\nJune 14th (Fri) 10:00~13:00 (Seoul) HLMC Seolleung Station Grand Lecture Hall\\nJune 18th (Tue) 10:00~13:00 (Seoul) HLMC Seolleung Station Grand Lecture Hall\\n\\n■ Daejeon\\nJune 19th (Wed) 10:00~13:00 (Daejeon) Dunsan Private School Pension Hall Auditorium\\n\\n■ Daegu\\nJune 20th (Thu) 10:00~13:00 (Daegu) Chamber of Commerce Conference Room\\n\\n■ Busan\\nJune 21st (Fri) 10:00~13:00 (Busan) Design Center Event Hall\\n\\n■ Gwangju\\nJune 24th (Mon) 10:00~13:00 (Gwangju) Chamber of Commerce Conference Room\\n\\nAll attendees will receive a gift of 'College Admission Success Role Model Story e-book' 5-pack (worth 15,000 won [approximately $11 USD]).

Provided by Real SAT\\n\\nWith winter break approaching, it's time to consider overseas English camps for elementary and middle school children. When looking for camps conducted in English-speaking countries like the United States or Britain, it's important to verify whether they are run by credible local educational institutions. Some private companies such as study abroad agencies require caution as they sometimes engage in exaggerated advertising, making it appear as if they jointly operate camps with famous universities when they merely rent university facilities or have students attend professors' special lectures.\\n\\nFor elementary and middle school parents with such concerns, consider 'Camp Vanderbilt,' an English camp jointly operated by Dong-A Ilbo as the organizer, Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and Real SAT Global, an independent corporation for junior students under Real SAT, which specializes in overseas university admissions.\\n\\nVanderbilt University was established by Vanderbilt, the 19th-century American 'railroad king.' It's a prestigious university that ranked 17th in the '2014 US News & World Report National University Rankings.'\\n\\nAll instructors are Ivy League graduates\\n\\nCamp participants receive education according to a customized program jointly developed by Dong-A Ilbo, Vanderbilt University, and Real SAT. Morning and afternoon classes are conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus.\\n\\nMorning classes directly experience the advantages of American-style education through theme-based practical programs supervised by Vanderbilt University, including: △egg drop experiment (science) △New Year celebrations by country (culture) △marketing project (business/economics) △program newspaper production (journalism). This differentiates the camp from many English camps that consist only of lecture-centered English study throughout the day. Through these programs, students can develop self-directed problem-solving abilities while also fostering creativity and logical thinking through discussions.\\n\\nVanderbilt University's programs are reconstructed versions of camps for American local students conducted at 'Peabody,' Vanderbilt University's education school, adapted for Korean students and led by local high school teachers affiliated with Vanderbilt University. In some courses, Vanderbilt faculty and admissions officers will participate to guide participating students.\\n\\nAfternoon classes proceed as 'instructor learning programs.' This is a process of building one's own knowledge based on the practical content learned in the morning. It consists of speaking and writing classes tailored to individual levels, research report writing, presentations, and other components.\\n\\nA distinctive feature is that all instructors are Ivy League graduates. Classes are conducted in discussion format, and a major advantage is the consideration given to keeping the student-to-instructor ratio at a maximum of 8 students per instructor to maximize educational effectiveness.\\n\\nDuring evening hours, participants work on individual winter break assignments at their accommodation—suite-style lodging facilities (hotels with living rooms) affiliated with Vanderbilt University—alongside their instructors, while also receiving supplementary learning for areas of weakness. Camp participants stay 2-4 people per room depending on room size and live together with their instructors.\\n\\nExperiencing American elite private schools\\n\\nOn weekends, participants engage in various extracurricular activities. In addition to outdoor activities such as primitive forest experiences, 1-night 2-day camping in log cabins, and horseback riding education, time is also arranged to visit famous American private boarding schools including Choate Rosemary Hall, Deerfield Academy, and Taft School to experience private school teaching methods and daily routines while touring campuses. Upon completing the camp, participants will receive a certificate of completion issued in the name of Vanderbilt University's president.\\n\\n'Camp Vanderbilt' plans to recruit around 32 students from 3rd grade elementary school through 3rd grade middle school. The program runs for 3 weeks from the 29th through January 17th of next year.\\n\\nEven after the camp program ends, a follow-up program that allows continued communication with the Ivy League graduate teachers who guided them through SNS services is another differentiating aspect.

It's because we're willing to take losses for the sake of educational quality\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Interview with Lee Hyeon, CEO of Sky Edu\\n\\nLee Hyeon, CEO of Sky Edu, a college entrance exam-specialized education company, has lived a life that suits the word 'challenge.' A representative example was establishing the Sky Edu hagwon in Seoul's Sinchon. Repeat test-taker hagwon [hagwons for students retaking CSAT after high school graduation] officials were negative, saying \\\"it would be hard to succeed.\\\" This was because the area around the university district was 'good for playing' and not an environment suitable for a repeat test-taker hagwon. However, Sinchon Sky Edu, which opened in 2006, achieved the remarkable feat of easily filling its enrollment quota of 950 students for regular repeat test-taker classes in its first year of operation. I recently met with CEO Lee at Sky Edu headquarters in Bangi-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul.\\n\\nPublic disclosure of student score improvement rates for educational company responsibility\\n\\nSky Edu has attracted attention in the education industry for its groundbreaking moves. CEO Lee explained, \\\"The goal achievement scholarship 'Sky Edu Scholarship Student' that provides a certain amount of scholarship money when students achieve their desired university or CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores, the publication of repeat test-taker success story collections, and the public disclosure of student CSAT score improvement rates all started with Sky Edu.\\\"\\n\\nThe goal achievement scholarship and public disclosure of student CSAT score improvement rates are extensions of CEO Lee's 'human-centered educational philosophy.' The Sky Edu Scholarship Student program originated in the 2007 academic year when a total of 150 million won [approximately $113,000 USD] was provided at 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] per person to 300 students who posted course reviews among Sky Edu's online course students and were admitted to their target universities and departments. Currently, Sky Edu Scholarship Students include △Half-tuition Scholarship Students △Academic Excellence Scholarship Students △Great Challenge Scholarship Students △Sky Edu Hagwon Scholarship Students △Score Improvement Scholarship Students △Hope Challenge Scholarship Students, with scholarship benefits becoming increasingly diverse.\\n\\nAnother characteristic is not selecting only top-tier university admits as scholarship recipients. Through Score Improvement Scholarship Students and Hope Challenge Scholarship Students, they find and provide scholarships to students whose CSAT scores have noticeably improved even if they don't have grades for top-tier universities, and students who didn't give up despite difficult circumstances. CEO Lee said, \\\"I think finding and encouraging these students is also the social responsibility of an educational company,\\\" adding \\\"I want to break the stereotype that you've only succeeded if you're admitted to a top-tier university.\\\"\\n\\nPublicly disclosing student CSAT score improvement rates starting from the 2010 academic year is also in this context.\\n\\n\\\"Previously, if hagwons just provided lectures that pinpointed key points, the hagwon's responsibility ended there. Student CSAT score improvement rates weren't important. We thought it was the individual's responsibility, not the hagwon's. Moreover, disclosing such information itself could be a big burden. But we decided to disclose it transparently. Based on this, we're giving trust to parents and students, and internally using it as an opportunity to find and improve shortcomings and conduct research so that our students can achieve even better results.\\\" (CEO Lee)\\n\\nCannot abandon educational quality for quantitative growth\\n\\nSky Edu's offline repeat test-taker hagwon, Sky Edu Hagwon, has a total of 5 locations: 4 directly operated hagwons including △Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] △Songpa △Sinchon △Namyangju boarding hagwon, and 1 franchise hagwon in △Incheon. Considering the annual sales scale exceeding 30 billion won [approximately $22.5 million USD], this is a relatively small scale. This is an unusual move compared to the phenomenon where competing hagwons are often interested in increasing directly operated and franchise hagwons.\\n\\nCEO Lee said, \\\"I'm thinking of not forcibly expanding the hagwon scale.\\\" This is because while sales and profit scale would grow as more hagwons are added, pursuing quantitative growth could potentially lower educational quality. CEO Lee revealed that his conviction is that educational quality cannot be compromised even if it means taking losses in the short term. He said that Sky Edu Hagwon's support for all essay-writing exam [a component of some university admissions] application fees and face-to-face correction costs for students is also in this context.\\n\\nAt Sky Edu Hagwon, the costs for essay-writing mock exams that students take 6 times a year to prepare for early admission processes, along with face-to-face correction guidance by professional instructors conducted twice per mock exam, are all free. CEO Lee said, \\\"Sky Edu Hagwon students' early admission acceptance rate reaches 30%,\\\" adding \\\"We spend hundreds of millions of won [approximately $150,000–750,000 USD] annually for this, but we plan to continue sparing no investment to secure our students' educational competitiveness.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3520, "output_tokens": 1250, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Students who passed early admission or received better CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores than expected will spend the year-end holidays in high spirits, but those who didn't are likely to finish the year feeling depressed. If there are test-takers who are unwillingly considering retaking [becoming a repeat test-taker after high school graduation to retake CSAT], they should analyze several factors before carefully deciding to retake.\\n\\nDoes attending a famous hagwon guarantee retaking success?\\n\\nWhen starting to retake, most test-takers think, 'I'll study harder during my retake year and hit it big on next year's CSAT.' This kind of thinking is extremely emotional and abstract.\\n\\nWhat should precede the decision to retake is reflecting on what caused one's failure in college admissions. If you start retaking without properly analyzing how you studied this year and what caused your failure, the possibility of repeating failure is very high.\\n\\nMost test-takers who decide to retake think they will succeed on the next CSAT by attending famous hagwons and studying, without analyzing themselves. However, among students who studied at famous hagwons, some succeed and some repeat failure. The reason for repeating failure is that they couldn't put what the hagwon taught them into their heads. If thorough analysis of the causes of this year's admissions failure comes first, you can raise learning efficiency and concentration during the retake period and succeed in the next admissions.\\n\\nIndependent retaking should develop problem analysis skills\\n\\nThe methods of retaking can be divided into several types. First, if you received grades of 4th level or below on average on this year's CSAT or think your willpower is lacking, I recommend building foundations at a hagwon near home or a boarding hagwon [residential hagwon where students live on-site]. In this case, it's good to receive systematic classes at the hagwon and study with the goal of achieving 3rd level or above grades through review. However, if you're in the 1st-3rd levels and only diligently attended hagwons during high school or studied at the level of diligently listening to internet lectures, I recommend 'independent retaking' - studying alone without attending hagwons. If you're in the upper ranks but fluctuate between upper-middle ranks without achieving satisfactory grades, it's highly likely because you have sufficient knowledge but lack training in analyzing CSAT problems and then applying knowledge to problems. In this case, establishing the habit of studying alone should be prioritized. Remember that you can expect good grades only by becoming familiar with repeatedly solving problems by type.\\n\\nYou might worry about retaking alone, but if your goal is top-tier universities, you must study a lot on your own for one year and become skillful at analyzing all problems to receive scores close to perfect. Keep in mind that the path to 'CSAT jackpot' lies in studying by yourself.\\n\\nSong Jae-yeol, Director of Test Master Study Method Research Institute\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2950, "output_tokens": 790, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
{"custom_id": "article_1079_1", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_01Ei75fzXp8TLvbFuGVsaV4q", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"\\\"One Well-Placed Monthly Rental... Better Than Ten Filial Sons\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Middle-aged and older adults entering residential rental business for retirement preparation\\n\\nMr. In (47), who runs a trading business, feels reassured these days when he thinks about the 'share house' he's renting out monthly in Yeonhui-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul. From the five-story studio-type share house he built three years ago for 1.5 billion won [approximately $1.13 million USD] as retirement preparation, he receives fixed monthly rent of about 20 million won [approximately $15,000 USD] from rooms renting for 550,000-600,000 won [approximately $415-452 USD] each. Unlike some officetels and urban living housing that can't find tenants due to oversupply, Mr. In's share house attracts nearby university students and foreign students, with all 37 studio units rented out.\\n\\nMr. In's share house is characterized by separating communal and private spaces, unlike typical studio apartments that cram kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom into one room. The first floor features a kitchen equipped with all cooking facilities for tenants to prepare their own meals, and a living room where they can watch TV or rest. Floors 2-5 are furnished as private rooms with bedrooms, bathrooms, and furniture. Mr. In said, \\\"Although maintenance and management costs are higher than regular studios due to having a separate building manager and communal spaces, the annual return rate is good at about 10% since tenants flock here and there are no vacant rooms.\\\"\\n\\n○ Various rental products targeting foreign demand\\n\\nDespite the sluggish housing market, middle-aged and older adults entering the residential rental business for retirement preparation are increasing. This is because the prolonged low-interest environment leaves few suitable investment options for spare money, while the increase in single-person households is driving up monthly rental demand.\\n\\nIndeed, the private rental market has continued growing in recent years. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the number of private rental business operators increased 45% in five years, from 37,457 at the end of 2007 to 54,137 at the end of last year. The proportion of single-person households among all households is also rising steeply: 15.5% in 2000, 20.0% in 2005, and 23.9% in 2010.\\n\\nEven ordinary people without abundant spare money are entering the rental business by investing 200-500 million won [approximately $150,000-377,000 USD]. They're achieving stable monthly rental income by breaking away from the conventional practice of renting to young Koreans and targeting foreign demand.\\n\\nDr. Oh (62) received information that so-called 'kkalsae' [lump-sum advance rent payment] was promising—where landlords don't receive security deposits from foreigners but instead receive several months to three years' worth of monthly rent at once. Last month, he purchased a 79㎡ residential officetel in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul for 210 million won [approximately $158,000 USD]. Dr. Oh recently rented this officetel to an American English hagwon instructor for 1.2 million won [approximately $904 USD] per month for two years. The condition was receiving 14.4 million won [approximately $10,850 USD]—one year's worth of monthly rent—at once without a security deposit.\\n\\n▼ 'Kkalsae' trend of receiving lump-sum monthly rent without security deposits ▼\\nMiddle-aged and older adults entering residential rental business\\n\\nDr. Oh said, \\\"It's comfortable not having to worry about overdue rent, plus the returns are more than double bank time deposits, which is good.\\\"\\n\\n○ Selling Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] homes to invest in provincial studio apartments\\n\\nSome people are reducing their owned homes and using the remaining money to enter the rental business.\\n\\nMr. Han (60), who retired from a bank last year, sold his apartment (109㎡) in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul] for 1 billion won [approximately $753,000 USD] and moved to a 400 million won [approximately $301,000 USD] apartment (109㎡) in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, using the 600 million won [approximately $452,000 USD] in hand as seed money for the rental business. Initially looking at officetels in the metropolitan area, Mr. Han heard that investing in studio apartments in provinces with good real estate markets would yield higher returns than the metropolitan area, so he recently purchased a four-story multi-family housing with 18 'full-option studios' equipped with convenience facilities in Daejeon. Although the house price was 550 million won [approximately $414,000 USD], Mr. Han invested only 213 million won [approximately $160,000 USD] by utilizing 237 million won [approximately $179,000 USD] in security deposits from jeonse and monthly rentals plus 100 million won [approximately $75,300 USD] in bank collateral loans. Mr. Han earns 2.9 million won [approximately $2,184 USD] in monthly rental income. This represents high returns of about 16% annually compared to actual investment.\\n\\nRental types that were previously concentrated mainly in officetels or urban living housing are recently expanding to 'serviced residences' (hotel-style rental residential facilities). Ms. Park (55, female), who lives in Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, purchased two units at the residence hotel 'Yongsan Cube' built in Munbae-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul for 300 million won [approximately $226,000 USD]. Since this place opened in June, Ms. Park has been receiving 820,000 won [approximately $618 USD] per unit monthly from the management company. Serviced residences have the advantage that property owners don't need to worry about individual tenants since contracted management companies find tenants and handle management.\\n\\n○ Reliable support for retirement preparation\\n\\nExperts evaluate that monthly rental for retirement preparation is highly preferred because elderly people without income can create stable cash flow. By carefully selecting investments in areas with high monthly rental demand such as Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] or university districts, annual returns of at least 6% are possible, allowing monthly cash income more than double bank time deposit interest rates (2.5-3%). The government's expansion of various financial and tax benefits to promote private rental business is also positive.\\n\\nPark Sang-eon, CEO of real estate consulting company UN R Consulting, said, \\\"The residential rental business has lower risk than stocks and the advantage of obtaining stable cash income after retirement,\\\" adding \\\"Investment options are also diversifying from the existing focus on officetels or multi-family housing to share houses and monthly rentals targeting foreigners.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4099, "output_tokens": 1653, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

On the 5th, an education company famous for online lectures opened the A boarding hagwon dedicated to PEET (Pharmacy Education Eligibility Test) in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province [a city southeast of Seoul]. This is the first adult-targeted boarding hagwon in Korea. A hagwon famous for police civil service exam preparation is also planning to open the B boarding hagwon with a capacity of 1,000 students by acquiring a 4-year university campus in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province.\\n\\nAmidst a prolonged recession where many education companies are struggling, why are they entering the adult-targeted boarding hagwon market that requires substantial initial investment costs? Industry insiders cite higher profitability compared to operating boarding hagwons for college entrance exam students as the primary reason.\\n\\nThe A boarding hagwon has a capacity of around 250 students. Compared to the similarly-sized college entrance-focused C boarding hagwon, the number of class hours that determine instructor fees (actual teaching hours that form the basis for calculating instructor compensation) is significantly reduced. The A boarding hagwon's weekly class hours are 32 hours. This is more than 10 hours less compared to the 40-45 hour level of similarly-sized C boarding hagwon. This is due to the difference in the number of subjects for the Pharmacy Education Eligibility Test and CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam).\\n\\nThe Pharmacy Education Eligibility Test consists of 4 subjects: △General Physics △General Chemistry △Organic Chemistry △Biology, but CSAT includes △Korean △Mathematics △English △Social Studies (10 subjects) △Science (8 subjects), and even requires essay-writing exam instructors for early admission preparation. Labor costs are reduced compared to operating college entrance boarding hagwons, allowing for relatively higher profit margins.\\n\\nAdditionally, adult-targeted boarding hagwons are free from various regulations under the existing hagwon law. College entrance boarding hagwons are designated as 'school subject tutoring hagwons' that teach students from schools under Article 2 of the 'Elementary and Secondary Education Act' according to hagwon law, and are subject to strict management and supervision by education offices regarding facilities, instructor standards, and tuition setting. However, adult-targeted boarding hagwons are registered as 'lifelong education vocational hagwons' under hagwon law and are not subject to such regulations.\\n\\nFor example, the C boarding hagwon, which is a school subject tutoring hagwon, cannot separately charge membership fees or uniform costs in addition to the monthly tuition of approximately 2.3 million won [approximately $1,750 USD]. However, the A boarding hagwon, which is a lifelong education vocational hagwon, can demand a membership fee of 500,000 won [approximately $380 USD] and separate uniform costs in addition to the monthly tuition of 2.2 million won [approximately $1,675 USD].\\n\\nAnalysis suggests that the recent ease in securing facilities for adult boarding hagwons, which allows for savings in initial investment costs, has also influenced the increase in adult-targeted boarding hagwons.\\n\\nA boarding hagwon official said, \\\"Recently, quite a few boarding hagwons have closed due to operational difficulties and are on the market, so we don't necessarily need to purchase buildings and can just sign rental contracts,\\\" adding \\\"The A boarding hagwon is also using a building through a rental contract. Since there are so many boarding hagwons waiting for owners, education companies can proceed with favorable contracts in the direction they want.\\\"\\n\\nThe situation where new markets must be developed as the school-age population decreases is also a factor driving entry into the adult boarding market.\\n\\nWhile students taking college entrance exams are decreasing, demand from so-called 'gongsi-jok' [a term referring to civil service exam preparation students] who aim for professional jobs like doctors and pharmacists and stable civil service positions is steadily increasing.\\n\\nAn official from a Pharmacy Education Eligibility Test specialist hagwon in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] said, \\\"About 15,000 students took the 2014 Pharmacy Education Eligibility Test,\\\" adding \\\"The number of test-takers has continued to grow from 10,000 in 2011 when the first test was administered, to 12,194 in 2012, and 13,142 in 2013.\\\"\\n\\nAn official from a civil service exam hagwon in Noryangjin [a Seoul district known for civil service exam preparation hagwons] said, \\\"The adult boarding hagwon market has opened as the anxious psychology of job seekers who want to prepare for exams in a more reliable way amid increasingly fierce competition has aligned with the interests of education companies seeking new blue oceans,\\\" adding \\\"Depending on the results produced by companies that have just entered the adult-targeted boarding hagwon business, there is a high possibility that third and fourth adult boarding hagwons will emerge.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3500, "output_tokens": 1235, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
