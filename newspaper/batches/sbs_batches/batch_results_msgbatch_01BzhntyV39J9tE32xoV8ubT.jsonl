Right now there are no classes, so attendance isn't that strict, so it's not really a problem.]The issue is that it's difficult for students to receive proper essay-writing instruction at school. Although there's about a month between the CSAT and winter break, most high schools don't offer essay-writing courses, making them virtually in a state of closure.[Kim Yu-ni/High School Senior: These days? We read books, chat, or sleep.] Since the types of essays vary so much by university and department, school teachers express frustration that realistically guiding students is difficult.[Lee Moon-haeng/High School Teacher: I think there's a clear difference between students who receive guidance through hagwon education and those who don't.]The college entrance essay-writing exams are gaining more weight each year.

Long lines form as people wait to attend a university admission information session hosted by a college admissions agency. There are about 10,000 attendees in total.

By the time they enter kindergarten, there are already differences in individual students' capabilities, and these differences widen further as they progress through elementary, middle, and high school. According to survey results published annually by the Ministry of Education, the number of students failing to meet basic academic standards increases significantly from elementary to high school.\\n\\nIn this situation, middle school teachers, and especially high school teachers, find it extremely difficult to conduct classes. 'What level of student should I tailor my teaching to?' is always a major concern for teachers. It's not easy to cater to either high-achieving students or low-achieving students. Therefore, teachers have no choice but to select 'average-level instruction.' This means somewhat arithmetically averaged instruction that as many students as possible can understand and participate in. High-achieving students may not find such classes very interesting because they already know the content being taught. For the opposite reason, low-achieving students won't be interested either.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, the Ministry of Education has decided to implement ability-based instruction starting in 2008, beginning with 7th and 10th grade students. Initially, students will be divided into upper, middle, and lower levels for English and mathematics classes, and textbooks will also be produced in three different levels according to ability.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education expects that changing from the current uniform instruction to instruction tailored to students' levels will increase student satisfaction with classes. They believe this will reduce wasted class time and eliminate the problem of hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] costs that arise from students taking school classes separately and hagwon classes separately. There are also expectations that this will have a positive impact on learning motivation, as students in lower-level classes can move up to intermediate or advanced classes based on their own efforts. Finland, which ranks first in the world for student academic achievement, is also said to be achieving results through public education alone without hagwon education, using ability-based customized instruction.\\n\\nHowever, there are many challenges that must be resolved before 'ability-based instruction' becomes completely established. The opportunity costs involved in transitioning to ability-based instruction are enormous. There's the issue of discord among students, as well as the burden of needing additional classrooms for ability-based instruction and requiring about 1.5 times more teachers. Also, if students' efforts to 'ascend' to advanced classes become excessive, hagwon education focused on preparing for advancement to higher-level classes could actually increase.\\n\\n'Assessment' also seems likely to be an important key determining the success or failure of ability-based instruction. It's said that school records [GPA] will carry greater weight in university admissions [college entrance exams] going forward, but how to evaluate and compare students who have been taught by different teachers using different textbooks seems like a far from easy problem.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2878, "output_tokens": 649, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Not only current students but even teachers are receiving essay-writing 'training.' Our education beat reporter Lee Byung-hee is here with today's education news. I understand that the new types of essay-writing exam questions are quite challenging, and teachers also need to study in advance using their vacation time?\\n\\n<Reporter> Yes, until now, when it came to essay-writing exams, schools had essentially given up. Students mostly attended private hagwons to prepare for essay-writing exams, but the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has now declared a strong commitment to having schools take responsibility for teaching essay-writing.\\n\\nThe education office has decided to strengthen essay-writing training for teachers first. About 200 high school teachers are attending essay-writing lectures. The lectures are conducted by current university professors who create essay-writing exam questions. Teaching methods for essay-writing that can be used in actual classes are being passed on to teachers.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education plans to train 1,200 teachers annually for 30 hours each, and will develop and distribute an essay-writing instruction manual by the second semester... The goal is to provide teachers with solid essay-writing education so there will be no shortcomings in guiding students. However, voices among teachers are emerging that more fundamental problems need to be resolved.\\n\\n[Song Chang-hyun/Korean Language Teacher at Sundeok High School: It's not just essay-writing, but there's also CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] and other school records [GPA]. Can we really conduct essay-writing classes while excluding all of those?]\\n\\n[Jung Hyun-i/Korean Language Teacher at Gyeongin High School: The most important thing about essay-writing classes is individual guidance, but there are too many students.]\\n\\nThe reality has been that in university admissions, public education has been neglected compared to hagwon education. There's growing interest in whether public education can take the initiative this time in the new admissions system where essay-writing is strengthened.\\n\\n<Anchor> I understand that CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores have been found to be quite closely related to household monthly income and parents' educational background?\\n\\n<Reporter> Yes, that's correct. We recently reported that hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] costs differ by as much as 8 times depending on income inequality... This time, noteworthy results have emerged showing that parents' economic power has a direct relationship with students' CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores.\\n\\nWhen Korea University Professor Kim Kyung-geun analyzed the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores of 1,500 students who entered university this year, those with parents earning less than 3 million won [approximately $2,250 USD] per month scored 291 points. However, those with parents earning 5 million won [approximately $3,750 USD] or more scored 316 points. That's a 26-point difference based on income.\\n\\nHigh-income parents spend on average more than 3 times as much on hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] as low-income parents. Students' CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores also show large differences based on parents' educational background. If the father has a doctoral degree or higher, the child's CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] score averages 336 points. Children of high school graduate parents score 294 points. If middle school graduates, 279 points. That's a difference of as much as 56 points.\\n\\nThis shows that CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] score gaps ultimately occur based on parents' economic power. The problem is that this vicious cycle of educational inequality continues repeatedly. Sustained attention is needed for low-income children who have relatively outstanding academic achievement abilities.\\n\\n<Anchor> There isn't much time left until the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] now, is there? Exactly 100 days were left on Liberation Day [August 15]. Please summarize the final CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] preparation strategies.\\n\\n<Reporter> Yes, the real CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] countdown has begun. In some ways, these 100 days might feel like quite a short time, but according to one survey result, it's possible to raise scores by 3 to 5 points in each subject area during these 100 days.\\n\\nLet's look at the screen. This is a classroom of high school seniors who have forgotten about vacation. The books they've studied so far are stacked up in boxes like mountains. Students naturally feel a lot of pressure.\\n\\n[Lee Dong-yun/High School Senior: I haven't accomplished much, but now there's no time left, so the time pressure is intense.]\\n\\n[Tae Ki-yeon/High School Senior: Since time is very limited, I'm reducing sleep to study, which is physically very burdensome.]\\n\\nStrategy is important during the remaining 100 days. First, you need to decide whether to apply for second-semester early admissions or not. If your CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores are much better than your school records [GPA], it's better to focus on regular admissions, and in the opposite case, it's better to focus on second-semester early admissions.\\n\\nGenerally, repeat test-takers [students retaking CSAT after high school graduation] are traditionally strong in regular admissions, so current students who rank in the middle or above in their class need to actively target second-semester early admissions.\\n\\nNow test-takers need to make good choices and focus. It's important to narrow down target universities to 3 to 5 places and prepare to get good scores in the subject areas those universities reflect, especially in areas with weighted scores.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3650, "output_tokens": 1461, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The two leaders held a summit meeting that day and discussed such measures, stating that \\\"North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is absolutely unacceptable,\\\" according to Song Min-soon, Senior Presidential Secretary for Security Policy. President Bush said in a press briefing after the meeting, \\\"I want North Korean leaders to know that if North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons and nuclear ambitions, we will enter into consultations on providing security guarantees and economic incentives for North Korea.\\\" White House spokesperson Tony Snow, in additional explanation regarding President Bush's statement that \\\"security and corresponding measures for North Korea will be provided if North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons,\\\" said that \\\"a formal declaration of the end of the Korean War could be included.\\\" He explained that the corresponding measures the U.S. would take \\\"include economic cooperation and strengthening ties in areas such as culture and education.\\\" Spokesperson Snow said, \\\"President Bush sees North Korea's announcement of returning to talks as a moment of opportunity,\\\" and \\\"the two leaders discussed the importance of cooperating within the six-party talks framework to make clear that North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons.\\\"\\n\\nResumption of Mortgage Loans\\nMajor commercial banks including Kookmin and Shinhan, which had suspended new mortgage loans on the 17th, decided to resume mortgage lending operations normally from this week. Banks that had completely suspended new loans following the financial supervisory authorities' de facto total loan volume control measures changed their stance and decided to provide mortgage loans to actual housing demanders. Kookmin and Shinhan banks, which had completely suspended new loans due to the Financial Supervisory Service's 'window guidance,' urgently sent official documents to each branch instructing them to provide loans to actual demanders as before. A Kookmin Bank official said on the 19th, \\\"We have withdrawn the plan to carry over new mortgage loans to December,\\\" and \\\"we plan to make 100% loans available especially to loan applicants who are in urgent financial situations due to real estate purchase contracts.\\\" Kim Jung-hoe, Deputy Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, said, \\\"Due to customer complaints about the suspension of new loans, we requested commercial bank working-level staff not to suspend new loans to actual demanders,\\\" and \\\"the FSS never requested commercial banks to implement total mortgage loan volume control in the first place.\\\" Meanwhile, from the 20th, the debt-to-income ratio (DTI) that limits mortgage loan amounts based on income will be applied not only to apartments over 600 million won [approximately $450,000 USD] in speculative zones but also to speculative overheated districts in the metropolitan area.\\n\\n'Seoul Reconstruction' Asking Prices Broken\\nSeoul reconstruction apartment price surges have fallen for the first time since Chuseok [Korean autumn harvest festival]. Although the price decline is not large, this is the first time Seoul apartment prices have fallen since Chuseok, leading to analysis that this is the beginning of a full-scale decline in asking prices. According to the real estate industry on the 19th, the 16-pyeong [approximately 580 sq ft] units in Seoul Godeok-dong Jugong Complex 3, which had risen by 50-70 million won [approximately $38,000-53,000 USD] in the past month, were asking 610-620 million won [approximately $460,000-470,000 USD] before the November 15 measures but are currently 600-605 million won [approximately $450,000-455,000 USD]. An official from a licensed real estate agent in Seoul Godeok-dong said, \\\"Homeowners' anxiety about price declines is growing, and urgent sales are appearing one by one.\\\" Seoul Gangdong-gu Dunchon Complex has also entered a wait-and-see phase, with listings gradually increasing and returning to a weak sideways trend. For Dunchon Jugong Complex 1's 16-pyeong units, asking prices that were 670-680 million won [approximately $505,000-515,000 USD] have dropped to 650-660 million won [approximately $490,000-500,000 USD]. Seoul Songpa-gu Jugong Complex 5 is also seeing an increasing number of urgent sales. The 34-pyeong [approximately 1,230 sq ft] units are showing 1.3-1.32 billion won [approximately $980,000-995,000 USD], and 36-pyeong [approximately 1,300 sq ft] units are in the 1.63-1.65 billion won [approximately $1.23-1.24 million USD] range. This represents a decline of about 10-20 million won [approximately $7,500-15,000 USD] from peak prices in the past month. An official from a licensed real estate agent in nearby Jamsil-dong said, \\\"Listings that were usually around 10 have increased to 15-20, but both sellers and buyers are taking a wait-and-see stance, so transactions are not occurring,\\\" adding \\\"there are many buyers waiting, so after a brief 'breather' phase, housing prices will fall further.\\\"\\n\\nAPEC Wrap-up... North Korea Nuclear Concern Oral Statement Achievement\\nThe 14th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit held in Hanoi, Vietnam, announced a chairman's oral statement regarding North Korea's nuclear program before closing on the 19th. Leaders from various countries expressed deep concern, devoting considerable portions of bilateral and multilateral meetings to the North Korean nuclear issue. President Roh Moo-hyun, speaking 19th in the second day of APEC meetings, announced that South Korea plans to contribute $2 million from 2007 to 2009 to an APEC support fund for capacity building in developing countries in the region. The fact that a separate oral statement on the North Korean nuclear issue was announced at APEC reflects that the 21 member country leaders shared the seriousness of the North Korean nuclear problem to that extent. However, it is known that leaders from various countries engaged in intense debate over the format and content of the statement. Ultimately, given that North Korea has expressed its intention to return to six-party talks and meetings are scheduled for next month, it was decided to issue an oral chairman's statement containing leaders' urging for substantial results rather than provoking North Korea. The chairman's oral statement is not an official document, so it has no binding force and takes the form of recommendations. According to government officials who attended APEC, the oral statement clearly expressed concern about North Korea's missile launch and nuclear weapons test, but focused on early resumption of six-party talks and substantial and effective measures based on last year's September 19 Joint Statement.\\n\\n'Fairy' Kim Yuna's First Adult Stage Victory\\n'Figure skating fairy' Kim Yuna (16, Gunpo Suri High School) achieved the feat of her first victory on the adult stage at the 2006-07 International Skating Union (ISU) Figure Skating Senior Grand Prix Series 4th competition. Kim Yuna scored the highest 119.32 points among 11 competitors in the women's singles free skating held at the Bercy Indoor Ice Rink in Paris, France on the 19th (Korea time), taking first place. Combined with the 65.22 points (1st place) she received in the short program held the previous day, she took overall first place with a total score of 184.54 points, beating Japan's Ando Miki (174.44 points). This is the first time in 100 years of Korean figure skating history that a Korean skater has won a gold medal on the ISU senior Grand Prix stage. Kim Yuna, who became the first Korean skater to win gold at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Slovenia last March, conquered the senior stage in just eight months, raising the possibility of gold at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.\\n\\n[JoongAng Ilbo] 'New City Housing Sales Possible from 2010, Not 2008'\\nDelayed over 2 years from government announcement due to post-completion sales system application. Although the government decided to significantly increase new city housing supply volume from 2008 through the November 15 real estate measures, it has been revealed that full-scale housing sales will only be possible from 2010. From 2010, the government plans to include household income and real estate assets as scoring factors through subscription system reform, making it virtually difficult for homeowners or high-income earners to enter new cities in popular areas like Songpa. According to the Ministry of Construction and Transportation on the 20th, with the revision of the land development project processing guidelines on the 17th, sales can only be conducted from next year after business approval and construction progress exceeds 40%. Public land supplied to private companies is also likely to adopt the post-completion sales system, as companies applying for post-completion sales are given priority in company selection. A Ministry of Construction and Transportation official said, \\\"According to this regulation, most new cities built in the future will be subject to the post-completion sales system,\\\" and \\\"considering that it takes 1-2 years to meet the 40% construction progress rate, actual sales will be possible 2 years after business approval.\\\" Furthermore, the government plans to strengthen the post-completion sales construction progress standard to 60% from 2009, so sales schedules for new cities like Songpa, Incheon Geomdan, Paju Phase 3, and Pyeongtaek are expected to be further delayed.\\n\\n[Hankyoreh] Anti-Yushin Movement Figure Tainted by Gift Certificate Corruption\\nPark Seong-hun (49), who was one of the key figures in Yonsei University's student movement in the 1970s, has been arrested by prosecutors on suspicion of adult arcade machine corruption. With Park's arrest by prosecutors, attention is focused on whether suspicions that game and gift certificate company officials approached figures who participated in the democratization movement to lobby for company selection will be clarified. Park led the 'Yonsei Democracy Defense Death Struggle Declaration' incident in October 1977, which is considered the largest anti-Yushin university student demonstration during the Park Chung-hee regime's 'Emergency Measure No. 9' period, which punished even critical remarks about the constitution. This demonstration, called the 'Muakgol Battle' in student movement history, began as a protest by Yonsei University students demanding the abolition of Yushin and the lifting of emergency measures, and expanded significantly as it spread to nearby Ewha Womans University and Sogang University. About 4,000 students came out of school gates for the first time since the declaration of Emergency Measure No. 9 in 1975, occupied the Sinchon area of Seoul, and engaged in fierce stone-throwing battles with police. Park was sentenced to one year in prison for this incident and is known to have subsequently devoted himself to the labor movement. The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Special Investigation Team announced on the 19th that Park is suspected of receiving 200 million won [approximately $150,000 USD] from a gift certificate issuing company (aggravated bribery under the Specific Crimes Aggravated Punishment Act). According to the prosecution's explanation, Park received a request from CEO Kim of Company H, which issues leisure culture gift certificates, in March 2005 to \\\"help get selected as a gift certificate issuing certification company,\\\" then told Kim that \\\"contact with Ministry of Culture or Game Industry Development Institute review committee members has been made,\\\" and received money the following month after Company H was selected as a gift certificate certification company.\\n\\n[Hankook Ilbo] Not One Follows 'Tuition Fee Standards'\\nIn a recent special crackdown by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, about 28% of hagwons were caught receiving high tuition fees exceeding government-set standards. However, when the Hankook Ilbo planning reporting team randomly selected 50 hagwons in Seoul and metropolitan areas - including supplementary education, college entrance exam preparation, essay-writing, and language hagwons - and investigated tuition fee collection practices from the 18th to 29th of last month, it was found that not a single hagwon properly followed government guidelines. This is analyzed to be because hagwons are employing clever methods such as false tuition fee posting, separate credit card payments, and depositing tuition fees into instructor-named accounts to avoid crackdowns, while government crackdowns remain superficial due to insufficient personnel and inadequate constant monitoring systems. According to our reporting team's investigation results, among all 50 target hagwons, 30 hagwons (60%) charged tuition fees 100% or more above the standard, with 10 of these (20%) exceeding 200%. The breakdown was 12 hagwons (24%) exceeding by 50-99%, and 8 hagwons (16%) exceeding by 1-49%. This differs significantly from the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's special crackdown conducted from July 23 to August 7, targeting 244 hagwons in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Yangcheon, and Nowon districts, which caught 68 hagwons (27.8% of total) violating tuition fee standards.\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Personal Bankruptcy Applications Expected to Exceed 100,000\\nDue to the impact of economic recession, personal bankruptcy applications this year are expected to exceed 100,000 for the first time in history. According to the financial sector and Supreme Court on the 19th, the number of personal bankruptcy applicants from the beginning of this year through September was 85,455, reaching 3.6 times the 23,708 from the same period last year and far exceeding last year's total of 38,773. Since April, monthly personal bankruptcy applicants have reached 10,000-11,000 levels, and if this trend continues, the total number of personal bankruptcy applicants for this year is expected to exceed 100,000 for the first time in history, reaching 110,000-120,000. Private research institute officials diagnose that while the number of applicants has increased due to relaxed bankruptcy application requirements, the fundamental cause is poor income and employment conditions.\\n\\n[Kukmin Ilbo] 'The Host' Wins 6 Awards at Korea Film Awards\\nThe film 'The Host' (produced by Chungeoram) proved to be this year's most talked-about film by winning 6 categories including Best Film and Best Director at the 5th Korea Film Awards. At the awards ceremony held from 6 PM on the 19th at Universal Arts Center in Neung-dong, Seoul, 'The Host' swept 6 categories including Best Film and Best Director, as well as Best Cinematography, Best Lighting, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound. The Best Actor award went to Jo In-sung for 'A Dirty Carnival'. The Best Actress award went to Jang Jin-young from 'Love, So Divine,' who appeared as a presenter in place of Jeon Do-yeon, who could not attend the ceremony. The Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards went to Lee Beom-soo from 'Running Wild' and Choo Ja-hyun from 'Between Love and Hate.' The Best New Actor award went to Lee Jun-ki, who delivered an outstanding performance in 'The King and the Clown.'\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] 'Floating Stage' Coming to Han River\\nFrom spring next year, it will be possible to enjoy cultural and artistic performances on a 'floating stage' on the Han River. Seoul Han River Citizens' Park Office announced on the 20th, \\\"From around April next year, we plan to allow cultural and artistic groups to install floating stages on the Han River and perform using Han River barges (flat-bottomed cargo ships).\\\" However, barges are reserved materials, and their conversion to other uses is prohibited, so they cannot be used as permanent stages and can only be utilized temporarily. The office is considering Nanji District's 1st Waterfront Stage as the primary candidate site for floating stage installation. This location already has a 3,000-seat tiered auditorium, so performances can be held immediately in front of audiences once the stage is installed.\\n\\n[Chosun Ilbo] 'Returned POW' No. 1 Jo Chang-ho Dies\\nAt the funeral hall for Reserve Lieutenant Jo Chang-ho (76), who died of chronic illness at 0:30 AM on the 19th at Bundang Seoul National University Hospital, his wife Yoon Shin-ja (66) was staring blankly at the portrait. \\\"He used to beat his chest, saying there are still many Korean War POWs in North Korea who are suffering from pneumoconiosis and dying slowly from harsh coal mine labor.

Ultimately, this school has still not found the student who stole B's money, and the incident was reported to police, who visited the school on the 14th to conduct an investigation.

Projects that received landfill permits but haven't started construction total 9 cases covering 13㎢, while projects with established landfill plans that haven't yet received permits total 36 cases covering 80㎢, including the Janghang National Industrial Complex construction project that would fill 12㎢ of tidal flats in Seocheon-gun, South Chungcheong Province.\\n\\n[Hankook Ilbo] \\\"Let's Create New Party Excluding President\\\" 49%\\n\\nAmong Uri Party lawmakers, more believe it would be preferable for President Roh Moo-hyun not to participate rather than participate if a pan-ruling camp integrated new party were established. Also, an overwhelming majority of lawmakers showed preference for establishing an integrated new party.\\n\\nAs a result of Hankook Ilbo's telephone survey of 140 Uri Party members on the 5th, among 102 respondents, 49% (50 people) answered that 'it would be preferable for President Roh not to participate in the new party,' while 38.2% (39 people) believed 'he should participate.' Lawmakers who withheld answers comprised 12.8% (13 people).\\n\\nThese results suggest the possibility that conflicts between pro-Roh and non-Roh factions within the party over President Roh's new party participation could intensify during future new party establishment discussions, and depending on circumstances, the party could split.\\n\\nRegarding the direction of political restructuring, the opinion that establishing an integrated new party encompassing the Uri Party, Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Goh Kun, and external reform forces including civic groups would be preferable was overwhelming at 78.4% (80 people). Only 16.7% (17 people) responded that party remodeling - recruiting some forces to the Uri Party and strengthening identity for re-establishment - would be preferable.\\n\\nThis reflects lawmakers' recognition that \\\"there is no hope as the current ruling party,\\\" foreshadowing that future ruling camp political restructuring discussions will inevitably flow toward an integrated new party. While integrated new party theory represents an absolute majority, the reason President Roh exclusion theory isn't proportionally high is analyzed to be due to judgment that the Yeongnam region stake that President Roh holds shouldn't be abandoned considering the next presidential election.\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Second-Tier Financial Institutions' Housing Collateral Ratios Too High... Over 70% Maximum\\n\\nSome second-tier financial institutions (non-bank financial institutions) including mutual savings banks and installment finance companies showed loan-to-value ratios (LTV) reaching the 70% range. Also, non-bank financial institutions' average housing collateral loan maturity was much shorter than commercial banks, with unexpectedly high fixed-rate loan proportions.\\n\\nAccording to the Bank of Korea's 'Financial Stability Report - Non-Bank Sector Soundness' released on the 5th, non-bank financial institutions including mutual finance, insurance companies, savings banks, Saemaul Geumgo, and installment finance companies showed average LTV in the mid-50% range as of late April. However, installment finance companies' LTV exceeded 70%, and savings banks also exceeded 60%.\\n\\n[Kookmin Ilbo] Employment Permit System 2 Years, Foreign Worker Wage Theft and Human Rights Violations Persist\\n\\nAlthough over two years have passed since the employment permit system was implemented, the number of detected illegal acts is actually increasing more than twofold each year. The Jeonju Regional Labor Office's inspection of 20 companies with many foreign employees in the province from January to late August this year for compliance with labor relations laws including the Labor Standards Act found 42 violations including unpaid severance pay and improper extension of working hours at 17 workplaces, representing 85%.\\n\\nThis is more than triple the 13 violations detected at 6 workplaces in 2004 before the employment permit system was implemented. Additionally, reports of illegal labor practices involving foreign workers during the same period increased more than twofold each year, from 6 cases in 2004 to 14 cases in 2005 to 25 cases this year.\\n\\nThe reason illegal labor practices persist despite employment permit system implementation is interpreted to be that company representatives still treat foreign workers with social prejudice and wrong perceptions. Also, workers' active pursuit of rights including immediate reporting of unfair labor practices since the system's implementation is one factor.\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] Gangneung University-Wonju University Merger Next March\\n\\nGangneung University and Wonju University will merge next March.

Kim left the federal detention center in Los Angeles where he had been imprisoned under escort by U.S. Federal Marshal agents in the early morning hours of the 15th (local time), departed for Los Angeles Airport, and was handed over to a prosecution escort team dispatched from Korea.

Regarding the mathematics 'Type A' section, which the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation said was somewhat difficult, students responded that it was easy. While hagwon education institutions analyzed that mathematics 'Type B' was \\\"difficult,\\\" many students reacted that it was \\\"moderate.\\\" The inquiry sections were generally evaluated as being at last year's level. Admissions experts evaluated that this year's CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], which introduced the '9-grade system' showing only grades rather than scores on report cards for the first time, succeeded in overall difficulty adjustment. They said that while there were some somewhat tricky questions, the level was generally similar to last year. The feared 'grade blank' phenomenon appears unlikely to occur. Students unanimously said that the language section was difficult, with the number of questions reduced by 10 and test time shortened by 10 minutes this year. Students' reaction to mathematics 'Type A' was \\\"it was easy.\\\" Jung Sung-bong, head of the question committee (professor at Korea National University of Education), stated, \\\"Overall, we tried to maintain last year's difficulty level and made efforts to secure discriminatory power by evenly distributing easy and difficult problems.\\\"\\n\\nRailway union and truckers' association postpone joint strike The railway union and truckers' association decided to postpone the joint strike that was to begin at 4 AM on the 16th.

The prosecution had no choice but to play its trump card by declaring independent investigation and inspection targeting even nominee Lim. The key issue was indeed securing 'fairness of investigation.' While it would take more than a month for the political sector to introduce a special prosecutor through procedures such as passing a special prosecutor law, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office Special Investigation Division 2, which was assigned the case, could not just sit idle. On the morning of the 15th, nominee Lim directly visited Prosecutor General Jung Sang-myung to discuss establishing an independent 'Special Investigation and Inspection Headquarters,' and its implementation was immediately decided. This also reflected the internal current that \\\"even if there are rice cake money prosecutors, the 'cutting out one's own flesh' should be done by the prosecution itself, not by outsiders (special prosecutors).\\\" The prosecution is making every effort to secure independence and fairness in establishing the Special Investigation and Inspection Headquarters.\\n\\nGyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong freight train to begin operation around December 11 South and North Korea have virtually agreed to operate the Gyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong freight train starting around December 11 next month.

The Fair Trade Commission announced on the 15th that it discovered Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors engaging in unfair subcontracting practices by unreasonably cutting parts prices from suppliers and not paying delayed interest, and issued orders for them to pay fines of 1.69 billion won [approximately $1.3 million USD] each and payments and interest of 4.6 billion won [approximately $3.5 million USD]. According to the Fair Trade Commission, Hyundai Motor set a goal of reducing parts material costs by 24.2 billion won [approximately $18.2 million USD] to improve the profitability of the small car 'Click' in January 2003, and uniformly lowered the unit prices of 789 types of parts from 26 suppliers by 3.4%. Also, from July 2004 to the end of October the following year, while paying supplier companies for export car parts 11 to 956 days later than the legal payment deadline, they did not pay the corresponding delayed interest of 118 million won [approximately $88,800 USD]. Hyundai Motor paid the delayed interest in a lump sum in May last year when the Fair Trade Commission's investigation was underway. Kia Motors verbally agreed with 34 companies making parts for 'Rio' and 'Optima' from June 2003 to the end of 2005 to lower unit prices and later compensate for losses by raising unit prices for 'Sorento' and 'Carnival' parts, but ordered the relevant suppliers to pay delayed interest of 2 billion won [approximately $1.5 million USD] added to the lowered supplier payments. A Hyundai Motor official stated, \\\"The Fair Trade Commission's findings are partial cases among all suppliers, and it is unreasonable to view the reflection of fixed cost reduction effects from increased production volume as uniform supplier price cuts,\\\" and \\\"We will review after receiving the official decision from the Fair Trade Commission and then take legal action.\\\"\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] Foreign language high school hagwon's practice test booklet written by foreign language high school teachers It was revealed on the 15th that a private hagwon specializing in special purpose high school admissions has foreign language high school teachers currently working at Seoul-area foreign language high schools write practice questions for foreign language high school admissions and makes them into test booklets to sell to students. This hagwon is the hagwon education company that holds the largest stake in Seoul Mokdong Jongno M Hagwon, which recently leaked admission questions from Gimpo Foreign Language High School. Hanul Education Co., Ltd., which promotes itself as a 'special purpose high school specialized admissions institution,' has published 'Foreign Language High School Interview Practice Test Booklets' since last April with English listening, language, and critical thinking questions written monthly by 10 current foreign language high school teachers in the Seoul area. The hagwon advertised it as 'exclusively published by our company,' saying \\\"questions directly developed by current foreign language high school teachers with experience as joint question writers for foreign language high school admissions.\\\" The preface of the test booklet states \\\"question types actually used in Seoul's 6 foreign language high schools and Gyeonggi-area foreign language high schools,\\\" revealing that each question was written by current foreign language high school teachers. Yoon Seok-won, director of Hanul Education's Educational Materials Research Institute, said, \\\"A total of 10 current Seoul-area foreign language high school teachers participated in question writing: 4 in English, 3 in mathematics, 2 in Korean, and 1 in social studies.\\\" Hanul Education stated, \\\"We asked current foreign language high school teachers to create test booklets with the intention of letting students preparing for special purpose high schools encounter proper types of practical questions.\\\"\\n\\n[Chosun Ilbo] Getting harder to find jeonse with 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] The number of apartments available for jeonse under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] has significantly decreased in the Seoul metropolitan area including Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon. According to real estate information company 'Real Estate Bank' on the 15th, among the total 3,028,778 apartment units in the metropolitan area, apartments available for jeonse under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] numbered 1,183,026 units (as of November 14), a decrease of 120,478 units (9.24%) over the past year. The decline was particularly pronounced in the relatively low jeonse Gangbuk [northern Seoul] area, which saw a decrease of 30,796 units. Gil Jin-hong, team leader at 'Real Estate Bank,' said, \\\"As housing prices rose significantly last year, demand for jeonse increased more than demand for home purchases, and jeonse prices also rose as small and medium-sized apartment prices in non-Gangnam [non-affluent southern Seoul] areas surged,\\\" and \\\"This trend will continue for the time being, further reducing the number of apartments under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] jeonse.\\\"\\n\\n[JoongAng Ilbo] Yeongdeungpo Prison moves after 61 years Yeongdeungpo Prison in Gocheok-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul, will be relocated to a greenbelt area in Cheonwang-dong, 3km away, by December 2010. Justice Minister Jung Sung-jin and Guro District Mayor Yang Dae-woong signed a 'memorandum of agreement on the relocation and new construction project of Yeongdeungpo correctional facilities' on the 15th. When the need for reconstruction arose due to the deteriorating Yeongdeungpo Prison facilities, Guro District Office proposed to the Ministry of Justice that the prison be relocated to the outskirts. Currently, apartments are built around Yeongdeungpo Prison with only a 12m road in between, so residents have been demanding the prison's relocation.\\n\\n[Hankyoreh] Kim Tae-hwan Jeju Governor's election law violation remanded ruling... maintains governorship The Supreme Court Grand Panel (Chief Justice Park Il-hwan) on the 15th overturned the lower court's sentence of a 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] fine in the appeal of Jeju Governor Kim Tae-hwan (65), who was indicted on charges of conspiring with Jeju Provincial Government officials to plan election campaigns ahead of the May 31 local elections last year (violation of the Public Official Election Act), and remanded the case to Gwangju High Court with the intent to 'retry.' Accordingly, Governor Kim will be able to maintain his status as Jeju Governor for the time being. The court stated in its ruling, \\\"Evidence collected in violation of search and seizure procedures stipulated by the Constitution and Criminal Procedure Act during the investigation process cannot be used as evidence for conviction, but evidence capability may be recognized when necessary to clarify substantive truth.\\\" Governor Kim was indicted on charges of planning election campaigns by mobilizing civil servants, including receiving reports on candidate lists of regional leaders for local elections and 'current status of special management leaders by region and profession' created based on this from Jeju Provincial Government employee Hyun and two others including a cousin brother in February last year. Until now, Supreme Court precedents have recognized evidence capability without exception for non-testimonial evidence such as documents, even if it was evidence collected through illegal methods.\\n\\n[Hankook Ilbo] Representative Kang Jae-seob: \\\"Baek Il-seob's strange words regrettable\\\" Grand National Party Representative Kang Jae-seob expressed regret on the 15th regarding actor Baek Il-seob's remarks at a party-hosted event on the 14th about former Chairman Lee Hoi-chang's candidacy, saying \\\"Regardless of party to party, even among friends, betrayal is not right to do. (Former Chairman Lee) should not wander the night streets before getting beaten to death.\\\" Representative Kang said at the Supreme Council meeting that day, \\\"A certain actor came out and said strange things, which has nothing to do with our party and was individual impulsive behavior,\\\" and \\\"If former Chairman Lee's feelings were hurt by such remarks, it is wrong for the party. We consider it regrettable.\\\" Regarding this, former Chairman Lee said to reporters' questions that day, \\\"Didn't all kinds of criticism, censure, and abuse pour out against me from the beginning?\\\" and \\\"I don't pay much attention to ordinary abuse.\\\"\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Ministry of Unification official extorts 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD], passes tourism costs to others A Ministry of Unification official who demanded bribes from companies and arranged for an acquaintance's company to provide bribery funds was arrested by prosecutors. The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office Special Investigation Division 3 (Chief Prosecutor Lee Myung-jae) arrested Ministry of Unification official Yoon (42) on the 15th on charges of receiving hundreds of millions of won in bribes from companies in connection with the government's inter-Korean overland transit system improvement project. Yoon, who worked in the Ministry of Unification's inter-Korean economic cooperation team and was in charge of North Korea-related projects, demanded bribes from Company O, a system development and installation company, saying \\\"I will provide administrative support and various conveniences for business promotion\\\" in relation to North Korea project contracts. Company O paid 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] to Yoon in five installments from August last year to April this year by manipulating accounting books to appear as if they paid labor costs even though they did not actually contract with outsourcing companies for personnel supply. Yoon arranged Mt. Kumgang tourism for graduate school professors who reviewed his doctoral dissertation, receiving a 50% discount from the tourism company and forcing Company O to pay the remaining 50%, 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD]. Yoon, who had worked in the information and communication industry, was specially recruited as a technical civil servant to the Ministry of Unification in November 2004 and is known to have worked in the inter-", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8387, "output_tokens": 4096, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Coincidentally, the nine foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province, including Gimpo Foreign Language High School, jointly created general admission exam questions for the first time this year, and there is a high possibility that the pre-leaked exam questions from Gimpo Foreign Language High School overlapped to some extent with the questions from the other eight foreign language high schools, making disputes over exam fairness inevitable. In the worst-case scenario, the test results of all nine foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province would need to be canceled and re-examinations conducted, but fierce backlash from test-takers who have already received acceptance notifications is as predictable as fire, and even if re-examinations are not conducted, considerable backlash from those who failed is expected. If the conclusion leans toward re-examinations, there is a high probability that the admission schedule for regular high schools, which begins application submissions on the 12th, will also be disrupted in some form.\\n\\n◇'Fairness Disputes' Likely for All Foreign Language High School Exams in Gyeonggi Province = The reason this pre-leak of exam questions at Gimpo Foreign Language High School foreshadows 'far-reaching' repercussions is due to the 'joint question creation' method that the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education introduced for the first time this year. The Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education stated, \\\"There has been a lot of controversy, including disputes over encouraging hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry], as foreign language high schools have been creating exam questions individually,\\\" and \\\"To resolve such problems, we jointly created general admission exam questions for all nine foreign language high schools in the province using a question bank method for the first time this year.\\\" According to this policy, a joint question creation committee was formed with 36 school teachers participating—four from each of the nine foreign language high schools in the province—and they created questions in isolation for 10 days starting from the 20th of last month. The joint question creation committee created a 'question pool' that was 2-3 times the number of exam questions for each school in areas such as language (Korean), English (reading comprehension and listening), and creativity/thinking skills (mathematics), and question creators from each foreign language high school selected questions from this 'question pool' according to the distribution standard of '50% self-created + 50% created by other school committee members' to compile school-specific exam questions. Although it has not yet been specifically confirmed how many questions were leaked from Gimpo Foreign Language High School, there is a high possibility that the exam questions leaked from Gimpo Foreign Language High School overlapped considerably with the exam questions of the other eight foreign language high schools precisely because of this reason. Officials from the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education and the joint question creation committee said, \\\"We cannot immediately know to what extent the exam questions of other foreign language high schools and Gimpo Foreign Language High School overlapped,\\\" but \\\"However, since it was joint question creation using a question bank method, we cannot rule out the possibility that some questions overlapped.\\\"\\n\\n◇Should Gyeonggi Province Foreign Language High School Exams Be Retaken? = Gimpo Foreign Language High School, where the question leak was revealed as fact, is reportedly actively considering canceling the results of this entrance exam through consultation with the provincial office of education. For Gimpo Foreign Language High School, where 'pre-leak of exam questions' was confirmed as fact through police investigation, this can be seen as an unavoidable choice. However, the real problem lies with the other eight foreign language high schools. Although the possibility is not high, if it is revealed that the exam questions of other foreign language high schools do not overlap at all with the leaked exam questions from Gimpo Foreign Language High School, it appears the worst-case scenario of all foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province having to retake exams could be avoided. However, if even some questions are confirmed to have overlapped, regardless of how much they affected the test results, they will inevitably be embroiled in tremendous 'fairness disputes.' As distrust in the exam itself intensifies, if those who failed protest all at once, it will likely be difficult to calm the situation with explanations like 'it had no significant impact on pass/fail results.' Ultimately, if even some of the questions leaked from Gimpo Foreign Language High School were included in the exam questions of the other eight foreign language high schools, the situation will likely lean toward complete re-examinations. Officials from other foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province are showing a reserved stance for now, saying, \\\"We do not know the exact situation currently unfolding\\\" and \\\"We will decide the direction of handling through consultation with the provincial office of education.\\\" Lee Sang-deok, Director of Education at the Provincial Office of Education, stated, \\\"While holding a countermeasure meeting regarding the Gimpo Foreign Language High School issue, we will also need to discuss the direction of handling the test results of the other eight foreign language high schools.\\\" A total of 13,370 students applied for general admission to the nine foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province this year, and 1,560 were accepted, with each foreign language high school already announcing the list of successful candidates on the 3rd.\\n\\n◇What Happens to Regular High School Admissions? = If the situation develops toward the nine foreign language high schools in Gyeonggi Province canceling their admission results and conducting re-examinations, it is feared that this will have a significant impact on the regular high school admission schedule, which involves application submissions from the 12th-20th followed by exams on the 11th of next month. Lee Sang-deok, Director of Education at the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education, stated, \\\"Even in the worst case where all foreign language high school exams in the province are retaken, the new student selection exam schedule for regular high schools planned for the 11th of next month will not change,\\\" and \\\"Regular high school exams are conducted simultaneously nationwide, making schedule changes themselves impossible.\\\" However, there is a strong prediction that just the fact that Gimpo Foreign Language High School's exam questions were pre-leaked will cause considerable confusion in the admission process for regular high schools in Gyeonggi Province. The key issue is how quickly the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education decides the direction for handling this Gimpo Foreign Language High School exam paper leak incident. If they fail to promptly provide a solution to this incident with just over a month remaining before regular high school admissions, it appears that the entire high school admission process in Gyeonggi Province this year will become tangled, resulting in tremendous side effects.

For citizens, the most pressing issues are how much their children's tuition will increase and how much housing costs. According to a survey conducted from November 21st for two days targeting 1,000 adult men and women nationwide on what the most urgent livelihood issues the president should address are: 4th place - reducing the burden of education costs (12.4%), 3rd place - real estate stability including housing prices (12.6%), 2nd place - price stability including oil prices (24.9%), 1st place - job creation and unemployment resolution (33.6%). The president seems to have set next year's economic growth forecast at 4-5%, and the Korea Economic Research Institute has set it at 5.5%. Economic indicators are improving, but ordinary people don't feel it. When might the economic sentiment improve for ordinary people? ▲This is exactly what I'm thinking a lot about. Currently, economic growth is recovering fastest among OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries and will be the highest next year as well, so the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and OECD say it will be 4.5%. I expect it will be slightly revised upward by year-end. I think next year's economy will be around 5%. However, on one hand, looking at various indicators, they say we should use exit strategies, but I don't agree. Even though our economy has good numbers and is leading among OECD countries, there are various variables in the global economy. Problems have arisen in Dubai, and if a financial crisis occurs in any developed country, the ripple effects will come immediately. If the global economy declines, we won't be able to sell our products either. It's impossible to gauge how much oil and gas prices will rise. They say oil prices will be around $80 next year, but I think they'll rise to $100. External forecasts also expect it to be around 5%. Companies and small businesses feel it first. For ordinary people's sentiment, it will probably take until the first half of next year. In the first half, we'll start the so-called Hope Work project from February and do internships again. Youth unemployment is now slightly over 8%. In the US and Europe, it's nearly 20%. They say we're better than developed countries, but the government's immediate task is how to create jobs. If the economic growth rate improves, corporate investment will begin, and domestic demand is recovering a bit faster than the government predicted, so it will probably improve somewhat, but the government is trying to take the lead in creating good jobs among livelihood measures and job creation. Because small and medium enterprises can't find 200,000 people. How to match people who want jobs with those who want to hire - when they don't match well, we have specific plans for the government to provide retraining and customized training to match them. Since we've become a country that provides aid, if we transfer our experience overseas, 20,000 young people will go abroad annually. We're concentrating support on small and medium enterprises and startups. Because there are government efforts to create opportunities for young people, they'll be able to feel it in the second half. [Image enlargement] --You said next year's economy will smoothly reach about 5%, and that we recovered quickly without major damage compared to the global financial crisis, but there are many questions about whether the fundamentals of our economy are recovering. I understand there are many concerns about side effects if we provide short-term stimulus without fundamental improvement being supported - what perspective do you have? ▲In fact, in the first half and third quarter, there was heavy dependence on government fiscal spending. To continue growing, private corporate investment must now follow. That's how demand is created. We were very worried entering the fourth quarter. We thought it would go into negative growth, but fortunately it was positive growth. Looking at the content, private sector began investing much better than we worried about in the third quarter, and private consumption is also increasing a bit. Because household savings are very weak, there are problems with savings. Can companies continue to activate investment in the fourth quarter? Companies must have something worth investing in - they don't do it just because the government tells them to. Listening to economic organizations, companies were passive about investment in the second quarter, but by the end of the fourth quarter they're doing it actively. We're continuously monitoring fundamentals, private investment, consumption, savings, etc. Foreign countries evaluate that Korea is doing things soundly. By 2014-2015, fiscal deficits will also reverse and become surpluses. The government is monitoring very carefully and hasn't disbanded the emergency economic countermeasures committee yet. The perspective is that exit measures should be taken a bit more slowly. [Image enlargement] --What you did well was hosting the G20 summit, and what you didn't do well was tax cuts for the rich. ▲Since becoming president, I'm misunderstood as being pro-big business and pro-rich, but fundamentally I'm instinctively not that way. Big companies must do well to create jobs. You could say I'm pro-market, but I'm pro-jobs. Tax cuts are about creating jobs. 65% of tax cut benefits go to small and medium enterprises. To call this policy for the rich is a misunderstanding. It's frustrating, but I have firm convictions. (Tax cuts) create jobs and stimulate domestic demand, I believe. --When talking about pro-ordinary people policies, you gave the example of the Smile Foundation, but there are concerns about moral hazard if people just take money without doing business and don't repay. ▲This is part of ordinary people's policy, but the people suffering most are those doing business in traditional markets and on the streets - these people can't engage in financial transactions. It applies to people doing small and medium business, but benefits don't properly reach people doing street business. When urgent, they end up using private loans of 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] or 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD], and it grows to 10 times the principal. The foreign term for this is microcredit. We liked the name 'Smile' so we called it Smile, where large corporations and financial institutions voluntarily put forward 1.3 trillion won [approximately $1 billion USD] and companies do it themselves. Each company puts forward a certain amount, giving these people from 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD] to 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD], with some places giving up to 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD]. It hasn't been long since we started this, but many people say the purpose is good but ask what about moral hazard. Two weeks ago I went to an event venue where an elderly woman wanted to meet me, but security wouldn't let her, so we brought her over. This woman was making fish-shaped pastries in Jongno but couldn't make them anymore because she didn't have 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD]. She borrowed 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD] to make fish-shaped pastries again and came to thank me. She said she'd used private loans all her life, but this was the first time receiving low-interest financing. She said what she wants to do now is give fish-shaped pastries to poor people who in the past could only look at them without being able to buy them, since she received the country's grace. I was moved. I tell people who talk about moral hazard: People who borrow 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD] or 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD] absolutely won't default. They might repay a bit late though. But there are people who default on 5 billion won [approximately $3.8 million USD] or 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD]. Because I'm confident that people who borrow 3 million won [approximately $2,300 USD] or 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD] do repay, this system should be expanded in the future. From companies and financial institutions that participated, about 700-800 billion won [approximately $530-600 million USD] remains, so we'll probably create nearly 2 trillion won [approximately $1.5 billion USD] in Smile Finance for loans.

[Image enlargement] --(Citizen) I'm approaching graduation and trying hard to find employment, but it's difficult. You mentioned venture startups to resolve youth unemployment, but startups realistically have few success cases and are difficult. They don't meet the income and welfare levels we hope for, so rather than just telling us to lower our expectations, wouldn't it be right to present fundamental solutions? ▲Many people say to lower your expectations, but I don't use such words. When I was young and heard that, I felt bad. Don't lower them, match them. If you go to big companies, there are often cases where you repeat the same predetermined tasks. Small and medium enterprises might be disappointing, but the scope is wide so there are many things to experience. They hire new employees but these days they hire all experienced workers. In such times, you can gain experience at small and medium enterprises and go to other companies. Looking at people doing small and medium business, the salary is decent but young people don't apply, they say. Many young people's majors don't match, so the government provides training for that. There are 6-month and 1-year courses with 600,000-1 million won [approximately $450-750 USD] support for free education systems established nationwide. Ventures literally require challenge. You might fail, but don't fear failure. If you fear failure and do nothing, you can't gain experience. You can gain experience and mature even through failure. I actually joined a small and medium enterprise. That small enterprise later became a large enterprise, but people asked why I was going to such a company. Still, I went to the small enterprise, felt rewarded, and had the experience of growing as the company grew. I'm saying to also look at small and medium enterprises. Aren't service industries good jobs? 40-50 are created while manufacturing creates less than 10. We'll foster service industries so many young people can enter. --I'm a company employee in my 30s. I tried to apply for the Bogeumjari Housing newlywed special sale, but couldn't apply because I don't have children. Friends also give up applying due to strict conditions. You say you're focusing on housing stability for ordinary people, but I wish you'd prepare ordinary people's measures more satisfactorily. ▲I moved 8 times in 3 years after marriage. I was evicted every 6 months. Later I went to a 20-pyeong apartment and had four children. I promised to build rental and sale apartments that can be used long-term for 10, 20 years or more near downtown, close to workplaces, and give priority to people who worked all their lives but couldn't own homes even if they're not newlyweds. When trying to implement policies, suddenly many people said they were getting married and many newlyweds came out, making it unmanageable. I can't investigate whether someone is pregnant. We're taking measures to show consideration to those who say they're pregnant, but Bogeumjari Housing doesn't end at once - it comes out twice a year. The government is reviewing giving the same opportunities to those who are definitely pregnant. But they shouldn't speculate and sell. We don't want speculation since it's so cheap, new green buildings with low management fees, and high-quality buildings. [Image enlargement] --In the past, there were many kidnappings, so parents worried a lot. Now with incidents like the 'Cho Doo-soon case,' those with daughters don't feel at ease. As parents, we worry about preventing repeat offenses and whether we can send our children outside with peace of mind. ▲It's truly bewildering. We talk about becoming a first-class country, becoming a developed country, but becoming developed isn't just about income rising. We must become developed by eliminating things like child sexual crimes and living comfortably. Among all crimes, I think child sexual crimes are the most immoral. Child sexual offenders should be isolated from society for life. In our country, sentences for drug offenders and child sexual offenders are lower than in other developed countries. We should raise these and establish government measures so that everywhere these people move, it can be announced what kind of people they are, so they can't establish footing. We should eliminate such heinous criminals and are reviewing creating 'caretakers' for children going to school, where neighborhood grandmothers take them, and mothers with time take turns caring for others' children and their own children without distinction. --My ideal type is a woman who cooks well. While watching TV, I saw CNN news where First Lady Kim Yoon-ok was introducing our food. Does the First Lady actually cook well, and does the president also cook sometimes? ▲I don't cook well. I haven't had opportunities to cook, but I'm good at making ramen. My wife is probably watching TV now. I should say she cooks well - how would it work if I said she doesn't? My wife makes good dakgangjeong [sweet and sour chicken]. She's interested in cooking, but following the Korean Wave, we want to spread Korean food worldwide as healthy food, so the Korean Wave spreads food culture along with arts and culture. --One of our children is a college student, but went to auxiliary police service so we're relieved, but when they were middle and high school students, we thought our backs would break from hagwon education costs. They say when going to middle school, you're fortunate if you don't go into debt. Every time the president announces hagwon education cost reduction measures, the strange phenomenon of hagwon education costs rising occurs. Are there hagwon education cost reduction measures? ▲Education can be called Korea's chronic disease. For 30 years we've talked about equalized education, but we send kids to hagwon education because university admissions can't be equalized, so there's no choice but to receive hagwon education. We must change the university admission system. Shouldn't it disappear if we say you can enter without receiving hagwon education? Instead of selecting by grades, if someone received hagwon education and got 90 points, and someone who didn't receive hagwon education got 80 points, the system should accept the 80-point person. This evaluates that if this person had received hagwon education, they would have scored not just 90 but higher - they have potential.

The teacher evaluation system, which has been debated for decades, will be implemented in earnest, and the proportion of admissions officer screening in university entrance exams will expand to 10%. School choice rights, which were suppressed under the equalization system, will also increase significantly. We examined the progress of major concerns for students and parents.\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"\\\"Who dares to evaluate a teacher?\\\" In an atmosphere where the Confucian tradition of regarding teachers as equivalent to fathers still remains, it was taboo for fellow teachers, let alone students or parents, to evaluate teachers. Only the principal, as the school's head, evaluated their teachers and gave them performance ratings, and this was the only measure for evaluating teachers.\\n\\nHowever, in a situation where various forms of evaluation—upward, horizontal, and downward—have become common throughout society, the teaching profession alone could not go against the flow of the times. This is because the Teacher Competency Development Evaluation System (teacher evaluation system) will be implemented in earnest starting next year.\\n\\nAn amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the legalization of teacher evaluation has been submitted to the National Assembly, and a six-party council has been formed consisting of the Grand National Party and Democratic Party, the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations [Korea's main teachers' union] and KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization), and parent groups recommended by these two teacher organizations. It is expected that the outline of the evaluation system will emerge soon.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has a policy to apply this to all elementary, middle, and high schools starting March next year, regardless of whether the bill passes.\\n\\n◇ Teacher evaluation is 'the trend'... How will it be implemented? = Specific details such as evaluation subjects, methods, and utilization of evaluation results are all included in the bill. Since each party in the six-party council has different positions, controversy is expected, but since no one is openly opposing the implementation itself, the question is at what point a compromise will be reached.\\n\\nEven if the council reaches an impasse due to failure to find a compromise, teacher evaluation is an irreversible trend. This is because the Ministry of Education views this system as a core task for improving teacher professionalism and strengthening public education, and has firmly decided to fully implement the Teacher Competency Development Evaluation System starting March next year regardless of National Assembly discussions.\\n\\nThe fact that one out of every three elementary, middle, and high schools nationwide has already been designated as a pilot school provides sufficient conditions for full implementation, which is another basis for the teacher evaluation trend theory.\\n\\nThe Ministry's plan centers on further strengthening the current teacher training system by providing incentives such as study sabbaticals for excellent teachers to pursue advanced learning, while teachers with poor evaluation results would enhance their professionalism and improve their educational capabilities through long-term intensive training.\\n\\nSome in the education field voice that teacher evaluation systems should be linked to personnel decisions and compensation to be effective, but considering the potential impact on the teaching profession, it is expected to be used only as training materials for the time being.\\n\\nThe Ministry is currently preparing specific measures for implementing the teacher evaluation system, improving the teacher training system, and enhancing teaching professionalism. Once a draft is ready, it will be finalized and announced after public hearings and discussions, then implemented from the new semester.\\n\\nThe evaluation is expanding throughout the education sector, including not only regular teachers in elementary and secondary schools but also principals and kindergarten teachers. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has decided to evaluate all public and private elementary, middle, and high school principals starting early next year on management performance, academic improvement results, teacher and parent satisfaction, integrity, and qualifications, and to impose serious personnel disadvantages such as exclusion from reappointment if performance is poor.\\n\\nAdditionally, according to the early childhood education advancement plan recently announced by the Ministry of Education, teacher evaluation systems will be gradually implemented for kindergarten teachers starting with public institutions as early as the second half of next year, to be used for providing teacher incentives and individualized training.\\n\\n◇ Will the tangled interests be compromised? = With the six-party council for legalizing teacher evaluation starting full operation, discussions are expected to gain momentum. The six-party council proposed by Democratic Party Representative Lee Jong-geol, chairman of the National Assembly Education, Science and Technology Committee, in October last year, includes ruling and opposition party whips from the education committee, the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations [Korea's main teachers' union], KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization), and parent groups recommended by each of the two teacher unions to gather opinions on the direction of teacher evaluation system legalization.\\n\\nThe council's formation was made possible thanks to dramatic attitude changes by KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) and the Grand National Party. KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) had experienced considerable internal conflict over whether to participate in teacher evaluation system legalization, and the Grand National Party also showed skeptical reactions, questioning whether there was a need for re-discussion given that its members had already proposed bills.\\n\\nWith the Grand National Party's agreement removing the biggest obstacle to forming the council, expectations are growing that some form of teacher evaluation-related law will be born soon. The council also said it would reach conclusions by the end of January next year at the latest through working-level meetings.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is premature to be optimistic about reaching consensus, as each party's interests and claims differ on detailed matters. The Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations [Korea's main teachers' union] maintains that conditions must first be created for teachers to focus on instruction, presenting prerequisites such as early introduction of study sabbatical systems and reduction of teachers' miscellaneous duties.\\n\\nKTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) also expressed support for teacher evaluation in principle while presenting 'improvement of the performance evaluation system by principals' as a prerequisite condition. Parent groups are demanding immediate legalization, guaranteed participation of parents and students in evaluation, linkage to personnel evaluations, and even removal of unfit teachers from classrooms.\\n\\nAdditionally, some in political circles are already causing considerable friction by opposing the Ministry's policy to implement this system regardless of legalization as disregarding National Assembly functions, leading to speculation that the council could collapse in the worst case.\\n\\nAttention is focused on what path the teacher evaluation system—the essence of strengthening public education according to the education sector's long-standing principle that to control hagwon education, public education must be properly established, and the level of public education cannot exceed the level of teachers—will take to be finalized and bring new winds to the education sector.

While individual student motivation and effort are certainly the biggest variables, it is true that school characteristics, regional conditions, degree of hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry], and parents' educational background and economic power work in complex combination.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation conducted a multifaceted analysis of factors affecting CSAT performance based on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] data from the past 5 years (2005-2009 academic years).\\n\\n◇ How large are gaps between schools and regions = According to Professor Kim Seong-sik of Seoul National University of Education, over the past 5 years, the average standard scores by CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subject area showed differences between lowest and highest scores of 85.5 points (46.5-132.0 points) by school and 58.2 points (55.7-113.9 points) by city/county/district for the Korean language area.\\n\\nFor foreign language, the gap was 75.6 points (61.5-137.1 points) between schools and 55.9 points (61.5-117.4 points) between regions, while for mathematics (liberal arts track) it was 79.0 points (69.0-148.0 points) between schools and 48.2 points (75.5-123.7 points) between regions.\\n\\nProfessor Kim analyzed that the school factor accounted for 25.2% (mathematics) to 32.1% (foreign language) of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] performance variance, with more than half of this being due to the regional conditions where the school is located. Therefore, Professor Kim argued that interpreting all school gaps as differences in educational effectiveness of the schools themselves would be quite dangerous.\\n\\nTowns and rural areas scored 9.406 points lower in Korean language, 9.653 points lower in foreign language, and 7.709 points lower in mathematics (liberal arts track) compared to cities. This means that even with the same financial independence rate, low-income population ratio, and number of hagwons, there is still about a 9-point gap in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores between cities and towns/rural areas.\\n\\nAdditionally, for every 1 percentage point increase in school dropout rate, Korean language scores decreased by 0.068 points, foreign language by 0.125 points, and mathematics (liberal arts track) by 0.137 points.\\n\\nProfessor Kim Jin-young of Konkuk University also revealed that the influence of inter-school gaps on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] performance was 39.0% for Korean language, 36.5% for foreign language, 33.2% for mathematics (science track), and 26.6% for mathematics (liberal arts track).\\n\\nProfessor Park Hyun-jung of Seoul National University defined inter-school gaps as accounting for 20.07% (mathematics liberal arts track) to 27.82% (foreign language) of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] performance for general high schools. For foreign language, while last year's average standard score was 97.36 points, school averages were distributed widely from 63.69 points to 130.18 points.\\n\\nDr. Kim Yang-bun of the Korean Educational Development Institute calculated that \\\"urban general high school students maintain standard scores about 10 points higher than towns/rural areas across all subject areas and have 5-7 percentage points more students in grades 1-2. If we classify grades 1-2 as the range for admission to 4-year universities in Seoul, about 11 out of 100 urban students are included, while only 4 from towns/rural areas are included.\\\"\\n\\nHe interpreted that 25.7% of general high school Korean language scores were due to inter-school differences.\\n\\n◇ Is attending specialized high schools advantageous = Professor Kim Seong-sik of Seoul National University of Education explained that over the 5-year average, specialized high school students scored 19.865 points higher in Korean language, 24.134 points higher in foreign language, and 27.421 points higher in mathematics (liberal arts track) than general high school students.\\n\\nIn terms of 5-year trends, he said specialized high schools improved by 0.857 and 0.984 points more than general high schools each year in Korean language and mathematics respectively.\\n\\nDr. Kim Yang-bun announced that standard scores for science high schools, foreign language high schools, and autonomous private high schools were confirmed to be 13-30 points higher than general high schools. Particularly, foreign language high schools showed a pattern of consistently maintaining high score ranges across all subject areas, while science high schools showed a declining trend and autonomous private high schools showed an upward trend followed by maintenance.\\n\\nFor science high schools, while they showed higher average scores than other high schools across all subject areas in the 2005 academic year, they continuously declined and by 2009 fell below foreign language high schools and autonomous private high schools. Conversely, autonomous private high schools showed relatively lower scores compared to science high schools and foreign language high schools in 2005, but rose from 2006 and have maintained stability at a level similar to foreign language high schools.\\n\\nThe ratio of grades 1-2 for foreign language high schools, science high schools, and autonomous private high schools was 30-60%, reaching 3-6 times that of general high schools. Based on this, Dr. Kim explained that the academic level of the top 20-30% of general high school students appears similar to that of all students at science high schools, foreign language high schools, and autonomous private high schools.\\n\\nHe also added that private schools scored about 1 point higher in Korean language, 0.5 points in mathematics (science track), 1.5 points in mathematics (liberal arts track), and 2 points in foreign language compared to public schools.\\n\\nFor mathematics and foreign language, the gap gradually widened, with private schools being about 2 percentage points higher than public schools in the ratio of grades 1-3 in 2005, but this expanded to 4-5 percentage points by 2009.\\n\\nBy gender, for Korean language, female students had a higher probability of achieving grade 6 or above than male students, but there was no difference in the probability of achieving grade 2-3 or above. Male school students had a somewhat higher probability of achieving grade 2 or above in Korean language compared to coeducational schools, but there was little difference for lower grades. For mathematics, there was no gender effect, but female school students had a somewhat higher probability of achieving grade 2 or above compared to coeducational schools.\\n\\nUsing an academic inequality index (average of top 10% students divided by average of bottom 10% students), Professor Kim Jin-young analyzed that coeducational schools, small schools, and schools in towns/rural areas had both low performance and high inequality.\\n\\n◇ Effects of equalization vs. non-equalization = Professor Kang Sang-jin of Yonsei University, based on a 2006 Korean Educational Development Institute survey and 2007 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] data, revealed that for Korean language, the probability of being in grade 1 in equalized regions was 1.34 times that of non-equalized regions, 1.43 times for grade 2, 1.25 times for grade 3, and 1.40 times for grade 4.\\n\\nHe also emphasized that for mathematics and foreign language, there were no ratio differences between equalized and non-equalized regions across all grade levels. Therefore, Professor Kang explained that there is no evidence that equalization policies are unsuitable for excellence education or cause downward equalization of academic achievement, so criticism of equalization is merely assertion.\\n\\nProfessor Kim Jin-young also revealed that analysis of 2009 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] performance showed that equalization vs. non-equalization status, number of high schools in the region, and per capita property tax did not significantly affect performance.\\n\\nHowever, regions with higher ratios of college graduates had higher academic achievement, with a 1 percentage point increase in that ratio raising the region's average standard score by 0.14 (mathematics liberal arts track) to 0.28 (foreign language) points.\\n\\nProfessor Seong Tae-je of Ewha Womans University also analyzed that based on 2006-2008 National Assessment of Educational Achievement results, first-year high school students' mathematics achievement was higher in equalized regions than non-equalized regions.\\n\\n◇ Effects of hagwon education = Professor Kang Sang-jin argued that the effect of Korean language hagwon education actually showed a negative correlation in higher grade levels, with second-year students with higher Korean language hagwon education expenses having lower probability of being included in upper grades on the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam].\\n\\nProfessor Kim Seong-sik of Seoul National University of Education explained that regions with more hagwons had CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores 3.2 (mathematics liberal arts track) to 4.0 points (Korean language) higher, but regions with higher hagwon tuition fees actually had lower scores.\\n\\nParticularly, while areas with many hagwons tended to have higher CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores, their influence on improvement rates was '0', emphasizing that this was merely due to high hagwon demand from top students, not that such conditions actually raised students' performance.\\n\\nProfessor Kim also revealed that the scale of Korean language private tutoring expenses and probability of being included in upper CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] grades had a significantly 'inverse correlation' and produced negative results even in middle-lower grades.\\n\\nConversely, for mathematics, hagwon education showed significant effects, with higher private tutoring expenses increasing the probability of being included in middle-upper levels. However, hagwon education had little effect for lower-level mathematics students, and foreign language hagwon education effects showed no meaningful correlation across all CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] grade levels.\\n\\nProfessor Seong Tae-je of Ewha Womans University emphasized that based on first-year high school mathematics academic achievement results, students receiving hagwon education averaged over 5 points higher, with those receiving 3 or more hours showing the highest scores.\\n\\nDr. Kim Yang-bun also analyzed that in the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] mathematics area, students who received private tutoring scored 5.30 points higher than those who did not. He particularly explained that while private tutoring status did not affect the probability of achieving grade 2 or above, it had significant influence on the probability of achieving grade 3 or above or grade 6 or above.\\n\\nDr. Chae Chang-gyun of the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training introduced that third-year high school students taking EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] prep courses had monthly hagwon education expenses of 147,000 won [approximately $110 USD], only two-thirds the level of non-participants (218,000 won [approximately $165 USD]).\\n\\nParticularly for Korean language, one year of viewing raised grades by 0.16 levels, meaning three years of viewing would have the effect of raising grades by 0.5 levels.\\n\\n◇ Influence of teachers, parents, and peers = Students' internal motivation (aspiration level) and class concentration commonly showed positive effects on academic achievement.\\n\\nDr. Kim Yang-bun analyzed that when a student's enthusiasm level for education increases by one level, Korean language scores increase by an average of 2.612 points.\\n\\nDr. Lim Hyun-jung of the Korean Educational Development Institute found that students taught by teachers emphasizing self-directed learning had 1.3 times higher probability of reaching basic academic proficiency.\\n\\nProfessor Kang Chang-hee of Chung-Ang University, based on 1995 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] raw data, produced results showing that peer group characteristics within a class significantly influence individual students' academic performance.\\n\\nParticularly, the negative influence of lower-performing peers overwhelms the positive influence of higher-performing peers, so lower-performing students are likely to see their grades actually decline when placed in equalized classes rather than non-equalized advanced classes, while higher-performing students are likely to see their grades improve when placed in non-equalized advanced classes because they can escape the negative influence of lower-performing peers.\\n\\nUltimately, Professor Kang argued that the debate over equalization vs. non-equalization is a matter of which to value when systems are reorganized: the grade decline of lower-performing students or the grade improvement of higher-performing students.\\n\\nProfessor Kang Sang-jin analyzed that while parents' educational background contributed to increasing the probability of being included in high grade levels across all areas including Korean language, mathematics, and foreign language, average monthly household income was unrelated to student achievement.\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News)\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5865, "output_tokens": 3287, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Due to this year's CSAT being extremely difficult, with scores dropping significantly compared to mock exams, teachers are experiencing difficulties in college guidance counseling.\\n\\nAt around 9 AM that day, about 30 students in a senior class at Gangseo High School in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, submitted papers with their preliminary scoring results to their homeroom teacher. Teacher Hwang Byeong-won, who is in charge of a third-year science track class, said, \\\"It seems somewhat more difficult compared to the September mock exam.

This was higher than the expected level of around 70%.\\n\\nTest committee chairman Ahn Tae-in emphasized that \\\"even if it meant losing some discriminatory power, we made efforts to ensure the EBS material linkage rate was definitely maintained.\\\"\\n\\nNevertheless, in difficulty analyses of the 1st-3rd periods by school teachers and the hagwon industry, there were almost no analyses saying this year's CSAT was easy.

Therefore, the main concern was how to secure discriminatory power among top-tier students.\\n\\nHowever, in reality, quite a few problems with substantial discriminatory power appeared even among EBS-linked questions, and these are expected to serve as criteria for determining high scores.\\n\\nChairman Ahn said, \\\"Among problems linked to EBS, there are those developed with high discriminatory power.\\\"\\n\\nWhen test-takers take exams, the sense of familiarity they feel while recalling memories of what they saw in EBS materials generally appears high among top-tier students and drops among middle and lower-tier students.\\n\\nHowever, this time the general analysis is that the perceived difficulty did not unconditionally decrease even for top-tier students. This means there were high-difficulty questions that significantly troubled even students who studied EBS materials thoroughly.\\n\\nThe analysis team of school teachers from the Korean Council for University Education pointed out that there were problems that could not be solved just by remembering 'this problem is solved this way.'

According to admissions consulting firms' analysis of preliminary scoring results, all subjects—Korean language, mathematics, and foreign language—showed clear grade declines. For the math section taken by science track students, the first-grade cutline dropped by as much as 10 points. Therefore, both test-takers and school teachers prefer applying to lower-tier schools as a safe strategy.

But Why Do Korean Parents Still Turn to Hagwon Education?\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"U.S. President Obama has once again highly praised Korea's educational enthusiasm. This is already the umpteenth time he has mentioned and praised Korean education. This happened at an event in New York with former President Bill Clinton, where he urged the necessity of passing a job creation bill while mentioning Korea's educational enthusiasm to emphasize the need for increasing the number of teachers. He also reportedly shared details of his conversation during lunch with President Lee Myung-bak.\\n\\n\\\"President Lee told me that their children have to learn English from first grade in elementary school, so they had to bring in teachers from other countries, and they had to pay them to satisfy parents' educational desires. But here (in the U.S.), aren't we laying off teachers en masse?\\\"\\n\\nHe's right. Our country's educational enthusiasm is truly high, isn't it? Conversely, it also means that President Obama is quite dissatisfied with American education.\\n\\nLast year, Obama argued for public education reform multiple times, supporting the educational reform direction of Korean-American Michelle Rhee, who was then the Washington D.C. education superintendent. As you know, Michelle Rhee was a figure who drew tremendous backlash from the education community by strengthening competition between schools and teachers for public education reform, while simultaneously introducing the so-called 'dismissal system.' (She appeared on the cover of Time magazine several times.)\\n\\nAnyway, while white Americans welcomed her educational reforms, colored Americans opposed them, and articles about her educational reforms appeared daily. Ultimately, one of the reasons Mayor Fenty was defeated by candidate Grey (the current mayor) in last year's mayoral election was analyzed to be because colored voters and teachers who opposed Superintendent Michelle's educational reforms cast opposition votes.\\n\\nLast year, an interesting article appeared in the Washington Examiner. The headline was 'Obama disdains D.C.'s School' with the subtitle 'Obama: DCPS not good enough for his daughter.' A direct translation would be \\\"President Obama despises Washington public schools - not sufficient for his daughters.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, President Obama appeared on a broadcast saying that Washington D.C.'s public education had improved greatly, telling parents not to worry and to entrust their children to public education. However, in reality, his two daughters Malia (then 12 years old) and Sasha (then 9 years old) were attending a private school in D.C. with annual tuition of $31,000 [approximately $31,000 USD], nearly 40 million won [approximately $30,000 USD]. When the broadcast host asked, \\\"Mr. President, don't you intend to send your two daughters to Washington D.C. public schools?\\\" he hesitated briefly and answered \\\"No\\\" - this article mocked that response.\\n\\nThe 'Sidwell Friends' elementary school that his two daughters attended at the time was a prestigious private school with only about 10 students per class, where the children of Clinton, Nixon, and Theodore Roosevelt had attended.\\n\\nAnyway, in light of this, President Obama seems to feel that America's education system needs improvement to the extent that it should learn from Korea. Of course, this statement may also have been made with the political intention of quickly processing the 'job creation bill' that Republicans are blocking, saying they must reduce fiscal spending. However, given that this isn't the first time - he has already mentioned Korean education several times - his thinking seems firm that America's education system should be changed by taking Korea's case as a mirror.\\n\\nBut isn't it strange? Why is Korean education, which Obama highly praises, not recognized by Korean people and even shunned? Is it difficult to send children to university without spending hundreds of thousands to millions of won [approximately $150-750 USD to $750-7,500 USD] per month on hagwon education?\\n\\nAnd why don't Nobel Prize winners emerge from Korea, which Obama praises for its educational enthusiasm and education system? Excluding the Nobel Peace Prize, that is. Why do Korean parents spend tens of thousands of dollars per year sending their children to study in America, and why do they even accept early study abroad and geese families [families separated by children studying abroad] when that's not enough?\\n\\nDuring my training period, I organized the differences between American education and Korea's education system on my personal blog, pointing out that we should learn from American education that strengthens creativity education and self-directed learning. I also mentioned that it has admirable advantages in holistic education and educational equality.\\n\\nI have no intention of disparaging Korea's education system. However, I am quite skeptical about whether our country's public education can truly become the model that Obama envisions. This includes parents' overheated educational enthusiasm that prejudges children's futures.\\n\\n\\\"Grandfather's wealth, mother's information network, and father's indifference\\\" being the three elements of children's education is no longer a joke but reality. Seeing test-takers who commit suicide while worrying about entrance exams, and our university students who can only work part-time jobs because they can't pay university tuition, I wonder if Obama knows about this other side of Korean education.\\n\\nWhenever educational problems are raised, I always feel frustrated because I too am a parent, and I think you all feel much the same way. When will we truly achieve real public education that produces excellent talent and allows parents to entrust everything to schools and live comfortably? I hope such a day comes soon.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4067, "output_tokens": 1260, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

A male student in summer military uniform is in a push-up position. Below him, a female student also in military uniform is lying down with a towel covering her eyes as if embarrassed. The subjects of this photo, which evokes inappropriate imagery, are freshmen at Nanjing Normal University. Military training for students was in full swing at the scene. Some say it was punishment ordered by the instructor supervising the military training, while others claim it was a training method that had been practiced for a long time to maximize the physical training effects for male students. When the problematic photo spread across the internet through Weibo, university authorities belatedly tried to manage the situation, claiming that the instructor had not forced it and apologizing to the female student and her parents for their failure to properly supervise. However, criticism continues, with people saying \\\"What kind of sexual assault training is this military training?\\\" and \\\"Are female college students some kind of comfort women?\\\" demanding that this anachronistic military training that treats female students as sexual objects should be abolished entirely.\\n\\n**Image Enlarge** **Image Enlarge** The first semester holds special meaning for new college students who must be filled with a sense of liberation after passing through the hellish gateway of college entrance exams [university admissions]. However, Chinese university life that begins with military uniforms is somewhat different. Chinese college students who enter university every September around this time must undergo military training called 'junxun (軍訓)' without exception from the start of the semester. There are no exceptions for male students or female students. It's not easy to find the romance of university life in the faces of freshmen who return darkly tanned from military training under the scorching sun.\\n\\nBased on the Military Service Law and National Education Law enacted in 1984, China has been forcing all new university and high school students to undergo mandatory military training for 7-14 days and 2-3 weeks respectively. The number of subjects reaches 20 million. Military training generally consists of actual combat training such as live ammunition shooting and individual tactics, and theoretical classes on military ideology, military science and technology, modern national defense, and first aid. As with any country, military education forcibly conducted on civilians who are not soldiers remains largely formal. In response to criticism that it's an ineffective system, China's defense and education authorities argue for its continuation, emphasizing the positive functions of securing reserve forces, raising defense consciousness, and training individual physical fitness through military training.\\n\\n**Image Enlarge** **Image Enlarge** However, incidents and accidents occur every year during military training, causing arguments for continuation to lose strength. Students of the new generation born after 1995 have considerable antipathy toward military training. As a result, incidents and accidents continue as conflicts arise when students resist instructors' corporal punishment or harsh treatment during military training.\\n\\nOn the 24th of last month, at the playground of Huangcang High School in Longshan County, Hunan Province, freshman first-year students receiving military training got into a fistfight with instructors and teachers, resulting in 42 people suffering injuries large and small. A brawl broke out when male students protested after an instructor, under the influence of alcohol, harassed a female student. Authorities moved to calm the situation by suspending the qualifications of the relevant instructors and giving disciplinary action to teachers, but it was not easy to quell the boiling public opinion. Earlier in Fuxin, Liaoning Province, there was even an incident where a student who couldn't endure harsh training committed suicide.\\n\\nAmid such intense controversy over abolishing mandatory military training, a 'Military Training Perception Survey' conducted by Weibo showed that nearly 90% of netizens cast votes in favor of the military training futility theory. Military training that has continued for 30 years according to the collectivist national defense tradition of the communist revolution period is losing its place as it no longer responds to the flow of the times. Not only is the purpose of military training itself problematic—demanding obedience and requiring conformity to the system—but the backward military culture that treats women as playthings and fails to properly perceive the seriousness of sexual violence is also an urgent task for improvement.\\n\\n**Image Enlarge** **Image Enlarge** China's controversy over abolishing student military training brings to mind the history of our country's 'military drill.' 'Military drill,' a term that today's college students would find unfamiliar, began in 1968 following the incident where North Korean armed infiltrators including Kim Shin-jo attempted to attack the Blue House [the presidential residence], but it disappeared into history at the end of 1988 (based on university student military drill standards) after controversy that it was a remnant of authoritarian military government. It seems time for Chinese authorities to accept the eternal truth that you cannot force people to wear clothes that don't fit the times.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3793, "output_tokens": 1128, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

year's CSAT across all subjects—Korean, mathematics, and English—meaning students who scored consistently well across all areas are expected to be in advantageous positions for regular admissions.\\n\\nAnalysis suggests that the Korean section had a high perceived difficulty due to significantly longer reading passages and other changes in passage composition format, as well as the introduction of new question types such as composite passages combining modern poetry and drama.\\n\\nIn the mathematics section, high-difficulty questions increased compared to previous years, likely creating greater differentiation among top-tier students, while English was analyzed to be at a similar level to last year's difficult CSAT.\\n\\nCurrent school teachers predicted that with Korean, English, and mathematics all becoming more difficult across the board, differentiation among the highest achievers would be secured, leading to no major confusion in regular admissions applications.\\n\\n◇ Korean: More Difficult Than Last Year, Similar to Mock Exams, So Perceived Difficulty May Have Been Manageable\\n\\nThe Korean section, administered in an integrated liberal arts-science format, appears to have been more difficult than last year's CSAT but at a similar level to the June and September mock exams.\\n\\nKim Yong-jin, a school teacher at Dongdae Girls' High School, said, \\\"It's analyzed as slightly more difficult than last year's CSAT and similar in difficulty to the mock exams.\\\"\\n\\nAccordingly, differentiation among top-tier students is evaluated to have been secured to some degree.\\n\\nGiven that Korean was difficult in last year's CSAT, if it had been made even more difficult, the perceived difficulty felt by students in the exam room would likely have been considerable.\\n\\nYoon Ki-young, a school teacher at Chungam High School, said, \\\"Given that the passages became considerably longer, test-takers would relatively have experienced time shortages in solving problems, which would have made it feel difficult.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, there's also an assessment that while passages became longer and the number of questions per passage increased, students had time to adapt in advance since they experienced similar formats in two mock exams, so the perceived difficulty may not have been that high.\\n\\nLee Jong-seo, director of Etoos Education Evaluation Research Institute, said, \\\"Because test-takers prepared according to mock exam trends, the perceived difficulty may have actually been manageable.\\\"\\n\\nIm Seong-ho, CEO of Jongro Academy Sky Education, analyzed, \\\"With liberal arts and science integration starting this year, whether top-tier science students show some strength in non-literary science material questions will be a variable in the first-grade cutline.\\\"\\n\\n◇ Mathematics: \\\"High-Difficulty Questions Increased, Greater Differentiation Among Top Tiers\\\"\\n\\nAnalyses of the mathematics section's difficulty level differ between field teachers and admissions companies.\\n\\nField teachers analyzed that it was at a similar level to last year's CSAT and the two mock exams, and that students who studied diligently would have been able to solve it sufficiently.\\n\\nHowever, admissions companies analyzed that both Type Ga and Type Na were more difficult than last year's CSAT and mock exams.\\n\\nParticularly for Mathematics Type Na, primarily taken by liberal arts students, the assessment is that perceived difficulty for mid-tier students would have increased significantly due to increased new-type questions and difficult questions.\\n\\nNam Yun-gon, director of Megastudy Admissions Strategy Research Institute, said, \\\"Unlike previous years when about 3 high-difficulty problems were included, the remaining 27 questions were also somewhat difficult, so low-to-mid-tier test-takers who usually encountered easy problems would likely have faced significant time shortages in problem-solving.\\\"\\n\\nFor Type Ga, primarily taken by science students, high-difficulty problems that don't show solution methods at first glance increased from the usual 3 to 4 this year.\\n\\nHowever, both teachers and admissions companies agree that differentiation among top-tier test-takers would have increased.\\n\\nJo Man-gi, a school teacher at Pangok High School, said, \\\"With more high-difficulty questions than previous years, differentiation among top tiers will be easier,\\\" adding, \\\"While average performance is similar, students who previously got perfect scores or missed about 1 question will be distinguished based on how many high-difficulty problems they solve.\\\"\\n\\nJongro Academy Sky Education estimates that for liberal arts students, the first-grade cutline for mathematics will be in the mid-80s, much lower than last year's CSAT (95 points), June mock exam (91 points), and September mock exam (92 points), forecasting greatly increased differentiation among the top tiers.\\n\\n◇ English: Teachers Say \\\"Similar to Last Year\\\" vs. Admissions Companies Say \\\"High Perceived Difficulty\\\"\\n\\nEnglish, which was difficult last year contrary to expectations of \\\"easy English,\\\" was generally assessed as being at a similar level to last year's CSAT, but analyses differ regarding perceived difficulty.\\n\\nTeachers analyzed that while 2-3 questions for top-tier differentiation were included, the rest wouldn't have felt difficult in terms of perceived difficulty given the EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media) connection rate.\\n\\nYu Seong-ho, a school teacher at Sungdeok Girls' High School, said, \\\"Overall there was top-tier differentiation,\\\" adding, \\\"It seems difficult because of questions 33 and 34 that weren't connected to EBS, but looking at the whole test, other questions didn't feel difficult.\\\"\\n\\nAdmissions companies view it as similar to last year's CSAT and more difficult than the September mock exam.\\n\\nLee Jong-seo, director of Etoos Education Evaluation Research Institute, said, \\\"It was similar to last year and more difficult than the September mock exam,\\\" analyzing that the cumulative number of people scoring 90 points or higher would be about 8%.\\n\\nIm Seong-ho, CEO of Jongro Academy Sky Education, said, \\\"Understanding the passage content itself was difficult, and from test-takers' perspective, it would have been hard to perceive the EBS connection,\\\" adding, \\\"Students who prepared at the September mock exam level would have faced major setbacks.\\\"\\n\\nJongro Academy Sky Education forecasts that both the perfect score rate (0.48% last year) and first-grade cutline (94 points last year) for English will be lower than last year's CSAT.\\n\\nYoon Ki-young, a school teacher at Chungam High School, said, \\\"This year, both mathematics Type Ga and Na will have greater influence in regular admissions than last year,\\\" adding, \\\"This year, Korean, mathematics, and English were all administered with considerable differentiation, so confusion in top-tier regular admissions applications will likely decrease significantly.\\\"\\n\\nAhn Yeon-geun, a school teacher at Jamsil Girls' High School, also said, \\\"While last year mainly Korean and inquiry subjects had differentiation, this year differentiation was secured across all areas,\\\" adding, \\\"There will be no major confusion in this year's

A silent university entrance exam war has begun, so to speak. The number of students selected through early decision recruitment exceeds 70% of the total enrollment quota. The selection methods also vary by university, totaling around 2,000 different types, making it difficult even for admissions experts to know them all.\\n\\nWhile high school student records are central to early decision recruitment, selection methods are diverse, with universities adding CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores and essay-writing exams depending on the institution. The admissions process is so complex that even freshmen who have been accepted to universities complain that they don't understand the criteria for acceptance or rejection.\\n\\nCompared to the past when university freshmen were selected mainly based on CSAT scores, this approach aims to break away from ranking-based admissions by reflecting students' usual learning attitudes, enthusiasm, and achievements. It has been eight years since moving away from CSAT-centered admissions.\\n\\nFairness and reliability are the lifeblood of university admissions. But ultimately, a scandal has erupted. A controversy over manipulation of student records has spread to high schools nationwide after a case was exposed where a principal and teachers at a high school in Gwangju received money from parents and manipulated student records that are reflected in admissions to favor specific students.\\n\\nThe fairness of student records, which are the basic data for university admissions, has come under suspicion. The Ministry of Education has hurriedly announced it will conduct a comprehensive inspection to see if student records are being written fairly and properly, and whether there has been additional manipulation. They plan to intensively examine high schools with many student record corrections by the end of next month.\\n\\nAs student record manipulation is suspected to be not limited to Gwangju alone, the fairness of student records is being put under scrutiny.\\n\\nAmong student records, particularly the 'detailed abilities and special skills' section and the 'comprehensive opinion' section written by homeroom teachers are major targets. This is because there is much room for subjective intervention. Student record manipulation occurred as schools tried to increase the number of students accepted to prestigious universities. This is because how many students a high school gets accepted to Seoul National University, Yonsei, Korea University, etc., determines the school's reputation.\\n\\nAlthough a specific school was caught and turned into a case, the reality is that parents, students, and teachers are all not free from the temptation of student record manipulation. When schools, teachers, and parents collude, manipulation is not easy to detect. Additionally, hagwon education [in Korean context, this refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry] that provides consulting for this is also joining in. Ultimately, even in university admissions, which should be the most fair, the logic of money is intervening.\\n\\nHowever, it's not possible to immediately return to score-based university admissions that compete down to decimal points like in the past. Universities say they cannot completely trust student records, so they will filter students through various admission elements such as essay-writing exams, CSAT scores, and interviews.\\n\\nUniversity admissions ultimately depend on fairness and trust. In the past, due to fairness controversies, students were ranked in a single line based on CSAT scores. However, as educational inequality issues emerged, various selection methods appeared. With the fairness of student records being put under scrutiny, the success or failure of fair and transparent university admissions is being challenged.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 2932, "output_tokens": 807, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The idea is to study like in university even in high school. It's a system where students can take desired subjects and graduate upon completing a certain number of credits. Even before pilot operations begin, voices of both expectation and concern are emerging. In this segment, we'll connect by phone with Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education Lee Jae-jeong, who is already piloting an educational process similar to the high school credit system in Gyeonggi Province, to discuss related matters. Superintendent Lee Jae-jeong, hello. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Yes, hello. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: It was last June, wasn't it? You already announced that you would gradually implement a grade-less credit system for high schools, at least in Gyeonggi Province. It's also called the cluster curriculum, I understand. You're already implementing it, right? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: That's correct. We formed a task force to research high school credit operation plans starting last April. Through curriculum cluster operations—programs that bundle multiple schools together—and customized courses and free course enrollment systems, we have been expanding students' subject selection rights. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: You're saying that if they want, students can go to other schools to take classes? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Correct. If their school doesn't offer a subject, they can take it together with other schools. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: Although it's been less than a few months, is it going well so far? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: So far, we're also in pilot operations. The most important thing is that in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, we must enable students to demonstrate their individual abilities and aptitudes. To allow students to make career choices centered on themselves, it's good to broaden students' options. So we currently have 201 cluster operation schools, 94 schools with customized courses, and 95 subject-focused schools in operation. The evaluation has been quite positive so far. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: To put it simply, unlike the current system where liberal arts students must take predetermined liberal arts subjects and sit in classrooms with teachers rotating in and out, and science students do the same for science—this is different. Students who think 'this seems to match my aptitude when I consider my career path, so I want to focus on studying this area to graduate from school' would be given that opportunity. That's what you're saying, right? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: That's right. In Bucheon, for example, we've made all general high schools subject-focused schools. Depending on the school, students can choose from science, internationalization, arts, foreign languages, and integrated education. Students can choose and enter schools, studying more in those fields and less in other areas. We started this as one process. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: One of the main reasons I'm connecting with you by phone, Superintendent, is not only because I'm curious about how it's being implemented in Gyeonggi Province, but also because similar high school credit systems will be piloted at 100 schools nationwide starting next year, as announced by the Ministry of Education. But as I'll ask again later, KTU [Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization] is currently opposing this, saying basic concepts haven't even been agreed upon yet, so how can this be introduced? That's why we're even more curious about how it's being implemented in Gyeonggi Province. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: But KTU [Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization]'s claim that concepts aren't established domestically is an inappropriate expression. The whole world is moving in this direction. Places like Finland have already comprehensively reorganized their curriculum structure and are moving forward. Moreover, in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, arguments that we must fundamentally overturn the entire structure of what we call curriculum have been emerging for several years now. Actually, I think we're late. It's very fortunate that the government is doing this now. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: Since we don't know well, I'd like to ask about basic curiosities and concerns step by step. For example, there will be students who want to make computers their life's work and want to take more computer-related subjects. To satisfy the needs of such students, many subjects would need to be offered. The question is whether so many subjects can actually be offered, whether the various preparations needed to offer such subjects will be supported, and whether enough teachers will be recruited accordingly. This is what I'm most curious about. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Since we're conducting pilot operations, based on the results of these pilot operations, we'll gain concrete experience about which fields require more teacher hiring, which fields need more adjustment, and educational methods. As you mentioned, if a student wants to major in computers, according to the Ministry of Education's announcement, there are required subjects that all students must generally select, which accounts for about 60%. The remaining 40% can be selected from fields they prefer. Under current law, if they select their preferred fields, they can study 20% more, but in this case, they'll do about 40%, so they can select a bit more from their preferred fields. I think there won't be much difficulty in practice. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: You're saying it's naturally not 100% free choice of whatever they want. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Yes. And since not all schools can do this, if subjects are offered regionally through cluster systems between schools as I mentioned earlier, students will be able to adequately complete those subjects. Based on our experience so far, we think we need to consider teachers more comprehensively at the regional level, rather than thinking about teachers by individual schools. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: That could work. But another concern is that once students can choose like this, won't there be a prominent tendency to select only subjects advantageous for college entrance exams, regardless of their future careers? How should this concern be addressed? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: That possibility exists, but since universities actually select majors, if students prepare more in their major fields for university, I think it will be effective for university education. And I think university admissions should change according to high school curriculum organization. Until now, high school education has been somewhat oppressed by university admissions, which was actually a wrong trend. I was also at a university, but universities should have been able to select the personnel they need based on the results of high school education. Since there was no such system, they just did things generally and uniformly, making it difficult for universities to choose as well. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: So this high school credit system isn't just about changes in high school education, but also requires concurrent changes in the university admission system. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: I think so. So universities can actually receive data to select appropriate students for each major field. Students will first select fields according to their aptitudes, and this can connect from high school education to university education. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: Yes. But how about the teacher numbers issue now? There's talk that the student-to-teacher ratio is too high—in other words, there's a shortage of teachers. There's already talk of shortages, but if this high school credit system is implemented, more teachers will be needed. You mentioned clusters earlier, where teachers from nearby schools exchange or enable joint learning, but wouldn't more recruitment still be necessary for full implementation? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Our teacher recruitment methods so far have been based on how many teachers to assign per class. Elementary, middle, and high schools were each different. For example, in middle schools in Gyeonggi Province, if there were 10 classes, we generally assigned 17 teachers. We've done it this way, but for high school education going forward, it's not about this approach, but rather about what teachers are needed by subject and field. We should hire appropriate numbers by field. High schools currently hire about 21 teachers for 10 classes. Instead of hiring this way, as you mentioned, it's not about students per teacher, but requires more detailed analysis of how many teachers are needed by each subject. So I don't think it's a big problem. Currently in high schools, there were about 21 teachers for 10 classes, but if we analyze this well during the hiring process and recruit by major fields, I don't think there will be major problems. Second, if future school education moves toward teachers not being experts who teach, but rather coaching teachers who guide students according to their needs— ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: Making them study on their own, right? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Yes. With separate training, I think it's fully possible. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: I understand. Briefly, do you think this high school credit system can also reduce hagwon education costs? ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: I guarantee 100% that there's a way to reduce hagwon education costs. Because if students can study satisfactorily in their major fields in high school and advance to universities with proper school records based on these results, university selection will be much more accurate. Then there's no reason to go to hagwon education to receive advance education. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: I understand. Thank you for your comments today. We'll conclude here. ▶ Lee Jae-jeong, Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education: Yes, thank you. Goodbye. ▷ Kim Seong-jun/Host: We've been speaking with Gyeonggi Superintendent of Education Lee Jae-jeong.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 7229, "output_tokens": 2676, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

For students participating in the free year system, first-year school records will not be reflected in high school admission screening. The Ministry of Education finalized and announced the 'Middle School Free Semester System Expansion and Development Plan' with this content as its core.\\n\\nAccording to this plan, the free semester, which has been operated for one semester at middle schools nationwide since last year, will be implemented at all 3,210 middle schools next year. Schools can choose the timing from either the first or second semester of the first year, or the first semester of the second year.\\n\\nA new free year system will be introduced, expanding the free semester to both semesters of the first year for schools that wish to participate. Next year, it will be implemented at about 1,470 schools, approximately 46% of all middle schools nationwide, with Gwangju, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon regions introducing it at all middle schools.\\n\\n516 schools have decided to operate connecting semesters that maintain the spirit of the free semester even after it ends, strengthening student-centered classes and process-centered evaluation, and operating free semester activities for more than 51 hours.\\n\\nDuring free semester and free year periods, teachers autonomously restructure the curriculum to operate classes centered on student activities. Comprehensive written evaluations are not conducted, and evaluation is carried out in a way that focuses on individual students' growth and development.\\n\\nFree semester activities consist of four areas: topic selection, career exploration, arts and physical education, and club activities. Free semester arranges more than 170 hours of related activities, while free year arranges more than 221 hours.\\n\\nWith the introduction of the free year system, each city and provincial education office plans to give early notice in March next year that subject school records of first-year middle school students participating in the free year will not be reflected in high school admission screening. They are also reviewing plans by city and provincial education office to not reflect first-year subject school records in high school admission screening for students who participate only in the free semester for one semester of the first year.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education plans to complete revision work within this month through the State Council meeting after legislative notice of the amendment to the 'Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act' for the introduction of the free year system.\\n\\nThe education administration information system NEIS will also be improved to allow input of students' growth and development content through free semester activity classes in school life records as sentences for two semesters. For all students who complete the free semester, subject completion status will be entered as 'P' in the achievement level section, while raw scores and subject averages will be left blank.\\n\\nAn average budget of 18 million won [approximately $13,500 USD] per school will be invested for free semester system operation, while schools implementing the free year system will receive support of 28 million won [approximately $21,000 USD].\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education explained that while it plans to expand the free year system centered on schools that wish to participate, it has no plan to implement it uniformly across all schools.\\n\\nSome point out concerns about students' academic decline due to the introduction of the free year system, along with the possibility that hagwon education marketing targeting parents and creating anxiety could flourish.\\n\\nRegarding this, the Ministry of Education stated, 'Looking at the results of the Korean Education Longitudinal Study conducted last year, students who experienced the free semester system showed higher academic achievement and no significant hagwon education spending compared to non-participating students,' and 'We will continuously crack down on anxiety-provoking activities or illegal marketing practices using the free semester or free year system.'\\n\\nDeputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Kim Sang-gon said, 'By substantively operating and expanding the free semester, we will ensure that school education improves in the direction of developing students' core competencies by moving away from competition and entrance exam-centered education.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3156, "output_tokens": 973, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

unchanged from 20 years ago.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee pointed out that \\\"(in the current CSAT) distinguishing subtle differences among similar answer choices to select the correct answer is evaluated as superior ability,\\\" arguing that \\\"developing students' thinking skills through such problems is nonsensical.\\\"\\n\\nShe stated, \\\"While the college entrance system has changed countless times beyond enumeration, fundamentally nothing has changed and the situation has worsened,\\\" adding that \\\"what fundamentally hasn't changed is the exam system, and depending on what abilities exams measure, students' study methods, teachers' teaching methods, and even the hagwon education [Korea's private tutoring industry] market all change.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee argued, \\\"This isn't a matter of making the entire nation fight over which subjects to apply absolute evaluation to,\\\" asserting that \\\"if we want creative education, what we need now is a completely new exam.\\\"\\n\\nShe presented the IB administered by IBO, a Swiss non-profit public education foundation, and IGCSE, which supplements Britain's GCSE secondary education qualification exam, as models for new exams.\\n\\nIB is an exam targeting children of diplomats and expatriates scattered across various countries, while IGCSE is more of a middle and high school certification exam rather than a college entrance exam like the CSAT.\\n\\nBoth exams focus on measuring test-takers' thinking abilities.\\n\\nProblems without correct answers are posed, such as 'Discuss how much you agree with the

qualitative evaluation has begun with early admissions accounting for nearly 80% of university admissions.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding Director Lee's arguments, Shin Seong-ho, director of True Education at KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization), said he \\\"generally agrees\\\" but pointed out that \\\"the need to cultivate creative and convergent talent suitable for the Fourth Industrial Revolution shows that creating 'competitive labor force' is the goal of education.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Shin argued, \\\"Instead of talent cultivation through competition, we should make cooperation both an educational method and goal,\\\" adding that \\\"it's difficult to agree with the claim that the foundation for change has been established, given that the number of students per class still exceeds the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] average and school records [high school transcript grades] that form the basis of early admissions are still calculated primarily through multiple-choice exams.\\\"\\n\\nHe emphasized, \\\"Innovation in instruction and evaluation systems is meaningless without CSAT reform,\\\" while also stressing that \\\"even if the CSAT changes, there are limits to evaluation system innovation if curricula and textbooks aren't reformed.\\\"\\n\\nThe forum also included participation from Choi

First, reporter Lim Tae-woo reports.\\n\\n<Reporter> Last year, this school had the disruption of retaking the first-year second semester English midterm exam.

So today on Joo Young-jin's News Briefing, we worked hard to bring him here and succeeded. Please come in.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Hello.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Viewers, you saw who this is in the video just now, right? Kim Ji-myeong, a senior at Seoul Seondeok High School. He's become a topic of conversation for overcoming leukemia and achieving a perfect score on this year's CSAT. How do you feel, Ji-myeong?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: It feels very surreal, and I actually didn't expect to get a perfect score, but I'm very happy and proud.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And you've done many newspaper interviews and appeared on broadcast programs like this today, so it must feel even more hectic and surreal.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I'm very nervous.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Nervous? Please don't be nervous at all. Today I just want to hear Ji-myeong's story comfortably. While the CSAT perfect score is noteworthy, I think many people are showing great interest and surprise about the fact that you overcame leukemia. You're in very good health now, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes, I received a complete recovery diagnosis in March of my first year of high school, so I'm living healthily now.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: How many years did you fight leukemia?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I think I received treatment for a little over three years, from my first year of middle school to my third year.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: There's a photo on screen now—that's from first grade, right? Middle school? The subtitle is wrong right now. You received complete recovery diagnosis in March of your first year of high school, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Right? The photos showing on screen now are from middle school, the photos currently showing.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes, from middle school.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: With your head shaved like that, and earlier I saw what looked like a photo of you receiving a scholarship at some temple. What place is that in the current screen?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: That's a temple called Jeonggaksa. They have activities where they give support funds for children suffering from blood cancers like leukemia and other pediatric cancers. I received about 3 million won [approximately $2,250 USD] in support funds from there. So my mom and I always thought we should give back more than what we received. The scholarship wasn't from there—I was taking online courses, and that online course site gives corresponding scholarships when you achieve certain goals or grades. So I donated that scholarship back to Jeonggaksa.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You must give back as much as you received, and even more. You made that promise with your mother and kept it.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: She always says that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Your mother?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You must give back as much as you receive. Your mother always said that.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: She often does that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Ji-myeong also agreed with your mother's words and worked hard to keep that promise, and you kept it. That's not easy at all. Keeping such a promise is never easy, but Ji-myeong did it. But for our viewers who might not be familiar, what kind of courses are these online courses?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: It's short for internet lectures.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Short for internet lectures.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Instead of going directly to a hagwon and listening to teachers who are physically present, there are lectures filmed and posted on the internet. You listen to those lectures, so you think of it as having a virtual teacher. That's how you take classes and learn—we call it using online courses.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You got leukemia. Ji-myeong must have had a really hard time—it must have been very painful and difficult. Looking back, can you tell us how difficult those three years were?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: It was simply the most difficult three years of my life, but also through that process, I matured a lot and had many thoughts about various things. When I think about that time.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Many people think leukemia is not an easy disease to overcome. But when you got leukemia and your body was really struggling and painful, did you have confidence during that process that 'I won't lose to this disease'?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: On the first day, I actually didn't know exactly what kind of disease leukemia was. But just from the sound of it, it seemed like a very serious and dangerous disease, so when I was diagnosed with leukemia, my mom and I cried a lot. I also thought 'Am I going to die?' But then the doctors talked to me and gave me faith. Blood cancer is among various cancers where many treatment methods have been developed, and they said my prognosis was relatively good, so I could be completely cured with just chemotherapy without bone marrow transplant. So I believed that and followed through, which is probably why I could be completely cured.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: It must have been difficult to study during middle school. It must have been very difficult.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I often left school early, so I missed a lot of school classes. That's why I took online courses to supplement that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So we can see that Ji-myeong studied a lot through internet lectures. When you had to go from middle school third grade to high school, wasn't there a gap with your peers? You advanced to high school together with them, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: That seems remarkable too. Despite receiving treatment and missing school a lot, you graduated together with your friends.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: My middle school friends helped me a lot. I was very grateful. When I was sick and couldn't do cleaning duties, my homeroom teacher in first grade asked if the kids could excuse me, and all the kids agreed and were very considerate of me.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Your friends were very considerate. Do you still meet and contact those middle school friends?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I haven't met them yet, but there are friends I still contact.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: There are friends you contact. With such grateful friends, you got through middle school third grade well and entered high school. It's not just any high school—I saw in the article that it's an autonomous private high school?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: To get into an autonomous private high school, you must have studied very well in middle school too, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I did well.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Ji-myeong studied well even while fighting leukemia. But when you came to high school and received the complete recovery diagnosis, how did you feel then?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Actually, this leukemia treatment lasts three years. The first year is the hardest, and the difficulty gradually decreases because the medication dosage decreases. So during my middle school three years, I think I lived almost like someone who was completely cured. So when I received the complete recovery diagnosis in March of my first year of high school, I thought 'Finally, I don't have to get chemotherapy at the hospital anymore, this is the end.' It felt refreshing and like I had shaken off everything.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Didn't you hold hands with your mother and cry from joy when you heard the complete recovery news?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I don't remember if my mother cried or not, but I had been living healthily before that, so I didn't cry that much.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Are you basically a bit optimistic, Ji-myeong? Do you tend to be optimistic about the world?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Everyone says so.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: I was surprised by what you said earlier—that even while fighting leukemia, you said 'I lived like a healthy person.' I think Ji-myeong's natural disposition helped you focus on studying. Actually, viewers, we can call Kim Ji-myeong a CSAT perfect scorer and a student who overcame leukemia, a protagonist of human triumph, and that wouldn't be excessive. But we don't really know Ji-myeong well. What kind of student and person Ji-myeong is—we heard from people around him. This might be something Ji-myeong hasn't heard yet, so shall we listen together?\\n\\n# VCR\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Did you expect Monk Jeongmok to say that?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I didn't even know he gave an interview.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: But that story really shows what kind of student Ji-myeong is. The monk also said you were the first case of someone keeping that promise. So the monk was surprised too. I heard your dream is to become a doctor. Did you start thinking 'I should become a doctor when I grow up' while fighting that illness?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I did think that at the time.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And do you still hold onto that dream?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Since I only studied in high school, I haven't seriously considered my career path much. But I need to write application essays, and everyone around me recommends medical school, and I have that experience, so I want to treat people. So I am considering a medical career path.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: A medical career path. Even among doctors, there are various fields. Have you thought about what kind of doctor you want to become?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: The leukemia I was treated for is handled by the hematology-oncology department. So I was in that ward and went to the hospital, and I saw many people suffering from the same type of disease as me, and since I was also sick, I think I'll probably choose hematology-oncology as my career path.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: How did you study?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I used online courses and school classes. I'd listen to classes first, then during self-study time, I'd review again or preview online courses.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You didn't listen to internet lectures at school, but at home?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So what time did you usually come home?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: School ends at 10:30, so including travel time, I'd get home around 11:10.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So after listening to internet lectures, what time did you go to bed?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Between 12 and 1 o'clock.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Between 12 and 1 o'clock.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: That was in senior year. In sophomore year, in freshman and sophomore years, I went to sleep right after coming home.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: What time did you wake up in the morning?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Around 6:20.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Around 6:20. So your daily sleep time was about 6 hours, 5 hours.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Sometimes 6 to 7 hours.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Did you never take naps during the day?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I slept during break times or lunch time.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: I think your mother is the protagonist who made today's Ji-myeong, from what I saw in the articles. Do you think your mother is the most grateful person in the world to you too?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes. She suffered the most because of me, and when I was receiving treatment, she was a great source of strength beside me. Throughout middle and high school, my mother searched for and remembered information about advancement and college admissions more diligently than I did, organizing everything. Also, in my senior year of high school, my mom told me that I was the greatest gift in her life, which really moved me.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: To Ji-myeong. Your mother said 'Our Ji-myeong is the greatest gift to mom.' I heard your mother doesn't just take care of the household and Ji-myeong, but also has her own business.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: She runs a restaurant?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: Yes, yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Is it a big restaurant?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT perfect scorer: I thought it was big, but my mom says it's not that big a restaurant.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You probably didn't have time to go help your mother because you were studying.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10448, "output_tokens": 4096, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is the second installment in the series, and I had said I would visit an innovation school directly before making my decision. I want to clarify that this isn't a judgment about the rights and wrongs of innovation schools, but rather a personal decision I made based on my reporting. Let me start by sharing my conclusion.\\n\\n\\\"If there's a 'well-operated' innovation school near my residence, I would actively send my child there during elementary school. However, I'm reserved about proceeding to innovation middle and high schools. I would respect my child's opinion when the time comes to decide about enrollment.\\\"\\n\\nHere's why I came to think this way.\\n\\n● A School Where Children Are Happy... \\\"The Woodworking Class Was Memorable\\\"\\n\\nThe innovation school I visited was Sineun Elementary School in Sinjeong 3-dong, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul. It opened as an innovation school in 2011 and is now in its 8th year. When I entered through the main gate with an SBS camera for reporting, I received an incredible barrage of greetings(?) from children who were leaving school. I felt the emotionally bright atmosphere of the school from the entrance.\\n\\nThrough the school's arrangement, I met Jung Se-hee, a 6th grader at this school. The arrangement was made about an hour before visiting the school, and I conducted an impromptu interview with no pre-written questions. I asked various questions for about 20 minutes, almost like conducting an in-depth interview. I persistently questioned her about how school life was, what parts were good, and why she was satisfied, but she never stumbled in her answers. In my over 10 years of interview experience, there are usually moments where people get stuck if there are lies involved.\\n\\nAbove all, I got the impression that she was genuinely enjoying school life without pretense, as she clearly explained what aspects of school life were good and why they were good. Here's part of the interview with Jung Se-hee, reproduced without editing.\\n\\n- How has it been attending school for 6 years so far?\\n= I've been coming here since 1st grade, so I don't know other schools. I didn't transfer here. When I meet kids from other schools and hear their stories, I think 'our school is good.'\\n\\n- Why did you think it was good?\\n= Classes are fun. Right now, woodworking class is most memorable. In 5th grade, we made book stands with woodworking, but it was a bit boring because there wasn't much we could do ourselves. But when I got to 6th grade, we made chairs and I could do about half the work with my own hands, which was great.\\n\\n- Are there classes where you work in teams with friends?\\n= Yes, every grade has them. While other schools have school festivals, we have 'Innovation Festival' where we directly organize projects to introduce what we understood and learned to friends, and we also gave quizzes.\\n\\n- What specifically did you do, on what topics?\\n= This year we learned about 'global villages.' We learned about Japan, China, Russia, and also Europe and North America. Other classes chose North America, but we introduced the traditional clothing of Japan, China, and Russia. Other teams in my class explained a Chinese game called 'Kendama,' and there was also a team that introduced food and the Great Wall of China. In 5th grade, since we were learning Korean history, we did plays, quizzes, and presentations suitable for Korean history.\\n\\n- What role did you play and how was it to actually perform in the play?\\n= I was... what do you call someone under Admiral Yi Sun-sin? Anyway, I played a role with a rather low rank, but when I was given the role, I thought 'can't I make this better?'\\n\\n- Compared to studying history from books, how was it doing it as a play?\\n= Kids all read history through comic books. When I read comic books, it didn't feel real, but when I actually did it as a play, I understood that situation better... Teachers taught us difficult historical words little by little, and when we expressed them through plays, I understood better.\\n\\n- Do you have any burden about studying?\\n= Here they say you need to understand rather than just study... I don't think there's study stress.\\n\\n● Parents' Thoughts Also Resonate... \\\"Everyone Worries About College Entrance Exams the Same, But Child Satisfaction Is Important\\\"\\n\\nI was also able to meet parents who happened to visit the school. They didn't have grand aspirations for sending their children to the innovation school. They simply came looking for an environment where their children could study more joyfully. Of course, they also want to send their children to good universities like everyone else. However, they had conviction that the current entrance exam system isn't necessarily heading in a desirable direction and belief that the innovation school's educational approach would be more helpful to their children in the future.\\n\\nSeo Seung-hee, a Sineun Elementary parent who sends two children to the innovation school, began by saying \\\"First of all, my child is happy. About going to school.\\\" Her older child, who graduated from Sineun Elementary, is already in 9th grade, and as a parent, she finds it most rewarding that the child still enjoys school studies without getting tired of them.\\n\\nWhat did she think about concerns that sending children to innovation schools means they only play?\\n\\nSeo said, \\\"Concerns that academic performance drops and that they don't make children study but only let them play are stories often discussed even within our community,\\\" but added, \\\"I don't worry because we're providing education that teaches methods, not just education for getting good scores.\\\"\\n\\nShe explained that while the approach of children learning through personal experience rather than rote learning might seem to take longer, it has much better learning effects and stays in memory longer. She said that as the college entrance system is gradually pursuing diversity away from CSAT regular admissions, innovation school life won't be disadvantageous as time passes.\\n\\nKim Hye-jin, who moved here specifically to find an innovation school after living in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], focused on 'changes in her child.' Kim said she was positive about being able to find her child's self-esteem through various liberal arts and physical education programs.\\n\\n\\\"My child was very timid and didn't like to step forward. When teachers asked questions, he couldn't answer well. Then one day, he started bringing out what he had inside. Huh? Our child wrote a script? I was shocked. And he also said he made props. He's a child who's terrible at art, but seeing him say he was in charge of props, I was so grateful for the effort to bring out things that neither mom nor he knew about.\\\"\\n\\nParents unanimously agreed that teachers' capabilities played a part in being able to draw out children's potential this way. Sineun Elementary teachers are famous for their passion in directly developing curricula and conducting their own research studies. In fact, the teacher group here has published books systematically documenting the process of how they developed curricula and what effects they had. While there may be various foundations that made Sineun Elementary a prestigious innovation school, everyone agrees that one of them is the teachers' academic enthusiasm.\\n\\n● My 'Courage' Only Goes to Elementary School... \\\"Even Education Office Executives Had No Innovation High School Parents\\\"\\n\\nHowever, despite the strong impression I received at Sineun Elementary, I honestly don't have confidence about whether I could proceed to innovation schools for middle and high school. Am I lacking 'courage'?\\n\\nI think this is because in a situation where the existing entrance exam system including CSAT remains a major pillar, I cannot entrust my child to innovation that departs from regular curricula through middle and high school. Academic advancement is an important crossroads that can determine a child's future. It's not that I don't trust innovation schools themselves, but rather a dilemma that inevitably arises from the incompatibility between innovation schools and the current entrance exam system.\\n\\nA similar dilemma can be glimpsed in a survey of 343 parents with innovation school experience. Looking at the survey included in the commissioned report 'Innovation School Performance Analysis' recently released by the Ministry of Education, 21.5% responded (agree + strongly agree) that they 'worried about high hagwon education costs' before enrollment, which was not insignificant.\\n\\nParticularly for innovation high schools, the percentage of those who acknowledged that pre-enrollment concerns about hagwon education costs 'became reality' after enrollment was higher. Even innovation schools inevitably tend to rely more on hagwon education as entrance exams approach. Regarding this, researchers diagnosed that \\\"this suggests that some innovation school parents are using hagwon education as a supplementary measure in a state where society's overall agreement level on the academic achievement that innovation schools pursue is not high.\\\"\\n\\nPerhaps the reality that there are no innovation high school parents among education office executives also reflects such concerns. The office of Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Kwak Sang-do revealed that among 26 children of grade 4 and above civil servants in Seoul and Gyeonggi education offices since the implementation of the innovation school system, not a single child had enrolled in or was attending an innovation high school. If innovation high schools were really advantageous for the current entrance exam system, transferring would be part of our country's educational fervor no matter how far the commute.\\n\\nWriting about innovation schools has made this article longer than expected. So I plan to add one more installment to the series. While parts 1 and 2 focused on the positive aspects of innovation schools, it's time to talk about the 'shadows' in the next part. Among the people I met while reporting on innovation schools, there were many who spoke about areas for improvement. I'll organize the content I carefully recorded in my reporter's notebook in the next installment.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 6233, "output_tokens": 2355, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Today, once again, I cross not a lake of the heart, but a lake in the restroom. Every break time! Constantly dripping faucets, clogged and overflowing toilets—this was the daily reality of a boys' high school restroom. Students standing on tiptoes to urinate, worried that sewage might splash on their school uniform pants, was accepted as natural. This wasn't a situation where we needed to turn our indoor shoes into wooden clogs, but as my irritation grew day by day, I wrote a brief piece with the above content for the school newspaper. I apologize to the original poet Kim Dong-myeong, but it was just a three-line piece on manuscript paper. The effect was immediate. Along with a teacher's scolding—'You guys are using the restroom like a damn mess, that's why this happens'—the intensity of restroom cleaning more than doubled, and the cleaning frequency became much shorter. Indeed, the power of the pen was tremendous.\\n\\nThough tiring and sometimes bothersome, newspaper club activities were the only joy of my high school life. Despite my parents' concerns—'Does being in the newspaper club help with school records [GPA]? Do newspaper-making skills appear on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]?'—it was something I did just because it was fun, something I truly wanted to do. In reality, the newspaper club provided no help for college entrance exams. I just did it because I liked it!\\n\\nThe newspaper club, which provided no help for college entrance exams—or rather, was almost a hindrance—has apparently become a popular club these days. Junior students unanimously say that regularly publishing articles in the school newspaper and the experience of meeting various interviewees are optimal conditions that can be utilized as material in the college entrance comprehensive school record evaluation. The thought briefly crossed my mind that this was a positive effect of the early admission system and comprehensive school record evaluation, but it quickly disappeared. It left a bitter taste that something I did purely out of enjoyment has now become a means for college entrance exams for my juniors.\\n\\nWe've reached a reality where parents step forward to decide their children's club activities and even pay for consulting to create new clubs. They say this is necessary to easily get into good universities. This is the harmful effect of the comprehensive school record evaluation system. Added to this are expensive ghostwritten personal statements, internal school award records that increase student stress—there are too many things to prepare. Criticism arose that without wealthy parents to take care of everything, good universities are unthinkable. Eventually, the government's new framework was 'simple and fair admissions.'\\n\\n'Simple and fair admissions'—the simplest and most fair admission system might be lining up students by CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores. If it's unreasonable for the direction of college admissions to be determined by a single 'real battle,' then we could create a system that increases the reflection ratio of subject grades for students who studied hard throughout their three years of high school. Simple and fair admissions—pretty easy, right?\\n\\nHowever, this directly leads to side effects like 'exam hell,' multiple-choice test machines, university hierarchization, and grade-based ranking again.\\n\\nThe comprehensive evaluation system won't work because it's a system for the wealthy, CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]-focused regular admissions won't work because it's a revival of ranking—it's inevitable to be confused about what policies are actually possible. Public opinion is also divided in multiple directions. From opinions that CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] should be changed to absolute grading, essentially making it a 'qualification test,' to opinions that CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] functions should be strengthened—even with just CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] alone, as many reform plans as there are CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subjects are possible.\\n\\nNow the task is to fit together the puzzle pieces of this fragmented public opinion to create a big picture. A college admission system reform plan that is simple and fair while not turning students into test machines—it's bound to be an ultra-high difficulty puzzle.\\n\\nThe Presidential National Education Council, responsible for this puzzle, has again created a college admission system reform special committee and a public deliberation committee to proceed with reform work. The college admission system reform special committee will determine the scope of public deliberation through four rounds of regional discussions throughout May, and the public deliberation committee will inherit this to create several specific college admission system reform plans. These multiple reform plans will undergo two months of TV debates, internet opinion collection, and citizen-participatory public deliberation processes to derive a final plan. For the next three months, the entire nation will participate in discussions about college admission system reform.\\n\\nIn fact, although the Ministry of Education said it would discuss college admission system reform for 10 months starting last August, there was no proper opinion collection and discussion process. Naturally, no proper final conclusion could be reached. They just kept watching the reactions of parents, schools, the hagwon education [in Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry] market, and all kinds of public opinion, without reaching a proper conclusion. Now is the last opportunity to derive a college admission system reform plan through real discussion and opinion collection. All members of our society—parents, students, teachers, education officials—must think deeply and present their opinions.\\n\\nEveryone knows it's a big problem, but regarding education policy where proper opinions aren't presented, we must deeply examine and present new directions through this opportunity. What are the advantages of the comprehensive evaluation system, how should its disadvantages be improved, what are the advantages and disadvantages of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], how should we combine CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] and comprehensive evaluation—all opinions must be poured out. There's no need to feel burdened because opinions sharply conflict and conflicts intensify. In decision-making and policy determination, unanimous agreement is rather a symbol of dictatorship. Especially in the case of education policy, there are bound to be even more diverse opinions.\\n\\nKim Young-ran, the very person behind the 'Kim Young-ran Act,' has been appointed as chairperson of the public deliberation committee responsible for this forum of public discourse. Her role is to create a arena for great debate about our education policy and derive conclusions. We look forward to seeing whether she'll utilize her experience in establishing the 'Kim Young-ran Act,' which seemed to have low feasibility before implementation.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4363, "output_tokens": 1564, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This comes 126 days after launching the investigation with extensive searches and seizures on August 27th.\\n\\nWith this, the investigation into corruption allegations against former Minister Cho and his family has been substantially completed.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho faces 11 charges including bribery, violations of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act and Public Service Ethics Act, obstruction of justice through deception, obstruction of business, exercise of forged official documents, exercise of falsely prepared official documents, forgery of private documents, exercise of forged private documents, and instigation of evidence fabrication and concealment.\\n\\nThe indictment spans 58 pages.\\n\\nThe prosecution applied charges of bribery and violation of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act regarding the 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] scholarship that Cho's daughter (28) received at Pusan National University School of Medicine from November 2017 to October of the following year.\\n\\nRoh Hwan-jung (60), director of Busan Medical Center who provided the scholarship to the daughter, was also indicted on charges of bribery and violation of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.\\n\\nThe prosecution concluded that former Minister Cho, as presidential chief of staff for civil affairs at the time, was in a position to exercise influence over the operation of Yangsan Pusan National University Hospital where Director Roh worked, as well as high-level appointments such as Pusan National University Hospital director.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho is also suspected of involvement in his children's college admission fraud alongside Professor Jung [Kyung-sim, his wife]. The charges include: falsely obtaining an internship certificate for his son Cho (23) at Seoul National University's Public Interest & Human Rights Law Center in July 2013 and submitting it to Hanyoung Foreign Language High School; and submitting falsely prepared materials including internship certificates for his son's graduate school admissions to Korea University and Yonsei University in October-November 2017 and Chungbuk National University Law School in October of the following year.\\n\\nThe prosecution found that when the couple's son would miss classes to prepare for overseas university admission, they asked Han In-seop, a professor at Seoul National University Graduate School of Law, to issue a false internship certificate to justify his attendance.\\n\\nThe prosecution determined that former Minister Cho forged his daughter's internship certificate at Seoul National University's Public Interest & Human Rights Law Center.\\n\\nNew evidence also emerged of Secretary Choi's involvement in former Minister Cho's son's admission fraud. The prosecution confirmed that the son falsely obtained internship certificates under lawyer Choi's name twice in 2017-2018, when Choi was affiliated with a law firm, and submitted them for graduate school admissions.\\n\\nBased on physical evidence secured from former Minister Cho's associates, they concluded that Secretary Choi issued the first internship certificate, while former Minister Cho directly forged the second one.\\n\\nSecretary Choi, a former military prosecutor, is former Minister Cho's junior from Seoul National University Law School. He served as chairman of the judicial committee for Lawyers for a Democratic Society and entered the Blue House in September last year, working with former Minister Cho for nearly a year.\\n\\nSecretary Choi is reportedly refusing to comply with the prosecution's summons.\\n\\nIt was also discovered that former Minister Cho took his son's exams at George Washington University in the United States.
