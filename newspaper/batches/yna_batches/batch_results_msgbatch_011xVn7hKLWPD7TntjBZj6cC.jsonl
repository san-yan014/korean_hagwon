Prosecutors determined that the scholarship Cho's daughter received from Pusan National University School of Medicine was a bribe. Circumstances were also uncovered showing that former Minister Cho forged a lawyer internship activity certificate under the name of Choi Kang-wook (51), Blue House Public Service Discipline Secretary.\\n\\nThe Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Anti-Corruption Investigation Division 2 (Chief Prosecutor Go Hyeong-gon) indicted former Minister Cho without detention this morning. This comes 126 days after the investigation began with extensive searches and seizures on August 27. With this, the investigation into corruption charges against former Minister Cho and his family has essentially concluded.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho faces 11 charges including bribery, violations of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act and Public Service Ethics Act, obstruction of justice by deception, obstruction of business, exercise of forged official documents, exercise of falsely prepared official documents, forgery of private documents, exercise of forged private documents, instigation to forge evidence, and instigation to conceal evidence. The indictment spans 58 pages.\\n\\nProsecutors applied bribery and Improper Solicitation and Graft Act violation charges regarding the 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] scholarship that daughter Cho (28) received from Pusan National University School of Medicine from November 2017 to October the following year.\\n\\nRoh Hwan-jung (60), director of Busan Medical Center who gave the scholarship to the daughter, was also brought to trial on charges of offering bribes and violating the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act. Prosecutors determined that former Minister Cho, as Blue House Civil Affairs Senior Secretary at the time, was in a position to exercise influence over the operation of Yangsan Pusan National University Hospital where Director Roh worked, as well as high-level appointments such as Pusan National University Hospital director.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho is also charged with involvement in his children's university admissions fraud along with his wife, Professor Chung Kyung-sim (57, indicted under detention) of Dongyang University.\\n\\nThe charges include falsely obtaining an internship activity prospective certificate from Seoul National University's Public Interest & Human Rights Law Center for son Cho (23) in July 2013 and submitting it to Hanyoung Foreign Language High School, and submitting falsely prepared materials including internship activity certificates for the son's graduate school admissions to Korea University and Yonsei University in October-November 2017 and to Chungbuk National University Law School in October the following year.\\n\\nProsecutors determined that the Cho couple, when their son would miss classes to prepare for overseas university admission, asked Professor Han In-seop of Seoul National University Law School to issue a false internship prospective certificate to get attendance recognized. They found that former Minister Cho forged his daughter's Seoul National University Public Interest & Human Rights Law Center internship certificate.\\n\\nCircumstances also newly emerged showing Secretary Choi's involvement in former Minister Cho's son's admissions fraud.\\n\\nProsecutors confirmed that the son falsely obtained lawyer internship certificates under Secretary Choi's name twice in 2017-2018, when Choi was with law firm Cheongmaek, and submitted them for graduate school admissions. Based on physical evidence secured from around former Minister Cho, they concluded that Secretary Choi issued the first internship certificate, and former Minister Cho directly forged the second one.\\n\\nSecretary Choi, a former military prosecutor, is a junior of former Minister Cho from Seoul National University Law School. He served as chair of the Judicial Committee of Lawyers for a Democratic Society (Minbyun) and entered the Blue House in September last year, working with former Minister Cho for nearly a year. Secretary Choi is reportedly refusing to comply with prosecutors' requests for appearance.\\n\\n[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nIt was also discovered that former Minister Cho took his son's exams at George Washington University in the United States. Prosecutors determined that Minister Cho received online exam questions from his son twice in November-December 2016 and solved them separately, resulting in the son receiving an A grade, and applied obstruction of business charges against George Washington University. The false documents submitted for domestic graduate school admissions also included a George Washington University scholarship certificate.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho is also charged with violating Public Service Ethics Act obligations for blind trust and falsely reporting assets in connection with Professor Chung's nominee stock investments.\\n\\nProsecutors determined that former Minister Cho knew about Professor Chung's nominee stock investments and jointly managed the assets. They allege that after taking office as Civil Affairs Senior Secretary in May 2017, he falsely reported having debts to hide nominee stocks worth approximately 800 million won [approximately $600,000 USD].\\n\\nProsecutors determined that former Minister Cho obstructed the Public Service Ethics Committee's asset review work by submitting falsely prepared loan agreements and other materials as explanatory documents.\\n\\nProsecutors also confirmed circumstances showing that funds for purchasing shares of secondary battery company WFM came from former Minister Cho's account. However, they did not apply bribery charges as they determined the stock purchase was unrelated to former Minister Cho's official duties.\\n\\nThere are also charges that he had Professor Chung forge private fund operation status reports during parliamentary confirmation hearings in August this year and instructed asset manager Kim (37) to replace and conceal the hard disk of the PC at his Bangbae-dong home in Seoul.\\n\\nProsecutors additionally indicted Professor Chung on charges including forging Dongyang University youth humanities program certificates and awards and submitting them to Hanyoung Foreign Language High School.

Whether to include Cho's daughter (28) as a defendant is still under consideration until the last minute.\\n\\n◇ Cho Kuk indictment finalized... weighing timing of prosecution\\n\\nAccording to the legal community on the 29th, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Anti-Corruption Investigation Unit 2 (Chief Prosecutor Ko Hyeong-gon) has virtually completed reviewing the legal theories to apply to Cho and other case-related individuals and drafting the indictment, and is deliberating the timing of prosecution.\\n\\nProsecutors were reportedly originally planning to send Cho to trial on the 27th.\\n\\nHowever, it is known that the schedule was postponed after the court rejected an arrest warrant requested by the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office in connection with allegations of 'covering up inspections' against former Busan Deputy Mayor for Economic Affairs Yoo Jae-su (55, indicted under detention).\\n\\nProsecutors are not expected to indict Cho on the 30th, when Justice Minister nominee Choo Mi-ae's National Assembly confirmation hearing is held. This is because announcing investigation results regarding the immediate former Justice Minister on the day the successor minister nominee's confirmation hearing is conducted could raise unnecessary misunderstandings.\\n\\nIn particular, the 30th is also the day when the National Assembly is expected to hold its first plenary session of the new extraordinary session and vote on the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) bill placed on the fast track.\\n\\nSince announcing investigation results when sensitive legislative issues are at stake could lead the political community to interpret this as a political act, there is a high possibility that prosecutors will exclude the 30th as the prosecution timing.\\n\\nProsecutors have recently announced their policy to indict Cho's family corruption allegations case 'within this year' if possible. Therefore, prosecutors are considering the 31st, the end of the year, as the prosecution timing.\\n\\nHowever, since there is no situation requiring prosecution within the year at all costs, January 2nd of next year is also reportedly being considered as a strong option.\\n\\nThe case involving allegations of college admissions corruption and private equity fund irregularities involving former minister Cho's family, which began with extensive searches and seizures on August 27th, will see all related parties sent to trial within this week after 4 months.\\n\\n[Provided by Yonhap News TV]\\n\\n◇ Cho Kuk's daughter likely to be indicted without detention... brother-in-law and mother likely not to be prosecuted\\n\\nProsecutors have so far indicted 5 people under detention, including Professor Jeong. These include 3 family members - Professor Jeong, Cho's younger brother Jo (52), and his cousin Jo Beom-dong (36) - as well as 2 accomplices who served as money delivery agents in conspiracy with brother Jo regarding Ungdong Academy corruption.\\n\\nProsecutors continue to review whether to also indict the daughter when indicting Cho. The daughter is already specified as an accomplice in admissions corruption charges in Professor Jeong's indictment, which prosecutors additionally filed on the 11th of last month.\\n\\nWithin the prosecution, opinions reportedly include that since the mother has already been indicted under detention and the father will also be sent to trial, the daughter should receive prosecution deferment, as well as opinions to proceed with summary indictment for a fine since the charges are proven.\\n\\nHowever, it is known that they are deliberating until the last minute, as there are also opinions that indictment without detention is inevitable considering that both parents were not detained and the daughter denied all charges and did not cooperate with the investigation.\\n\\nProsecutors are also referencing the case of a former Sungkyunkwan University professor who was indicted under detention on charges including obstruction of business for having students ghostwrite papers for his college student daughter's Seoul National University Graduate School of Dentistry admissions. At that time, the daughter was indicted without detention along with her mother.\\n\\nProsecutors reportedly concluded not to send Cho's son (23) to trial. Cho's mother Park (81, chairperson of Ungdong Academy), who was implicated in Ungdong Academy corruption allegations, is also reportedly not expected to be prosecuted.\\n\\nRegarding private equity fund allegations, prosecutors are expected to indict without detention Professor Jeong's younger brother Jeong, executive managing director of Bonamie System who was an 'accomplice' with Professor Jeong and Jo, as well as Lee Sang-hoon (40), nominal representative of private equity fund management company Colink Private Equity (PE), and Choi (54), CEO of streetlight flasher manufacturer Wells C&T.\\n\\nIn addition, Kim Kyeong-rok, a Korea Investment & Securities private banker (PB) who serves as asset manager for Cho's family and helped with personal PC hard drive replacement, may also be sent to trial.\\n\\n[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n◇ Expected to be indicted for violations of Public Service Ethics Act, etc... interest in whether bribery charges will be applied\\n\\nCho faces allegations related to ▲ involvement in nominee stock investment in his wife's WFM shares ▲ daughter's receipt of Pusan National University Graduate School of Medicine scholarship ▲ false issuance of Seoul National University Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center internship certificate ▲ Ungdong Academy sham litigation and hiring corruption ▲ false preparation of private equity fund operation status reports ▲ evidence destruction of PC at his Bangbae-dong, Seoul residence. He exercised his right to remain silent during three suspect interrogations.\\n\\nProsecutors are expected to include charges such as violations of the Public Service Ethics Act, which were not included in Professor Jeong's indictment, in Cho's indictment.\\n\\nProsecutors are expected to apply charges including violations of the Public Service Ethics Act for concealing Professor Jeong's nominee stock investment details during public official asset reporting, as well as violations of the Financial Real Name Act and criminal instruction for evidence concealment.\\n\\nThe point of interest is whether bribery charges will be applied to Cho. Prosecutors examined whether WFM sold stocks cheaply to Professor Jeong, Cho's wife, in expectation of influence from the Blue House senior secretary for civil affairs, and whether there was a bribery nature to the daughter's medical school scholarship.\\n\\nEven after prosecutors conclude their investigation into 'family corruption' allegations, investigations targeting Cho will continue. The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division 6 (Chief Prosecutor Lee Jeong-seop) is investigating allegations of covering up former Deputy Mayor Yoo's inspection, while the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Public Investigation Unit 2 (Chief Prosecutor Kim Tae-eun) is investigating allegations of 'ordered investigations and election interference.'\\n\\nAfter Cho's indictment, Anti-Corruption Investigation Unit 2 (Chief Prosecutor Ko Hyeong-gon) will switch to a prosecution maintenance system. This is because the importance of trials has grown, with conflicts arising between prosecutors and the court over indictment amendments in Professor Jeong's trial for 'family corruption' allegations.\\n\\nSome are interested in whether Cho's cases will be consolidated. If Cho is indicted related to 'family corruption' allegations, he will be tried at Seoul Central District Court. If he is additionally indicted for 'inspection cover-up' allegations, he will also be tried at Seoul Eastern District Court where former Deputy Mayor Yoo is being tried. Therefore, there are observations that he could be tried in one of the two courts through case consolidation.\\n\\nA lawyer who is a former presiding judge said, \\\"From the defendant's perspective, being tried in one place rather than multiple places is advantageous in terms of guaranteeing defense rights,\\\" but predicted, \\\"Considering the different nature of family corruption and inspection cover-up allegations cases and that former Deputy Mayor Yoo is already being tried, there is a high possibility that the first trial will proceed in two branches and be combined in the second trial.\\\"\\n\\nraphael@yna.co.kr\\nReport via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>2019/12/29 08:00 transmission December 29, 2019 08:00 transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5001, "output_tokens": 2138, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Jae-young = Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon stated in a New Year interview with Yonhap News on the 26th that he would make a conclusion on whether to introduce the 'Sunday rest system for hagwons,' which recently completed public deliberation, after the first half of next year.\\n\\nRegarding 'mock election project classes' that conservative groups worry may have political bias, Superintendent Cho said, \\\"I will ensure that (teachers) do not use it as a means to advocate political opinions or private interests.\\\"\\n\\nThe following is a Q&A with Superintendent Cho.\\n\\n-- What are your thoughts as we welcome the New Year?\\n\\n▲ I have set this year's theme as 'haehyeongyeongjang' [解弦更張], which means restringing a geomungo [traditional Korean zither]. I will tighten loose strings and replace broken ones.\\n\\nIn particular, next year will mark 10 years since the innovative school policy began in Seoul. I will examine the path we intended to take, the path we have actually walked, and the path we will move forward on.\\n\\n-- Please select just three priority projects for the New Year.\\n\\n▲ I want to focus more on the essence of education. First, I will achieve innovation in classes. At the same time, I will thoroughly take care of basic academic skills. Finally, I plan to strengthen ecological transformation education in response to the climate crisis.\\n\\n-- Public deliberation on the Sunday rest system for hagwons, which would force hagwons in the Seoul area to rest on Sundays, recommended introducing the system. When will the decision on whether to introduce the system be made?\\n\\n▲ The Sunday rest system for hagwons is a very sensitive policy where students, parents, hagwon operators, and hagwon instructors are all direct stakeholders. I also know that there are many opinions that it should not be introduced because it has limited effectiveness due to the balloon effect (Seoul hagwons resting would lead to a rush to hagwons in surrounding areas that don't observe the holiday) and because it violates (students') 'autonomous learning rights.'\\n\\nAccordingly, I plan to decide carefully with sufficient time. After comprehensively reviewing the public deliberation results and policy research results coming out around February next year in the first half of next year, I will determine whether to introduce the system through close consultation with the Ministry of Education and the Seoul Metropolitan Council.\\n\\n-- There are criticisms that it is 'hasty' for the education office to conduct mock election classes at 40 elementary, middle, and high schools during next year's general election as part of social issue education.\\n\\n▲ The Public Official Election Act amendment lowering the voting age to 18 has been designated as a 'fast-track' item in the National Assembly. I believe this period before the general election is an appropriate time to provide democratic citizenship education through mock election classes.\\n\\nThe education office will continue to consider teaching methods until February next year when teacher workshops for mock election classes are conducted. I will also carefully examine educational materials provided to schools to ensure they are not biased. Through teacher training, I will ensure that mock elections are not used as a means to advocate specific political opinions or private interests, and I will monitor the class process.\\n\\n-- Progressive education groups are opposing the policy to conduct basic academic skills diagnosis for 3rd grade elementary and 1st grade middle school students starting next year using standardized tools in the form of multiple-choice tests.\\n\\n▲ The basic academic skills diagnostic tools that the education office will use are so easy that 70% of test-takers score 90 points or higher out of 100, so (students who take the test) cannot determine what level other students' academic abilities are at. While there were differences of opinion with education groups regarding the use of standardized tools, mutual consultation has now been achieved.\\n\\n-- You were about to announce a 'joint growth plan for original residents (Korean students) and immigrants (Korean-Chinese students)' in partnership with Guro, Geumcheon, and Yeongdeungpo districts, but the plan has stalled due to strong public opposition to the bilingual education reinforcement policy included in the plan. What are your future implementation plans?\\n\\n▲ I will announce the plan in January next year. I only delayed the announcement because more persuasion process was needed, not because I won't pursue it.\\n\\n-- The site selection for the special school in Jungnang District (Dongjin School) is making little progress. There are concerns that the opening could be postponed to 2023. Please explain the future schedule.\\n\\n▲ Final consultation with Jungnang District Office regarding the site is underway. We were scheduled to begin urban planning decision change services and design this year, but the schedule was somewhat delayed when Jungnang District requested a different location from the one originally selected by the education office. I will proceed with urban planning decision change services and design next year to ensure there are no obstacles to opening in 2023.\\n\\njylee24@yna.co.kr\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>\\n2019/12/26 06:10 sent, December 26, 2019, 06:10 sent\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3660, "output_tokens": 1324, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

I hope many people will recognize that effort can triumph.\\\"\\n\\nSong Yeong-jun (18), a student at Gimhae Foreign Language High School who received a perfect score on the 2020 CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam), expressed his thoughts on achieving a perfect score on the 4th, stating that he firmly believed it would be a 'right world' where focusing solely on school studies without hagwon education could still yield good results.\\n\\nSong had been a 'model student' who maintained top 10 rankings in his class through middle school.\\n\\nLiving with his single mother who worked hard at a restaurant, his family's modest circumstances meant he achieved these results through personal effort alone, without even once attending the common hagwons or receiving private tutoring.\\n\\nSong, who entered Gimhae Foreign Language High School through a special admission program for socially disadvantaged students, felt great frustration during the class placement exam.\\n\\nRanked 126th out of 127 total students.

However, Korean language has ambiguous aspects due to the nature of the subject, so I couldn't be certain of a perfect score, but when the preliminary scoring results showed perfect scores in all subjects, I bragged about it to everyone in the neighborhood. Before CSAT, I went around asking people questions like 'What gift will you give me if I get a perfect score?' as a kind of self-hypnosis.

'Lottery-Like School Records'?... \\\"Distrust in Holistic Admissions Likely to Continue\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"[Provided by Yonhap News TV]\\n\\n(Sejong=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Hyo-seok = While the Ministry of Education announced on the 28th measures to expand regular admissions quotas at major Seoul universities along with strengthening fairness in student record comprehensive screening (holistic admissions), critics argue that there are no substantial measures to dispel field concerns about so-called 'lottery-like school records.'\\n\\nThe core of this announcement involves gradually reducing the reflection of non-curricular areas of school life records in university admissions, completely abolishing them by the 2024 academic year, and strengthening universities' disclosure of holistic admissions evaluation criteria and selection results.\\n\\nHowever, among parents and students who have advocated for 'regular admissions expansion,' criticism emerges that \\\"the fundamental reason we can't trust holistic admissions is that the level of school record writing differs by teacher, yet no effective measures for this are visible.\\\" This is why the modifier 'lottery-like' is often attached to school records.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education announced it would develop teacher training modules to strengthen teachers' evaluation and recording capabilities to resolve disparities in school record entries, expand such training, and operate continuous liaison and exchange programs between high school teachers and university admissions officers.\\n\\nFor 'detailed abilities and special remarks' (detailed remarks) written by subject teachers, they explained they would make entries mandatory in stages and create and distribute standard guidelines next year.\\n\\nHowever, Ms. Cho (47), who has a high school sophomore son, scoffed, saying \\\"Excellent teachers who write school records meticulously differ from the start in their interest and passion toward students,\\\" and \\\"Could my child's homeroom teacher, who is perfunctory and rigid, learn such passion through formal group education like training?\\\"\\n\\nAnother parent, Ms. Park (45), also raised her voice, saying \\\"Not only homeroom teachers but also the detailed remarks written by each subject teacher are important, yet even within one school, teachers' levels differ,\\\" and \\\"The Ministry of Education tells us to 'trust schools and teachers,' but what can we do about the anxiety that we're ruined if we get the wrong teacher, when there's no mechanism to wash away such fears?\\\"\\n\\n[Provided by Yonhap News TV]\\n\\nRegarding the complete abolition of non-curricular activities outside the regular curriculum from university admissions and the elimination of holistic admissions personal statements starting from the 2024 academic year when current 8th graders take university entrance exams, universities express dissatisfaction.\\n\\nThey argue that if universities want to see what career paths and aptitudes students have designed and worked toward, they need to look at personal statements as well as non-curricular activities, but removing all of these due to unfairness suspicions makes the purpose of operating holistic admissions meaningless.\\n\\nOne admissions expert worried, \\\"Wasn't it proven through holistic admissions fact-finding that universities don't hesitate to use illegal and irregular methods to secure excellent students first?\\\" adding \\\"If universities create variant screening methods or greatly strengthen interviews, it's students who will suffer.\\\"\\n\\nA high school teacher in Seoul said, \\\"If holistic admissions decrease and subject-based admissions increase, students will be driven into infinite school record [GPA] competition and dependence on 'pinpoint hagwons [hagwons known for accurately predicting exam questions] near high schools' will increase, making high school classes desolate.\\\"\\n\\nThere are also criticisms that while university admissions policies keep changing course with questionable effectiveness, leaving students, parents, and teachers in continued confusion, the only side smiling is the hagwon education market.\\n\\nFollowing the Ministry of Education's mention that essay and written response questions could be introduced from the 2028 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], there are already talks that essay hagwon education for elementary students will increase, or that if universities disclose detailed evaluation criteria to enhance holistic admissions transparency, customized admissions consulting for top-tier universities will become more

Former Justice Minister Cho Kuk leaving. [Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Kim Kye-yeon = The prosecution summoned and investigated former Justice Minister Cho Kuk (54) on the 14th, who is suspected of being involved in his wife's proxy stock investment and children's college entrance fraud.\\nThis comes 79 days after launching a forcible investigation with massive searches and seizures on August 27th, and one month since former Minister Cho resigned.\\nMinister Cho completely refused to answer prosecutors' questions and left the prosecution building after 8 hours. His legal team revealed immediately after the investigation that \\\"he judged it would be tedious and unnecessary to answer and explain each point\\\" and indicated they would not make statements to the prosecution in the future.\\nWith the suspect interrogation procedure completed for former Minister Cho, who is at the center of the allegations, the direction and intensity of judicial processing, including whether to request an arrest warrant against him, is expected to be the final hurdle of this investigation.\\nThe Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Anti-Corruption Investigation Division 2 (Chief Prosecutor Ko Hyung-gon) questioned former Minister Cho starting at 9:35 AM about the facts surrounding various allegations raised so far.\\nFormer Minister Cho's appearance at the prosecution was not disclosed to the media. He is known to have been investigated as a suspect with his attorney present.\\nFormer Minister Cho exercised his right to remain silent and returned home around 5:35 PM after completing the investigation review. Through his legal team, he stated: \\\"I have repeatedly made clear my position that I firmly deny all charges being discussed in relation to me in my wife's indictment and the media, as they are contrary to the facts\\\" and \\\"Since the investigation has been conducted for a long time, once the investigation team decides whether to prosecute, I intend to clarify the truth by determining right and wrong about everything in court.\\\"\\nThis is interpreted as effectively refusing future prosecution investigations. However, the prosecution stated that \\\"additional summons investigation is necessary,\\\" suggesting further attendance requests will be made.\\nFormer Minister Cho appears to be involved in a significant portion of the 15 criminal charges against his wife, Professor Chung Kyung-sim (57, detained), who was indicted for the second time on the 11th. The prosecution is expected to intensively question whether he knew that Professor Chung purchased stock in secondary battery company WFM under borrowed names.\\nWFM is an investee company of Kolink Private Equity (Kolink PE), the private fund management company in which Professor Chung invested 1.05 billion won [approximately $788,000 USD] under her name and her two children's names. The prosecution determined that Professor Chung obtained undisclosed information from Cho Beom-dong (36, arrested and indicted), former Minister Cho's second cousin who was the actual operator of Kolink PE, and purchased 144,304 shares of WFM stock under borrowed names from January to November last year.\\nThe prosecution has secured financial transaction records showing 50 million won [approximately $37,500 USD] was withdrawn from former Minister Cho's account on the same day Professor Chung purchased 120,000 WFM shares over-the-counter at the end of January last year, and has been tracking the flow of this money.\\nIf he knew the transferred money would be used for stock investment, it would violate the Public Officials Ethics Act's direct investment prohibition and could also result in charges of false property reporting. Professor Chung's illicit profits of 280.83 million won [approximately $211,000 USD] from stock investment or 'favorable information provision' could be viewed as bribes given to former Minister Cho by WFM.\\n[Provided by Busan Medical Center]\\n\\nAllegations surrounding his daughter's (28) scholarship at Pusan National University Medical School are also a key investigation target that could lead to bribery charges.\\nFormer Minister Cho's daughter received scholarships of 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] per semester for 6 semesters from 2016, totaling 12 million won [approximately $9,000 USD]. Noh Hwan-jung, current director of Busan Medical Center who provided the scholarship as her supervising professor, is known to have personally written a document stating that he played 'a role' in the process of selecting President Moon Jae-in's personal physician.\\nThe prosecution recently summoned Director Noh on the 11th and 13th consecutively to investigate the circumstances of scholarship provision, considering the possibility that former Minister Cho's influence, who was then Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs, affected the process of his appointment as Busan Medical Center director last June.\\nThe prosecution is also verifying whether former Minister Cho was involved in the process of his daughter and son (23) fraudulently obtaining internship certificates from Seoul National University Law School's Public Interest Human Rights Law Center.\\nThe daughter in 2009 and son in 2013 each received certificates stating they had interned at Seoul National University's Public Interest Human Rights Law Center and submitted them for college applications. The prosecution secured internship certificate files from former Minister Cho's home PC and has been investigating former Minister Cho's involvement as he was a law school professor at the time.\\nProfessor Chung's indictment includes charges of submitting her daughter's false internship certificate for college applications (uttering of falsely prepared official document). The prosecution wrote in the indictment that she \\\"gave her daughter an internship confirmation letter containing false information\\\" but did not reveal the certificate issuance process.\\nWhether he was involved in or aided evidence destruction is also under investigation.\\nThe prosecution secured testimony from Kim Kyung-rok (37), a Korea Investment & Securities private banker who managed the couple's assets, that when replacing the hard disk of the PC at their Bangbae-dong home in Seoul, former Minister Cho told him \\\"thank you for helping my wife.\\\"\\nSince Professor Chung led the response to private fund-related allegations during the confirmation hearing process, whether former Minister Cho himself knew that his explanations were false is expected to be a key issue.\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) The prosecution announced on the 14th that it was investigating former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, who is suspected of being involved in his wife's proxy stock investment and children's college entrance fraud. The photo shows former Justice Minister Cho Kuk leaving the Ministry of Justice at the Government Complex Gwacheon on the 14th after announcing his resignation. [Yonhap News file photo] photo@yna.co.kr\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho received and used management status reports prepared by Kolink Private Equity (Kolink PE), a private fund management company, to explain the allegations. The prosecution indicted Professor Chung on charges of instructing evidence fabrication, believing she instructed the false preparation of this report.\\nThe prosecution also considers investigation necessary regarding charges of hiring irregularities and sham litigation at Ungdong Academy involving his younger brother Cho (52, detained).\\nUngdong Academy is a school foundation in Gyeongnam Province operated by former Minister Cho's family, with his late father Cho Byeon-hyeon followed by his current mother Park Jung-sook (81) serving as chairwoman. Former Minister Cho served as a board member of Ungdong Academy from 1999-2009. The prosecution secured legal review documents regarding Korea Asset Management Corporation's (KAMCO) provisional seizure of Ungdong Academy from former Minister Cho's PC and has been verifying his involvement in sham litigation.\\nFormer Minister Cho acknowledges some involvement in the hiring process, including receiving requests from Ungdong Academy to prepare teacher employment exam questions and re-delegating them to professors in relevant fields. However, his position is that he does not precisely remember when he was requested to prepare questions and that it is unrelated to hiring irregularities.\\nThe prosecution reportedly could not complete all prepared questioning despite former Minister Cho's refusal to testify. Accordingly, they plan to summon former Minister Cho again soon to complete the interrogation. The prosecution is expected to carefully decide future investigation procedures, including requesting an arrest warrant, by comprehensively considering former Minister Cho's testimony attitude and other factors.\\ndada@yna.co.kr\\nTips to KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>2019/11/14 18:28 Transmission November 14, 2019, 18:28 Transmission\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5134, "output_tokens": 2150, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It is known that former Minister Cho is being investigated as a suspect with his lawyer present.\\nFormer Minister Cho appears to be involved in a significant portion of the 15 criminal charges against his wife, Professor Chung Kyung-sim (57, detained), Dongyang University, who was indicted for the second time on the 11th. Prosecutors are expected to focus on questioning whether he knew that Professor Chung purchased shares of secondary battery company WFM under borrowed names.\\nWFM is an investee company of Colink Private Equity (Colink PE), a private fund management company in which Professor Chung invested 1.05 billion won [approximately $790,000 USD] under her own name and those of her two children. Prosecutors have determined that Professor Chung obtained undisclosed information from Cho Beom-dong (36, indicted while detained), the actual operator of Colink PE and former Minister Cho's second cousin, and purchased 144,304 shares of WFM stock under borrowed names from January to November last year.\\nProsecutors have secured financial transaction records showing that 50 million won [approximately $38,000 USD] was withdrawn from former Minister Cho's account on the same day Professor Chung purchased 120,000 WFM shares over-the-counter at the end of January last year, and have been tracking the flow of this money.\\nIf he knew the transferred money would be used for stock investment, it would violate the Public Officials Ethics Act's prohibition on direct investment and could also face charges of false property reporting. The improper profit of 208,832,109 won [approximately $157,000 USD] that Professor Chung made from stock investment or the 'favorable information provision' could be viewed as bribes that WFM gave to former Minister Cho.\\n[Provided by Busan Medical Center]\\n\\nAllegations surrounding his daughter's (28) scholarship at Pusan National University Graduate School of Medicine are also a key subject of investigation that could develop into bribery charges.\\nFormer Minister Cho's daughter received scholarships of 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] each semester for 6 semesters from 2016, totaling 12 million won [approximately $9,000 USD]. Noh Hwan-jung, current director of Busan Medical Center who gave the scholarship as her supervising professor, is known to have personally written a document stating that he played 'a role' in the process of selecting President Moon Jae-in's personal physician.\\nWith the possibility that former Minister Cho's influence as presidential secretary for civil affairs at the time may have affected the process of being appointed as Busan Medical Center director in June, prosecutors recently summoned Director Noh on the 11th and 13th consecutively to investigate the circumstances of the scholarship payment.\\nProsecutors also plan to ask former Minister Cho whether he was involved in the process of his daughter and son (23) fraudulently obtaining internship certificates from Seoul National University Law School's Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center.\\nThe daughter received a certificate in 2009 and the son in 2013, each stating they had interned at Seoul National University's Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center, which they submitted for university admissions. Prosecutors have secured internship certificate files from former Minister Cho's home PC and have been investigating whether former Minister Cho, who was serving as a law professor at the time, was involved.\\nProfessor Chung's charges include submitting her daughter's false internship certificate for university admissions (exercising falsely prepared official documents). Prosecutors wrote in the indictment that she 'handed her daughter an internship confirmation letter with false content,' but did not reveal the certificate issuance process.\\nWhether he was involved in or aided evidence destruction is also subject to investigation.\\nProsecutors have secured testimony that former Minister Cho told Kim Kyung-rok (37), a Korea Investment & Securities private banker who managed the couple's assets, 'Thank you for helping my wife' when the hard disk of the PC at their Bangbae-dong home in Seoul was replaced.\\nSince Professor Chung led the response to private fund-related allegations during the confirmation hearing process, whether former Minister Cho himself knew that the explanations he provided were false is expected to be a key issue.\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Prosecutors announced on the 14th that they are investigating former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, who is suspected of being involved in his wife's stock investments under borrowed names and his children's university admission fraud.

[Yonhap News file photo] photo@yna.co.kr\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho received and used operation status reports prepared by Colink Private Equity (Colink PE), a private fund management company, to explain the allegations. Prosecutors believe Professor Chung instructed the false preparation of this report and indicted her on charges of instructing evidence fabrication.\\nProsecutors also believe investigation is necessary regarding the hiring irregularities and sham litigation charges involving his younger brother Cho (52, detained while indicted) at Ungdong Academy.\\nUngdong Academy is a Gyeongnam regional school foundation operated by former Minister Cho's family, with his late father Cho Byeon-hyeon and currently his mother Park Jeong-suk (81) serving as board chairperson. Former Minister Cho served as a board member of Ungdong Academy from 1999 to 2009. Prosecutors have secured legal review documents regarding Korea Asset Management Corporation's (KAMCO) provisional seizure of Ungdong Academy from former Minister Cho's PC and have been confirming his involvement in sham litigation.\\nFormer Minister Cho acknowledges that he was partially involved in the hiring process, including receiving requests from Ungdong Academy to prepare teacher recruitment exam questions and re-delegating them to professors in related fields.

It was reported that prosecutors questioned Mr. Cho about money and valuables charges other than hiring irregularities and disguised lawsuits during three summons from the 27th of last month to the 1st of this month, before filing the arrest warrant.\\n\\nMr. Cho, who complains of health issues including herniated discs, appeared at the prosecutors' office on the 21st wearing a neck brace and sitting in a wheelchair. He subsequently waited in the Seoul metropolitan area in preparation for the re-filing of an arrest warrant and was recently hospitalized at a hospital in Busan.\\n\\nWith Mr. Cho's consent, prosecutors are reviewing his medical records to determine whether his health condition, including herniated discs, is severe enough to make prison life unbearable. Mr. Cho's side said, \\\"There was a brief investigation related to receiving money and valuables before the first warrant was filed, but it was excluded from the warrant. To add it, investigation would need to be conducted before filing an arrest warrant.\\\"\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Park Dong-ju = Former Justice Minister Cho Kuk leaves his residence in Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul on the 28th. pdj6635@yna.co.kr\\n\\nProsecutors have reportedly also discovered evidence that Professor Chung Kyung-sim (57, under arrest), wife of former Minister Cho and professor at Dongyang University, received part of the funds for purchasing WFM (secondary battery company) stocks through an ATM near the Blue House [the presidential office].\\n\\nWFM is an investee company of Colink Private Equity (Colink PE), the private fund management company in which Professor Chung invested 1.05 billion won [approximately $800,000 USD] under her name and her two children's names. Prosecutors determined that Professor Chung obtained undisclosed information from Cho Beom-dong (36, arrested and indicted), former Minister Cho's fifth cousin who was the actual operator of Colink PE, and purchased 120,000 shares of WFM stock at 5,000 won [approximately $3.80 USD] per share under borrowed names in January last year. WFM stock price, which was on an upward trend at the time, jumped to a peak of 7,500 won [approximately $5.70 USD] in February last year.\\n\\nProsecutors reportedly secured transaction records showing that 50 million won [approximately $38,000 USD] out of the 600 million won [approximately $455,000 USD] in stock purchase funds came from former Minister Cho's account through ATM. If he knew the transferred money would be used for stock investment, it would violate the Public Service Ethics Act's direct investment prohibition and could also face charges of false property reporting.\\n\\nLegal circles analyze that if WFM provided stocks below market price expecting help related to former Minister Cho's duties as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs at the time, bribery charges could also apply. WFM, which originally operated an English education business, entered the secondary battery field, a national policy project, after being taken over by Colink PE in October 2017.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho maintains the position that he \\\"never purchased WFM stock.\\\" Prosecutors plan to summon former Minister Cho soon to investigate whether he directly made the account transfer and how much he was involved in the stock purchase process.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho also faces allegations of illegally issuing internship certificates at Seoul National University's Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center for his daughter (28) and son (23), and of aiding in evidence destruction by replacing the hard disk of a PC at his Bangbae-dong residence in Seoul. Prosecutors plan to maximize the specificity of circumstances linking former Minister Cho to various allegations through Professor Chung. Professor Chung, who was arrested on the 24th, was summoned to prosecutors on the following day and the 27th for investigation related to admissions fraud and evidence concealment charges, but reportedly continues to completely deny the charges.\\n\\ndada@yna.co.kr\\nTips to KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>\\n2019/10/28 15:24 transmission 2019 October 28, 15:24 transmission\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3910, "output_tokens": 1611, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This time, suspicions surrounding former Justice Minister Cho Kuk's children's college admissions have triggered debates about the fairness of the current admissions system. In particular, the education community appears startled by President Moon Jae-in's sudden statement about 'expanding the proportion of regular admissions [jeongsihji].' The expansion of regular admissions directly contradicts a series of policies that the Ministry of Education has prepared for normalizing high school education. President Moon appears to be accelerating university admissions system reform centered on expanding the proportion of regular admissions by convening a meeting of ministers related to educational reform on the 25th, just three days after mentioning the expansion of regular admissions in the National Assembly. This appears intended to quickly proceed with direction-setting work to minimize confusion for test-takers and parents due to frequent admissions system reforms. Despite much controversy, the fact that President Moon is willing to roll up his sleeves and directly address the sensitive issue of university admissions likely means he has positioned this issue as a core matter for creating a fair society.\\n\\nWhile presiding over the meeting of ministers related to educational reform, President Moon clarified the intent behind his statement on expanding regular admissions. President Moon drew a line, saying \\\"(expanding the proportion of early admissions [susi]) should only be pursued after fairness and transparency in school records and trust in university evaluations have been established first.\\\" At the same time, he emphasized, \\\"Until then, while I know regular admissions aren't a panacea, we should still listen to the voices of test-takers and parents who say that regular admissions are fairer than early admissions for now.\\\" The President's remarks reflect his perception that the sense of loss felt by the people following the 'Cho Kuk incident' stems from distrust in early admission processes. He views unfair university admissions and other educational systems as having deteriorated into means for passing down parents' social and economic status and privileges to the next generation. The main target of expanding regular admissions appears to be Seoul's top-tier universities, which have high proportions of early admissions centered on comprehensive school record evaluation [hakjong].\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education now faces the task of finding both the proportion of regular admissions expansion that can guarantee fairness in university admissions and measures to normalize public education. Regarding the expansion of regular admissions, it's difficult to find an 'answer' that satisfies everyone because the interests of admission stakeholders—high schools, universities, parents, the hagwon industry, and educational organizations—differ from each other. Fortunately, there is a verified reference point for discussing the expansion of regular admissions. This is the result of public opinion surveys released by the National Education Council's Public Deliberation Committee on University Admission Reform last year. What received much support in the public opinion survey at the time was a plan to raise the proportion of regular admissions to 45% or higher. Additionally, the citizen participation group considered 39.6% to be an appropriate ratio for CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]-centered admissions. The Ministry of Education should find the golden ratio between regular and early admissions based on such data. It should also present groundbreaking improvement measures that completely eliminate so-called 'golden spoon' elements from comprehensive school record evaluation.\\n\\nMeasures to normalize high school public education should also be refined to get back on track. The Moon Jae-in administration presented the 'Three-Stage Roadmap for High School System Reform' and the 'High School Credit System' early in its term. The roadmap is divided into Stage 1: improving high school admission systems, Stage 2: converting autonomous private high schools, foreign language high schools, and international high schools to general high schools, and Stage 3: high school system reform. The High School Credit System, which will be fully introduced in 2025 to eliminate high school hierarchies, is a system that allows high school students to select and attend classes they want like university students, and graduate if they meet certain credit standards. The High School System Reform Roadmap and High School Credit System are intended to change the foundation of high school education. The Ministry of Education should revise and supplement these two pillars to ensure that public education normalization and innovation are implemented without disruption. The phrase the Ministry of Education must be tired of hearing is 'education is a hundred-year plan.' We hope that the university admission reform plan the Ministry of Education will present in November will include both short and long-term measures that guarantee fairness in admissions while normalizing high school education.\\n\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>2019/10/25 15:12 transmitted 2019 October 25 15:12 transmitted\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3436, "output_tokens": 1138, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

organizations voiced concerns in unison, saying \\\"the government is being swayed by public opinion.\\\"\\n\\nParents are confused but generally welcoming.\\n\\nDeputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Yoo Eun-hye said at a briefing after the Education Reform-related Ministers' Meeting held at the Blue House that day, \\\"We will adjust upward the proportion of regular admissions centered on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) for Seoul-area universities with high proportions of comprehensive student record admissions and essay-writing exam admissions,\\\" and \\\"The rate of increase will be announced next month after listening to the contents of last year's college entrance exam reform public deliberation agreement and field opinions.\\\"\\n\\nThe education sector poured out concerns that the government is once again pursuing an increase in regular admission ratios just one year after deciding, through last year's major confusion and unprecedented public deliberation process, to raise the regular admission ratio to over 30% for the 2022 academic year college entrance exams.\\n\\nKorean Federation of Teachers' Associations spokesperson Cho Seong-cheol said, \\\"This is a time to settle the direction decided through last year's public deliberation, but hasty reform plans should not emerge due to political demands or prejudgments,\\\" and \\\"The college entrance system should be decided with the Ministry of Education at the center, listening to various stakeholders' opinions and considering various aspects such as university autonomy and public education normalization.\\\"\\n\\nEarlier, when the President mentioned entrance exam system reforms including increasing the proportion of regular admissions in his policy address, the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations expressed concern, saying \\\"This revealed discord between the party, government, and Blue House, which is worrying in that it caused confusion and mixed signals for students and parents\\\" and \\\"It could be seen as politics intervening in education.\\\"\\n\\nProgressive educational organizations such as the National Association of Provincial and Metropolitan Superintendents of Education and KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) are criticizing that if the fairness of comprehensive student record admissions is in doubt, the comprehensive student record system should be improved rather than using this as an excuse to expand regular admissions.\\n\\nThe superintendents' association stated, \\\"Regular admissions centered on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) encourage curriculum disruption and create problem-solving-centered classes,\\\" and \\\"As comprehensive student record admissions have taken root, results showing curriculum normalization are emerging, so we oppose expanding regular admissions.\\\"\\n\\nThe association emphasized, \\\"After announcing the 2022 academic year college entrance exam reform plan (last year), the Ministry of Education repeatedly emphasized that it would not discuss expanding regular admissions on the grounds that it would increase confusion in school sites,\\\" and \\\"We must listen to the voices of educational stakeholders so that college entrance system improvement plans for normalizing school education can be prepared.\\\"\\n\\nKTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) also argued in a statement, \\\"Education is not a sacrifice for breaking through the current situation,\\\" and \\\"The regular admission expansion policy should be immediately withdrawn and the entrance exam system should be improved with a focus on public education normalization.\\\"\\n\\nPrivate Education Concern-Free World pointed out, \\\"If regular admissions are expanded, the high school credit system that allows high school students to choose and take classes according to their career paths and aptitudes will face difficulties even before implementation,\\\" and \\\"Rather than just solving the 'microscopic problem' of securing fairness in college entrance exams, a big picture is needed to solve the problem of parents' privileges being passed down to their children through education.\\\"\\n\\n[Provided by Yonhap News TV]\\n\\nParents are confused but generally welcoming the expansion of regular admissions.\\n\\nOne parent with a third-year middle school child said, \\\"If you go to a general high school, it's difficult to keep up with the 'early admission spec-building' of autonomous private high schools or special purpose high schools,\\\" and \\\"In general high schools, students with good school records generally do well on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) too. For general high school parents who can't prepare for early admissions (as much as autonomous private schools, etc.), it's good that the balance between early admission and regular admission ratios is matched (with regular admissions being expanded).\\\"\\n\\nLee Man-gi, director of Uway Educational Evaluation Research Institute, said, \\\"Parents in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area like the expansion of regular admissions,\\\" and \\\"Even if they didn't expect it, they are welcoming it for now.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Director Lee added, \\\"Among students who entered high school this year, in the case of students who gave up autonomous private high schools or special purpose high schools and went to general high schools because the regular admission ratio was only increased to 'over 30%' level, they might feel wronged if the regular admission ratio is greatly expanded.\\\"\\n\\nHe predicted, \\\"Universities also prefer early admissions out of greed to secure excellent students first, but in terms of student selection convenience, they prefer regular admissions more,\\\" and \\\"Universities will increase the regular admission ratio considering the number of students who are not selected in early admissions and are carried over to regular admissions.\\\"\\n\\nOh Jong-un, evaluation director of Jongno Academy Sky Education, explained, \\\"There are bound to be more students with poor school records than good students. That's why parents and test-takers have no choice but to welcome the expansion of regular admissions.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Oh predicted, \\\"If the regular admission ratio is suddenly raised a lot, the major framework of the college entrance system will shake,\\\" and \\\"Universities will adjust the regular admission ratio to around 30-40%.\\\"\\n\\njylee24@yna.co.kr\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder(c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>2019/10/25 13:27 transmission 2019 October 25 13:27 transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3957, "output_tokens": 1582, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Must Avoid Disputes Over Fairness\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"(Seoul=Yonhap News) As prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for Chung Kyung-sim, a professor at Dongyang University and wife of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, the so-called 'Cho Kuk family' investigation is reaching its peak. The charges prosecutors have applied to Professor Chung number as many as 11. Starting with suspicions about fabricating Dongyang University commendation certificates and other children's college admission irregularities, a whole slew of charges have been applied including private equity fund investment, obstruction of business related to replacing PC hard disk drives at her Bangbae-dong [a Seoul neighborhood] home and Dongyang University research office, embezzlement, and instructing evidence fabrication. Prosecutors have also re-summoned former Minister Cho's younger brother, who is implicated in Ungdong Academy hiring irregularities and false litigation suspicions, and plan to re-request an arrest warrant for him soon.\\n\\nSuspicions related to former Minister Cho's family and the prosecution's investigation into them have been sharp issues that heated up the entire nation over the past couple of months. It shook not only the political sphere but the entire country, and public opinion was split to polar extremes. Considering this, whether an arrest warrant is issued for Professor Chung, who is considered a key figure in the suspicions, is expected to cause considerable repercussions. This is because it will be the court's first judicial judgment on the prosecution's investigation, which has sparked considerable controversy including the surprise indictment of Professor Chung on the very night of former Minister Cho's personnel hearing and an 11-hour search and seizure of their home. If the warrant is issued, the final-stage investigation will gain momentum, but if it's rejected, not only will the investigation's drive be significantly weakened, but responsibility questions and even resignation issues regarding Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl, who has led this investigation, could emerge.\\n\\nInside and outside legal circles, there is widespread speculation that considering the explosive nature of this case and the prosecution's investigation situation, direct questioning of former Minister Cho will be inevitable after the decision on whether to issue Professor Chung's arrest warrant. This speculation stems from the view that investigation of former Minister Cho in some form will likely be the period mark for this investigation. Prosecutors have not abandoned their suspicion that former Minister Cho is a 'co-principal offender' regarding the charges Professor Chung faces. He was a law professor when his two children received internship certificates from Seoul National University's Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center, and he was affiliated with this center. Suspicions have also been raised that former Minister Cho knew about Professor Chung replacing PC hard drives at their home and Dongyang University research office but aided and abetted this.\\n\\nProsecutors must thoroughly investigate all suspicions raised so far, but must keep in mind that the blade aimed at 'Cho Kuk's family' could boomerang back toward the prosecution organization itself, and must not be the slightest bit negligent in reducing disputes over equity and fairness until the investigation is concluded. Regardless of prosecutors' intentions, this investigation has had an enormous direct and indirect impact on real politics from the very beginning. At the same time, it's true that there have been considerable suspicions that they are conducting a large-scale investigation to obstruct prosecution reform. Therefore, to minimize fairness disputes surrounding the investigation of 'Cho Kuk's family,' it's also important to thoroughly investigate the National Assembly 'fast track collision' complaint case without leaving a single point of suspicion. Regarding these cases, the public will vividly remember Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl's statement that he would 'thoroughly investigate according to law and principles without looking left or right.'\\n\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo <Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited> October 21, 2019 5:36 PM dispatch October 21, 2019 5:36 PM dispatch\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3159, "output_tokens": 969, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is because former Minister Cho was affiliated with the Public Interest and Human Rights Law Center while serving as a professor at Seoul National University's College of Law at the time.\\n\\nAllegations have also been raised that former Minister Cho knew about and aided Professor Chung when she replaced PC hard disks at her home and Dongyang University research office immediately after prosecutors' first search and seizure. Prosecutors are considering charges of instigation of evidence concealment regarding Professor Chung's hard disk replacement and removal.\\n\\nProsecutors conducted detailed investigations into conversation contents between former Minister Cho and Kim Kyung-rok, a private banker (PB) at Korea Investment & Securities who serves as the Cho family's asset manager and helped with the PC hard replacement.\\n\\nFurthermore, prosecutors are reportedly seeking to directly hear former Minister Cho's position on whether he knew about the private equity fund's investment destinations and contents, and whether he was aware of allegations of false litigation and hiring irregularities at Woongdong Academy, a private educational foundation operated by his family.\\n\\nFormer Minister Cho and Professor Chung have also been accused by the civic organization Speculative Capital Watch Center of bribery and violation of the Public Officials Ethics Act. The organization claimed that 'those who provided bribes sought complex benefits by utilizing the influence of Cho Kuk, a power player in the current government, and paid his wife Chung Kyung-sim monthly consulting fees of 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] plus incentives.'\\n\\n[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nWhile prosecutors are conducting detention investigations of Superintendent Yoon [surname withheld], who worked alongside former Minister Cho when he served as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs at the Blue House [Korea's presidential office], on charges including brokerage under the Aggravated Punishment Act for Specific Crimes and violation of the Capital Markets Act, the possibility that the investigation could spread to connections with the civil affairs senior secretary's office at that time cannot be ruled out.\\n\\nProsecutors are expected to schedule summoning investigations of former Minister Cho as soon as the decision on whether to issue an arrest warrant for Professor Chung is made.\\n\\nLawyer Kim Jong-min, a former prosecutor, said, 'Prosecutors' investigation target was former Minister Cho from the beginning,' adding, 'Since there are various allegations that former Minister Cho was involved in criminal charges, prosecutors are expected to focus on proving this going forward.'\\n\\nLawyer Kang Shin-eop said, 'The fact that Professor Chung denies the charges and there are concerns about evidence destruction and coordinating stories are grounds for warrant issuance,' but added, 'However, since the investigation has already progressed considerably and considering Professor Chung's health problems, there's also a possibility the court could reject the warrant.

They plan to verify whether other family members also knew about the hiring corruption.\\n\\nAccording to the indictment of hiring corruption brokers A and B on the 16th, brother Mr. Cho instructed his elementary school junior A in fall 2015: \\\"We are hiring a regular full-time social studies teacher at Ungdong Middle School. Find out if there's anyone who wants to be hired as a regular teacher even if they have to pay between 100 million and 150 million won [approximately $75,000-113,000 USD]. If you bring the money, I'll give you an introduction fee.\\\"\\n\\nOn December 31 of the same year, A met with an applicant's parents at a hotel coffee shop in Changwon, Gyeongnam, together with B who was preparing to establish Ungdong Middle School's baseball team. They proposed: \\\"We'll make sure you pass the hiring exam if you give us 130 million won [approximately $98,000 USD]. First, give us 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] as a down payment, then give us the remaining 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] when we hand over the written exam questions and answer sheet.\\\" They also conveyed plans to provide the practical exam assignments and interview questions in advance after passing the first written exam.\\n\\nA and B received the 30 million won down payment in 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD] checks four days later. On January 13 of the following year, they exchanged the written exam questions and answer sheet they received from Mr. Cho for 100 million won. This applicant, who paid a total of 130 million won, passed the written exam with a perfect score among 24 test-takers. They also received the highest score of 95.5 points among 5 candidates in the second practical and interview evaluation and were hired as a regular teacher.\\n\\nThe 2017 hiring corruption followed the same pattern.\\n\\nA met with the father of an applicant who was working as a temporary teacher at another nearby middle school and proposed '100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD].' When the applicant's side hesitated, saying \\\"the amount is too large,\\\" they reached an agreement after negotiations to receive 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD] as a down payment and 70 million won [approximately $53,000 USD] as success fee. This applicant also passed the Ungdong Middle School social studies teacher appointment exam as the 'top scorer.'\\n\\n(Changwon=Yonhap News) Reporter Kim Dong-min = Ungdong Middle School in Jinhae-gu, Changwon, Gyeongnam on the afternoon of the 19th. This school is a private middle school owned by Ungdong Educational Foundation, which is owned by Justice Minister candidate Cho Kuk's family. 2019.8.19 image@yna.co.kr\\n\\nThe appointment plan secured by prosecutors states that written exams would be commissioned to Dongyang University. Also, to prevent exam question leaks, the board chairman would directly commission the written exam questions, store the questions, and deliver them to the administrative office director 1 hour before the exam starts. The practical assignments and interview questions were to be finalized through consultation between only the vice-principal and principal.\\n\\nMr. Cho reportedly told prosecutors that he secretly took exam questions from his mother Park Jung-sook's (81) house, who is the board chairman. Prosecutors plan to verify how Mr. Cho found out about practical assignments and whether other family members involved in Ungdong Educational Foundation operations, including Ms. Park and Professor Chung, were also related to the hiring corruption.\\n\\nMr. Cho is also suspected of destroying evidence and helping accomplices flee. When hiring corruption allegations were raised by media in late August, he instructed A: \\\"Meet B and get a fact confirmation document stating that the media reports are not true.\\\" A had B write a falsely prepared fact confirmation document and even obtained a seal certificate.\\n\\nAfter receiving this report, Mr. Cho again instructed through A: \\\"Tell B to go to the Philippines until things quiet down,\\\" ordering overseas flight. B departed for Manila, Philippines through Gimhae International Airport that same day. Mr. Cho also handed 3.5 million won [approximately $2,600 USD] to the brokers as flight funds.\\n\\nA and B kept some of the 210 million won [approximately $158,000 USD] they received from applicants as hiring payment as commission fees and delivered most of it to Mr. Cho. Prosecutors identified circumstances where Mr. Cho led the crimes through the arrested brokers and referred the two brokers to trial the previous day on charges of breach of trust, bribery, and obstruction of business.\\n\\nMeanwhile, when an arrest warrant was requested for Mr. Cho, he requested postponement of interrogation on the 7th, the day before the pre-arrest suspect interrogation (warrant substantive review), claiming he needed lumbar disc surgery. When prosecutors forcibly summoned him the next day by visiting a Busan hospital where he was hospitalized, he gave up the interrogation but received a decision rejecting the arrest warrant.\\n\\nProsecutors view that custodial investigation is inevitable as Mr. Cho is the main culprit of hiring corruption who planned and instructed the crimes and took most of the bribes, and also has breach of trust charges for causing tens of billions of won [approximately $75 million-750 million USD] in damages to Ungdong Educational Foundation through false construction payment lawsuits, so they plan to request an arrest warrant again soon. Mr. Cho is known to still claim surgery is necessary while not presenting objective records to support this to prosecutors.\\n\\nLiberty Korea Party lawmaker Kim Do-eup claimed that Seoul Central District Court warrant-dedicated chief judge Myeong Jae-kwon rejected the arrest warrant despite knowing about Mr. Cho's 'malingering.' He said that even after receiving medical opinions stating surgery was unnecessary and hospital closed-circuit TV analysis data supporting this from prosecutors, the judge cited 'health condition' as grounds for rejecting the arrest warrant.\\n\\nLawmaker Kim revealed that Mr. Cho freely moved the arm he complained of having muscle abnormalities and paralysis, and was even caught by medical staff smoking in his hospital room.

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n(Sejong·Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporters Lee Hyo-seok and Lee Jae-young = The education sector responded that the government's plan to convert autonomous private high schools, foreign language high schools, and international high schools all at once to regular high schools in March 2025 was an \\\"expected sequence of events.\\\" However, opinions for and against were divided by organization.\\n\\nAccording to the Democratic Party of Korea on the 14th, the Ministry of Education discussed a plan to collectively convert autonomous private high schools, foreign language high schools, and international high schools to regular high schools in 2025 at a ruling party-government-administration consultative meeting on the 18th of last month. The Ministry of Education said it would revise the Elementary and Secondary Education Act enforcement ordinance at the end of this year or early next year for the bulk conversion.\\n\\nThe government is presenting the necessity of bulk conversion by citing that the high school credit system will be fully introduced in the 2025 school year. The high school credit system, where students choose and take classes they want, must be implemented together with 'absolute evaluation of high school grades' (achievement evaluation), and if absolute evaluation of school records is implemented, autonomous private high schools are likely to occupy a very advantageous position compared to regular high schools in university admissions.\\n\\nLee Man-ki, director of the Uway Education Evaluation Research Institute and a university admissions expert, explained, \\\"To introduce the high school credit system, absolute evaluation of high school grades must be implemented,\\\" adding, \\\"When absolute evaluation of school records is implemented, autonomous private high schools become greatly advantaged, so the credit system cannot be introduced without eliminating autonomous private high schools.\\\"\\n\\nProgressive-leaning education superintendents and education organizations have consistently argued for revising laws to convert autonomous private high schools all at once to regular high schools.\\n\\nEspecially as major confusion arose during this year's re-designation evaluation (operational performance evaluation), voices have grown louder that bulk conversion is necessary to prevent such confusion from repeating.\\n\\nJeon Gyeong-won, director of the KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) True Education Research Institute, said, \\\"The government has set the right direction for now,\\\" explaining, \\\"If autonomous private high schools are not converted to regular high schools before the full introduction of the credit system, the situation would become unmanageable later.\\\"\\n\\nHe analyzed, \\\"I understand that voices saying it's difficult are coming from within autonomous private high schools as applicants decrease,\\\" adding, \\\"(The government plan) also coincides with the current trend of autonomous private high schools wanting to convert to regular high schools due to financial problems and other issues.\\\"\\n\\nKu Bon-chang, policy director of Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice in Education, said, \\\"The government plan is rational in that it set a 'grace period' to convert to regular high schools in 2025 after revising laws at the end of this year or early next year,\\\" adding, \\\"I evaluate this as a plan moving toward 'upward equalization' where each regular high school operates diverse curricula through the credit system, rather than 'educational diversification' through the high school system.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, Cho Seong-cheol, spokesperson for the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations, pointed out, \\\"Before converting autonomous private high schools to regular high schools, proof is needed that regular high schools can also provide diverse education suited to students' talents and aptitudes,\\\" adding, \\\"If they had said they would convert autonomous private high schools to regular high schools after gaining trust that regular high schools can also provide diverse education, there would have been no one to oppose it.\\\"\\n\\nHe argued, \\\"There are concerns from the education field that even if the credit system is implemented, it will only result in a slight increase in elective subjects because it's difficult to realize a credit system at the high school level where students choose and take all classes like in universities,\\\" adding, \\\"It's unreasonable to eliminate schools that already operate diverse curricula when it's unclear at what level the credit system will operate (just because the credit system will be implemented).\\\"\\n\\nSpokesperson Cho added, \\\"The high school system should not change just because the administration changes,\\\" saying, \\\"The high school system should be designed in a direction that can provide diverse curricula to students and nurture talent suitable for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and this should be specified in law.\\\"\\n\\nThe government's bulk conversion plan for autonomous private high schools, foreign language high schools, and international high schools is expected to affect the popularity of autonomous private high schools starting from this year's high school admissions.\\n\\nLee Young-deok, director of the Daesung Academic Development Research Institute at Daesung hagwon, predicted, \\\"The preference for not only autonomous private high schools but also foreign language high schools and international high schools, which was already declining due to reduced special talent admissions, will fall further,\\\" adding, \\\"There's a possibility that preference for so-called 'prestigious regular high school' areas like Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Mok-dong will emerge again.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee Man-ki also predicted, \\\"Would students apply to schools that are obviously going to close?\\\" adding, \\\"Since the Ministry of Education is also reviewing plans to abolish extracurricular areas in the comprehensive school record evaluation for university early admissions, if even curricular areas disappear, autonomous private high schools will have no advantages in university admissions, so their popularity will decline, if not by a large margin.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, there's also a prediction that popularity will be maintained based on the fact that if autonomous private high schools are converted to regular high schools in 2025 as the Ministry of Education plans, students who entered before then are likely to maintain their autonomous private high school student status until graduation.\\n\\nThis view suggests that even if autonomous private high schools and foreign language high schools are converted to regular high schools, they may maintain their standing as 'prestigious regular high schools' in their respective regions due to differentiated curricula or teacher quality.\\n\\nYu Seong-ryong, director of the STUnitas Education Research Institute, pointed out, \\\"2025 is during the next administration, and education policies have always changed later depending on the president or administration,\\\" adding, \\\"From the perspective of current elementary and middle school parents, there's still time, but they would be concerned about whether there might be confusion later.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation":

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nReactions of bewilderment emerge from within and outside the prosecution. They argue it lacks equity to not arrest Mr. Cho, the final destination of the money, when two others—another Mr. Cho and Mr. Park—who acted as brokers delivering money to him have both been arrested.\\n\\nProfessor Lee Choong-sang of Kyungpook National University Law School, who previously served as warrant-dedicated chief judge at Seoul Central District Court, criticized in a letter sent to acquaintances: \\\"Today, when the arrest warrant request for Minister Cho's younger brother was dismissed, will be a day when the court itself created a blemish,\\\" adding \\\"Based on the (hiring corruption) crime alone, there are concerns about flight, so arrest should be made, not dismissal.\\\"\\n\\nThe brokers also generally acknowledged the facts during prosecution investigation, and the amounts they received as commission fees were small sums under 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD]. However, strong indications of attempts at evidence destruction including overseas flight influenced their arrests. The court stated when issuing Park's arrest warrant on the 4th that \\\"there are concerns about flight or evidence destruction.\\\" However, it made no particular judgment on Mr. Cho's charges of instructing such evidence destruction (instructing evidence destruction).\\n\\nJudge Myeong distinguished Ungdong School Foundation fraudulent litigation charges as 'main crimes' and hiring corruption charges as 'breach of trust bribery portion.' The judgment was that 'main crimes' are disputable while the 'breach of trust bribery portion' is acknowledged by Mr. Cho himself, so it's not a matter requiring custody investigation.\\n\\nThis is interpreted as aligning with claims that 'Mr. Cho's hiring corruption is separate case investigation.' The implication is that the prosecution, to arrest Mr. Cho temporarily, sought out hiring corruption charges not directly related to the fraudulent litigation charges that were originally the main suspected issues and included them in the warrant's criminal facts.\\n\\nThe prosecution maintains that hiring corruption suspicions also began investigation through the same process as other branches of investigation like private equity funds and Ungdong School Foundation, following media reports and criminal complaints based on informant tips in late August. A prosecution official stated: \\\"Fraudulent litigation and hiring corruption are two pillars of Ungdong School Foundation-related suspicions.

Later, Ungdong Hagwon claimed financial difficulties due to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) foreign exchange crisis and did not pay 1.6 billion won [approximately $1.2 million USD] in construction costs to Goryeo City Development.\\n\\nSubsequently, Mr. Cho and his ex-wife Ms. Cho (name withheld) filed construction payment lawsuits against Ungdong Hagwon in 2006 and 2017, obtaining judgments ordering payment of a total of 5.2 billion won [approximately $3.9 million USD] including delayed interest.\\n\\nUngdong Hagwon abandoned its defense in both lawsuits and lost. This raised suspicions that Minister Cho's family conducted fraudulent litigation to transfer Ungdong Hagwon assets to Mr. Cho. The construction payment debt is reportedly now worth around 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD] due to accumulated interest.\\n\\nMr. Cho also faces charges (breach of trust and bribery) for receiving back-money from parents of teaching applicants at Ungdong Hagwon in exchange for hiring. The suspicion is that he received 200 million won [approximately $150,000 USD] - 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] per person - for hiring two Ungdong Middle School teachers, and the applicants who paid money were actually hired.\\n\\nTwo other individuals, Ms. Cho (name withheld) and Mr. Park (name withheld), who delivered back-money from teaching applicants to Mr. Cho and received service fees, have already been detained.\\n\\nThe court's rejection of the arrest warrant also serves as evidence that the prosecution's evidence regarding Ungdong Hagwon fraudulent litigation is not solid.

Whether prosecutors seek an arrest warrant and whether the court issues one is expected to have major repercussions on the political situation.\\n\\n◇ Closed-door summons under tight security\\n\\nProfessor Jung appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office in Seocho-dong around 9 AM under thorough security.\\n\\nProsecutors had initially announced they would have Professor Jung \\\"appear through the first-floor entrance of the building according to principle,\\\" leading to expectations of a public summons.\\n\\nHowever, prosecutors suddenly reversed this policy the previous day and conducted a closed-door summons. Many analysts believe this was influenced by repeated warnings from the Blue House [Korea's presidential office] and the ruling party, as well as large-scale candlelight vigils.\\n\\nProfessor Jung's summons came 37 days after prosecutors began full-scale forced investigation on August 27, conducting massive search and seizure operations related to suspicions about Minister Cho's family regarding private equity funds, his daughter's fraudulent university admission, and Woong-dong Academy [a hagwon].\\n\\nAs Professor Jung is at the center of various suspicions, prosecutors were expected to summon her since last month, but the timing was delayed longer than initially anticipated.\\n\\nWhile prosecutors cited Professor Jung's health condition as the ostensible reason, it's known that there was a 'tug-of-war' with her legal counsel over the advantages and disadvantages of the summons timing.\\n\\nFor prosecutors as well, considering the practical difficulties of repeatedly summoning the wife of a sitting Justice Minister, they reportedly summoned her today after solidifying the facts they would confront Professor Jung with through peripheral investigations.\\n\\n◇ More than 5 potential charges mentioned... Issues include 'co-conspiracy with 5th cousin nephew' and 'Public Officials Ethics Act'\\n\\nWhile prosecutors chose a closed-door summons method to prevent unnecessary controversy such as 'disgrace investigation,' they are not expected to moderate the level and intensity of questioning Professor Jung.\\n\\nProsecutors are expected to conduct intensive 'compressed investigation' based on evidence gathered through continuous summoning of related persons and five rounds of massive search and seizure operations.\\n\\nObservations from within and outside legal circles suggest that Professor Jung could face more than five charges.\\n\\nFirst, Professor Jung has already been indicted for forging a commendation letter from the Dongyang University president (document forgery) to help her daughter Cho (28) gain admission to Pusan National University School of Medicine and other institutions.\\n\\nProsecutors are also examining additional charges such as using the forged commendation letter in multiple domestic medical school admissions (uttering forged documents) and obstructing universities' admission processes (obstruction of official duties/business obstruction).\\n\\nRegarding private equity fund suspicions, Professor Jung is suspected of holding stocks under borrowed names in Colink Private Equity (PE), a private fund management company where Minister Cho's 5th cousin nephew Cho Beom-dong (36, arrested) is identified as the real owner, and of intervening in investee company management.\\n\\nCharges could include violations of the Capital Markets Act, which requires separation of fund management and investment, and violations of the Public Officials Ethics Act, which prohibits direct investment by public officials and their spouses.\\n\\nProsecutors suspect that Professor Jung received 1 billion won [approximately $750,000 USD] out of the 1.3 billion won [approximately $975,000 USD] that Cho allegedly embezzled from investee company WFM in August last year. This means they are examining the possibility that Professor Jung was an accomplice to 'embezzlement.' The nature of the 14 million won [approximately $10,500 USD] she received monthly at 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] per month under the name of consulting fees from WFM is also a point of investigation.\\n\\nProsecutors are expected to decide whether to include Professor Jung's conspiracy relationship in the indictment when they indict Cho, whose detention period expires today.\\n\\nProfessor Jung is also charged with instructing a securities company employee who managed her assets to replace her home computer hard disk and remove an entire computer from her Dongyang University office (instructing destruction of evidence).\\n\\nGiven the numerous types and contents of charges, prosecutors are also considering calling Professor Jung for questioning at least once more.\\n\\n◇ Weight on prosecutors' plan to seek Jung warrant... Cautious voices also raised\\n\\nAnalysis suggests that prosecutors will seek an arrest warrant after questioning Professor Jung.\\n\\nGiven that prosecutors view Professor Jung as central to various suspicions and have conducted massive investigations while confronting the Blue House and ruling party, it would be realistically difficult to choose non-detention indictment.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, the result of Professor Jung's disposition is observed to become the 'watershed' of this investigation. It is also expected to cause major repercussions for the political situation, including Minister Cho's fate.\\n\\nFor this reason, attention focuses on whether prosecutors will seek a warrant and the court's judgment. If the court, which is not directly related to controversies surrounding the Cho family investigation, recognizes grounds for Professor Jung's arrest and issues a warrant, prosecutors are expected to significantly reduce their burden regarding criticism related to 'forced investigation.'\\n\\nConversely, cautious voices are reportedly being raised given that if the warrant is rejected, prosecutors are likely to face unbearable backlash.\\n\\nIf the warrant is rejected, this investigation will inevitably face criticism as excessive investigation aimed at 'blocking prosecutorial reform.' Calls for accountability regarding Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl are expected to intensify, with questions about his fate likely to arise.\\n\\nProsecutors are also contemplating directly summoning Minister Cho to investigate whether he was involved in various suspicions as soon as they complete their investigation of Professor Jung.\\n\\nHowever, as prolonged investigation could intensify political controversy and factional confrontation while reducing investigative momentum, there are predictions that prosecutors will conclude their investigation within this month.\\n\\nsj9974@yna.co.kr\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>\\n2019/10/03 10:17 transmission\\nOctober 3, 2019, 10:17 AM transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4421, "output_tokens": 1680, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

A considerable number of parents are also refusing to pay second semester tuition fees.\\n\\nParents demanded that the education office dismiss Ilkwang Academy board members (cancel executive appointment approvals) and dispatch interim board members.\\n\\nThe education office conducted an audit in May after receiving a complaint that Ilkwang Academy was trying to force Uchon Elementary's science lab coordinator to perform other duties against their will. When reports were received during the audit that the academy was trying to pursue a 'Smart School Environment Construction Project' worth approximately 2.4 billion won [approximately $1.8 million USD] despite the school's opposition, the education office conducted a total of 4 audits from May to August.\\n\\nThe audit results revealed circumstances showing that Ilkwang Academy improperly interfered in Uchon Elementary's academic operations through pursuing the Smart School project. In particular, the education office explained that circumstances emerged showing the academy selected a specific company as the Smart School project contractor despite procedural flaws serious enough to significantly violate public interest and fairness.\\n\\nThe education office also views the Smart School project cost of nearly 2.4 billion won [approximately $1.8 million USD] as excessive.\\n\\nFor example, Uchon Elementary allocated 150 million won [approximately $113,000 USD] for developing 3 volumes of English learning materials as part of the Smart School project, which is deemed unnecessary spending considering that many English textbooks already exist in the market.\\n\\nThe education office plans to soon request a police investigation into the process of pursuing Uchon Elementary's Smart School project.\\n\\nAfter the education office audit, Ilkwang Academy imposed dismissal or suspension disciplinary actions on 6 staff members including Uchon Elementary's principal. The education office stated that the disciplined staff were whistleblowers who reported on the Smart School project, demanded the academy cancel the disciplinary actions, and also launched a special audit.\\n\\nUchon Elementary parents argue that Ilkwang Academy pursued the Smart School project using tuition fees paid by parents without explaining the project details or obtaining consent.\\n\\nThey also raise suspicions that the staff were disciplined because they reported problems with the Smart School project to the education office and media.\\n\\nChairman Lee Kyu-tae was indicted in 2009 on charges of inflating delivery prices to secure profits when the Air Force introduced electronic warfare training equipment, but was acquitted by the Supreme Court last year.\\n\\nHowever, he was found guilty of bribery, tax evasion, and embezzling funds and educational expenses from Ilkwang Gongyeong, affiliates, and Uchon Elementary, receiving a sentence of 3 years and 10 months imprisonment plus a fine of 1.4 billion won [approximately $1 million USD] and served time.\\n\\nChairman Lee Kyu-tae stepped down as Ilkwang Academy board chairman in 2009, and his son currently serves as board chairman.\\n\\nIlkwang Academy sent a statement to media that afternoon, arguing that existing media reports were 'false facts,' stating that 'the contracting party for the Smart School project was the school principal, who also received advice from the school management committee and reported to the parent assembly.'\\n\\nRegarding the unjust disciplinary allegations, they claimed that 'in the case of the principal, he illegally hired 30 people by deceiving even the education office without reporting to the corporation, despite having no authority to hire staff,' and that 'the academic affairs director and others committed wrongs by allowing reporters to enter the school during class time to help the principal and others, and by inciting parents as if the media reports were factual.'\\n\\nThe academy stated, 'If illegal acts continue that disrupt academic administration through rallies and tuition payment refusals, we will file complaints and accusations against the ringleaders with judicial authorities.'\\n\\njylee24@yna.co.kr\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction and redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>\\n2019/10/02 18:58 transmission\\nOctober 2, 2019 18:58 transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3398, "output_tokens": 1265, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

systems.\\n\\nUniversities are showing resistance to the Ministry of Education's announcement that it will investigate the holistic admissions processes of 13 universities that have high holistic admission ratios and admit many graduates from special purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools.\\n\\nAn admissions office official at University A, which is included in the investigation, expressed frustration, saying, \\\"Early admissions have begun and we need to announce first-round document screening results by mid-October, so we were already working overtime every day, but now it seems our work will be paralyzed.\\\"\\n\\nAn official at University B criticized, saying, \\\"They call it an investigation, but from the university's perspective, it's no different from an audit,\\\" and \\\"Holistic admissions is a qualitative evaluation where admissions officers make professional judgments, so if they say there are problems with that, I question whether the evidence will be objective.\\\"\\n\\nA Korean Council for University Education official said, \\\"While holistic admissions is a system for excellent universities to select talent that fits their schools, from the perspective of mid-to-lower tier universities, it also has the effect of securing students first,\\\" adding, \\\"We're concerned that this unprecedented holistic admissions audit (investigation) might shrink this year's early admissions.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, one university official offered a different perspective, saying, \\\"In the United States, admissions officers are

previous day of the possibility of partially or completely abolishing extracurricular areas of student records.\\n\\nA high school teacher in Seoul expressed concern, saying, \\\"If extracurriculars are abolished from student records, holistic admissions would essentially become academic record-based admissions focused on school records [GPA], which means students would give up on top-tier universities even if they just fail their first-year, first-semester midterm exams,\\\" and \\\"Students would be driven into infinite competition over school records [GPA] and hagwon dependency would increase, devastating high school sites.\\\"\\n\\nAnother teacher argued, \\\"Even if extracurriculars are abolished, they say holistic admissions would still be possible through 'detailed achievement records' (seteuk) that teachers write, but performance assessments and discussion classes are important for seteuk,\\\" and \\\"The reality is that performance assessments get help from parents or hagwons, and discussion is also advantageous for children who have been trained through hagwon education from a young age, so whatever is changed in student records, other side effects will emerge.\\\"\\n\\nA Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations official criticized, saying, \\\"Last year we even conducted a policy deliberation system to create a plan that would maintain the meaning of holistic admissions starting from the 2022 academic year, but they're shaking up the system without even trying it once,\\\" and \\\"This will only add to confusion at education sites.\\\"\\n\\nJeon Gyeong-won, director of the True Education Research Institute at the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU, a left-leaning teachers' organization), also pointed out that \\\"if all extracurriculars such as 'jadongbongjin' (autonomous activities, club activities, volunteer activities, career activities) are abolished, the original purpose of introducing holistic admissions would be undermined.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Jeon stated, \\\"For example, volunteer activities are criticized for having qualitative differences according to social class, but if we abolish them entirely, we give up the educational value of gaining awareness about living together through service,\\\" and \\\"Rather than unconditionally abolishing them, we should present alternatives for a fair system, such as changing to a pass/fail system.\\\"\\n\\n[Produced by Jang Hyun-kyung] Illustration\\n\\nConcerns are also raised that the investigation will proceed hastily considering the vast amount of data, given that the Ministry of Education plans to complete investigations not only of the 13 universities' holistic admissions but also of overall university entrance processes by the end of October.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education explained, \\\"We will receive all admissions data from the past four years, but we're receiving secondary data such as acceptance rates by high school and region.\\\"\\n\\nWhile this investigation began due to growing public anger over a privileged few using connections to enter universities, some point out that it is not actually investigating whether there are cases of privileged children gaining fraudulent admission.\\n\\nWhen reporters asked the previous day whether they would examine individual applicant data to confirm privileged class corruption, Vice Education Minister Park Baek-beom denied this, saying, \\\"Admissions data doesn't include parental occupations,\\\" and \\\"We can't tell if they're children of high-ranking officials, National Assembly members, or wealthy people.\\\"\\n\\nOne education sector official commented, \\\"The root cause of university admission problems lies in the social structure where universities are hierarchically ranked and quality jobs are limited to certain sectors like large corporations, public enterprises, and civil service,\\\" and \\\"Trying to solve this by slightly fixing student records and early admission systems is like trying to cure cancer with stomach medicine.\\\"\\n\\nhyo@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News,

leaking exam questions and answers to her twin daughters, mobilized testimony from hagwon instructors and former students to refute the guilty verdict logic.\\n\\nAt the appellate court hearing held on the 18th at the Seoul Central District Court Criminal Appeals Division 2 (Presiding Judge Lee Kwan-yong), the defense attorney for former academic affairs director Ms. Hyun questioned witness hagwon teacher Mr. Park about Ms. Hyun's daughter's academic abilities.\\n\\nMr. Park, who taught mathematics to Ms. Hyun's daughter in the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] hagwon district, compared schools in Gangnam's School District 8, saying \\\"For example, Whimoon High, Joongdong High, Dankook University Affiliated High, and Eunkwang Girls' High have extremely difficult (school record exams),\\\" adding \\\"In Sookmyung Girls' High School's case, they coach students saying 'this is how questions come out, so just train on this.'\\\"\\n\\nThis means that compared to surrounding Gangnam schools, Sookmyung tends to give ordinary problems faithful to the curriculum, making them relatively easy to solve.\\n\\nWhen the defense attorney asked \\\"Is it possible for students at Sookmyung Girls' High School to score 100 points if they prepare well for school record exams, even if they're not at the top level in hagwons?\\\" Mr. Park answered \\\"I think it's possible.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding Ms. Hyun's daughter, he said \\\"I think the reason her grades improved was diligence,\\\" adding \\\"Based on judging the child's condition through review tests and such, I had expectations that she could reach the level of scoring 100 points.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Park also refuted the first trial's basis for determining that Ms. Hyun's daughter's grades were not based on 'ability.'\\n\\nRegarding the fact that while her school grades rose sharply, her hagwon level test results only improved from Level 4 to Level 3, Mr. Park explained \\\"At that time, Level 3 included both students ranking in the top 5 school-wide and students ranking over 100th.\\\"\\n\\nHe added \\\"Level tests have very different question formats from school record exams, so they don't correlate with school grades,\\\" explaining \\\"It's both funny and sad, but there are students who get private tutoring to do well on hagwon level tests.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding Ms. Hyun's daughter's school exam problems, which received criticism in the first trial for having inadequate solution processes, Mr. Park testified that they were \\\"problems embarrassing to write solutions for\\\" or showed \\\"a student who understands the solutions.\\\"\\n\\nA former student of Ms. Hyun, now a college student, also attended court that day to testify.\\n\\nWhen the defense attorney asked \\\"Did the student who ranked first school-wide in first year continue to rank first?\\\" this former student said \\\"At Sookmyung Girls' High School, absolutely not.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding Ms. Hyun's two daughters' previous rankings of 59th and 121st school-wide before they rose to first place, the student said \\\"At that level, they would be evaluated as good students among their peers.\\\"\\n\\nThe former student also testified about having experience writing their answers in small letters in the corner of exam papers during school, saying \\\"When answers were confusing, I was trying to check the overall answer distribution across all questions.\\\" The student also testified that this was a \\\"common exam skill\\\" taught by hagwon and school teachers.\\n\\nThis is identical to the explanation given by Ms. Hyun's two daughters during the first trial process.\\n\\nThis former student, who served as class president in a class Ms. Hyun once taught, defended their former teacher, saying \\\"When I encountered this incident, I thought 'that can't be true,'\\\" adding \\\"Not just me, but many classmates think the same way.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Hyun watched her former student answer the

Fierce pro-and-con debates are expected to unfold.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced on the 14th that it plans to conduct online and telephone surveys asking 22,500 citizens about their stance on the hagwon Sunday holiday system immediately after the Chuseok holiday ends.\\n\\nThe education office plans to compose about half of the survey subjects as students, viewing what students think about the hagwon Sunday holiday system as most important.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education selected the hagwon Sunday holiday system as its second public debate topic following school uniforms, and has been proceeding with procedures including forming a public debate promotion committee last month with Myongji University Professor Lim Seung-bin as chairman. The survey is also part of the public debate process.\\n\\nThe promotion committee is currently discussing with an advisory group composed of parents, school teachers, hagwon officials, student rights experts, and others how to structure a citizen participation group that will recommend to the superintendent whether to introduce the hagwon Sunday holiday system and implementation plans if introduction is decided.\\n\\nThe citizen participation group's composition and scale has been set as '200 people including students, parents, school teachers, and general citizens,' but the 'composition ratio' is undetermined. Issues reportedly include what proportion should be students and whether to include elementary school students and hagwon officials.\\n\\nThe participation group plans to hold two rounds of 7-hour discussions on October 26th and November 9th, then present recommendations at the end of November. Separately from the participation group, discussion sessions involving stakeholders will also be held on the 27th of this month and the 22nd of next month.\\n\\nIn Gyeonggi [Province], Provincial Assemblyman Chu Min-kyu is preparing an ordinance for the hagwon Sunday holiday system.\\n\\nAssemblyman Chu plans to request opinions from stakeholders such as hagwon associations immediately after the Chuseok holiday, go through necessary procedures including briefings and public hearings, then propose the ordinance around the end of October.\\n\\nThose supporting the hagwon Sunday holiday system emphasize that students need rest.\\n\\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education commissioned research to examine the feasibility of introducing the hagwon Sunday holiday system in June, stating that \\\"the burden on students and parents continues to increase due to excessive hagwon education and entrance exam competition\\\" and \\\"the necessity of introducing the hagwon Sunday holiday system is raised in terms of improving students' physical and mental health and reducing hagwon education costs.\\\"\\n\\nThose opposing introduction of the hagwon Sunday holiday system cite as problematic that it would deprive students of opportunities to supplement at hagwons what they haven't fully mastered through school studies alone.\\n\\nRestricting and infringing upon students' and parents' educational choice and hagwons' freedom of business operation is also a major basis for opposing introduction of the hagwon Sunday holiday system.\\n\\nQuestions are also raised about whether it's an effective measure.\\n\\nAs of April 1st last year, there were 7,791 entrance exam preparation and supplementary education hagwons in Seoul. This is about 1,400 more than the number of karaoke rooms (6,345) in Seoul, meaning that prohibiting and monitoring hagwons' Sunday operations would require 'enormous' administrative power. However, even hagwons' late-night instruction is not properly regulated due to education office staff shortages.\\n\\nThere are also criticisms that students can't rest not because of hagwons.\\n\\nIn last year's Korea Youth Policy Institute survey on children and youth human rights conditions, 52.4% of youth said they lacked sleep, with home study cited as the top reason (first priority) for insufficient sleep, followed by 'hagwons and private tutoring' (18.4%).\\n\\nA considerable number of youth also cited chatting and text messaging (14.1%) or internet use (13.0%) as reasons, making it difficult to say hagwons alone are the reason for sleep deprivation.\\n\\nStudents studying at a hagwon. [Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nHow to implement the hagwon Sunday holiday system is also controversial.\\n\\nSuperintendent Cho Hee-yeon plans to first request the Ministry of Education to revise the 'Act on the Establishment and Operation of Hagwons and Extracurricular Lessons' if public opinion converges toward introducing the hagwon Sunday holiday system.\\n\\nHowever, the Ministry of Education is reportedly not planning to actively pursue introduction of the hagwon Sunday holiday system.\\n\\nSuperintendent Cho is thinking of enacting an ordinance to implement the hagwon Sunday holiday system in Seoul alone if the Ministry of Education doesn't accept the recommendation.\\n\\nHowever, implementing the hagwon Sunday holiday system through ordinance could spark constitutional and legal controversies.\\n\\nThe Korea Legislation Research Institute issued an authoritative interpretation in 2017 that it's impossible under hagwon law for superintendents to designate hagwon closure days through ordinances.

Despite failing twice, Ms. Cho received scholarships totaling 12 million won [approximately $9,000 USD] for 6 consecutive semesters from 2016 to 2018.\\n\\nThe scholarship was provided by the 'Socheon Scholarship Foundation,' privately established by Noh Hwan-jung, director of Busan Medical Center, who was her supervising professor. While this scholarship was given to at least 2 people each semester, Ms. Cho alone received it for 6 semesters.\\n\\nThe fact that nominee Cho met and dined with Director Noh and hospital officials just before the scholarship was received, that Director Noh was selected as director of Busan Medical Center when nominee Cho was senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, and that documents stating he 'was deeply involved in selecting the president's personal physician' were reportedly found on Director Noh's office computer during the prosecution's search and seizure, are expected to become material for opposition attacks.\\n\\nHowever, nominee Cho refuted, saying \\\"As announced by Pusan National University Graduate School of Medicine, there was nothing illegal about the payment\\\" and \\\"The selection of the Busan Medical Center director and personal physician is not within the authority of the senior secretary for civil affairs.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that Ms. Cho received scholarships totaling 8.04 million won [approximately $6,000 USD] for 2 semesters after entering Seoul National University Graduate School of Environmental Studies in 2014 also became problematic, with questions of whether it was 'eating and running' since she took a leave of absence immediately after being accepted to medical school in October of that year.\\n\\nMoreover, this scholarship from the 'Gwanak Association,' a scholarship foundation under the Seoul National University Alumni Association, was reportedly given even though Ms. Cho had not applied for it, causing fierce controversy over the circumstances.\\n\\nNominee Cho said, \\\"No one in our family has ever applied for or contacted by phone about Seoul National University alumni scholarships\\\" and \\\"We tried to return the scholarship when taking a leave of absence, but the scholarship foundation said it was impossible.\\\"\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Jung-hoon = Justice Minister nominee Cho Kuk arrives at the confirmation hearing preparation team office at Jeokseon Hyundai Building in Jongro-gu, Seoul, on the morning of the 4th. uwg806@yna.co.kr\\n\\n◇ Private equity fund suspicions...Family fund and government contract allegations\\n\\nThe private equity fund 'Blue Core Value-up No. 1' by Kolink Private Equity (PE), which nominee Cho's spouse and children invested in in July 2017, is also a core issue of the hearing.\\n\\nThis private equity fund had a total of 6 investors, with nominee Cho's spouse and two children investing 1.05 billion won [approximately $788,000 USD], and his spouse's brother (nominee Cho's brother-in-law) and two sons investing 350 million won [approximately $263,000 USD].\\n\\nAdditionally, circumstances became known that in March 2017, his spouse lent 300 million won [approximately $225,000 USD] to her brother, and the brother purchased Kolink PE shares at 200 times the price, raising suspicions that the private equity fund was essentially a 'family fund' and a means to avoid gift taxes.\\n\\nSuspicions have also been raised that the actual owner of Kolink PE is nominee Cho's second cousin. Nominee Cho has explained that he was introduced to the fund by his second cousin.\\n\\nRegarding this, nominee Cho said, \\\"I didn't know well what a private equity fund was\\\" and \\\"I hope my second cousin returns to the country as soon as possible to reveal the truth.\\\"\\n\\nThis private equity fund invested in streetlight flasher company 'Wells C&T' in August 2017, and it was pointed out as suspicious that Wells C&T subsequently won 177 projects from 47 local governments and public institutions, with sales nearly doubling.\\n\\nAs the private equity fund investment was made after nominee Cho was appointed as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, the Liberty Korea Party claims this company received preferential treatment.\\n\\nThe fact that 2 months after nominee Cho's family invested in Kolink PE, related company Consortium A was selected as the 'preferred bidder' for Seoul's 150 billion won [approximately $113 million USD] subway Wi-Fi project is also a point where the opposition raises suspicions.\\n\\nThe Liberty Korea Party suspects that Consortium A won the public bid through the influence or inside information of nominee Cho and other ruling party members, given that two former aides to former and current Democratic Party lawmakers are listed as major shareholders of Consortium A.\\n\\nAdditionally, suspicions arose that Kolink PE's acquisition of shares in KOSDAQ-listed secondary battery company WFM in October 2017, becoming the largest shareholder, was an attempt at backdoor listing for Wells C&T. If this were the case, Blue Core Value-up No. 1, which invested in Wells C&T—that is, nominee Cho's fund—would gain considerable profit.\\n\\nHowever, nominee Cho refuted, \\\"I didn't know about Kolink PE itself until recently.\\\" He added, \\\"I have never been involved in winning government contracts at all.\\\"\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Kim Ju-hyung = Justice Minister nominee Cho Kuk answers reporters' questions at a press conference that resumed after finishing dinner at the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 2nd. kjhpress@yna.co.kr\\n\\n◇ Ungdong hagwon suspicions...'Sham lawsuit and property seizure' controversy\\n\\nSuspicions surrounding the school corporation Ungdong hagwon, which has been operated by nominee Cho's family, are also receiving considerable attention as they are directly related to nominee Cho's family's current property issues.\\n\\nNominee Cho's mother and younger brother Cho Kwon previously applied for 'qualified acceptance'—not repaying debts exceeding inherited property—to avoid joint debt obligations when Goryeo General Construction, where their father served as representative director, went bankrupt in 1997, thereby escaping debt.\\n\\nLater, Cho Kwon established a company called Cova C&D in late 2005, then transferred construction payment claims (approximately 5.2 billion won [approximately $3.9 million USD] at the time) that he couldn't receive from Ungdong hagwon, where his father served as chairman—1 billion won [approximately $750,000 USD] to his spouse and 4.2 billion won [approximately $3.2 million USD] to Cova C&D—then filed a lawsuit against Ungdong hagwon for construction costs.\\n\\nHowever, Ungdong hagwon gave up on defense, and Cho Kwon's side won the case, raising suspicions of a 'sham lawsuit.'\\n\\nThe same lawsuit occurred in 2017 as well. When the statute of limitations for the case was about to expire, 'Cafe Hugo,' represented by Ms. Cho, the ex-wife of Cho Kwon, filed a lawsuit against Ungdong hagwon and again won without defense. This was after they had divorced.\\n\\nCriticism arose that nominee Cho's family did not repay their father's 4.2 billion won [approximately $3.2 million USD] debt but acquired 5.1 billion won [approximately $3.8 million USD] in claims.\\n\\nThe Liberty Korea Party claims, \\\"The original construction cost was 1.6 billion won [approximately $1.2 million USD], but now it has grown to 10.084 billion won [approximately $7.6 million USD] (including delay interest)\\\" and \\\"The lawsuit was filed with the purpose of seizing school property if Ungdong hagwon closes.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, nominee Cho explained, \\\"My brother came to have construction payment claims for the school, but nothing remained. We never took measures such as provisional seizure against the school, and (the lawsuit) was a measure to confirm claims.\\\"\\n\\nNominee Cho himself also caused controversy by reportedly avoiding his father's 1.2 billion won [approximately $900,000 USD] debt to Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO) for just 6 won [approximately $0.005 USD] through qualified acceptance along with his brother.\\n\\nThe Liberty Korea Party believes that the funds nominee Cho used to purchase Daelim Apartment in Garak-dong, Songpa-gu in 1998 and Kyungnam Sunkyung Apartment in Haeundae-gu, Busan in 1999 also flowed from Ungdong hagwon.\\n\\nbanghd@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo <Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited> Sent 2019/09/04 17:17 Sent September 4, 2019 5:17 PM\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 6665, "output_tokens": 3382, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

We improved 452 unnecessary or duplicative projects so that school teachers could concentrate on classes and student guidance while staying close to students.\\n\\nLast July, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Provisional Government, I traveled the independence movement route from Imcheong-gak to Harbin with 55 teachers and high school students. Through this independence movement pilgrimage, we sought to learn the spirit of patriotism and inherit the noble spirit of the March 1st Movement, but I have much regret that many students could not participate due to circumstances.\\n\\n-- What are the educational measures for students in small rural and fishing village schools?\\n\\n▲ In preparation for the decline in school-age population, we implemented various policies such as joint educational curricula for small rural and fishing village schools, distinctive educational curricula by school, free school district system for small schools, and certification system for reviving small schools.\\n\\nIn particular, we piloted the 'free school district system for small schools' in 29 elementary schools this year, adjusting school districts so that students from large schools can transfer to small schools without relocating their addresses. As a result, 113 students flowed into small schools—76 new students and 37 transfer students—increasing 9 classes and resolving 9 combined classes.\\n\\nNext year, we plan to additionally designate 68 elementary schools and pilot the program in middle schools including 2 private and 9 public schools.\\n\\n-- Parents are very worried about safety due to a recent fire at an elementary school in Andong.\\n\\n▲ When conducting school construction, we require construction to proceed only after supervision and oversight officials are present. For welding work and other operations with high fire risk, we require teams of two and deploy fire monitors. We thoroughly implement a permit system for fire-handling work and seek to eliminate dryvit exterior finishing materials that pose high fire spread risks.\\n\\nWe conducted comprehensive inspections of fire safety plans at each school and took measures to immediately supplement and correct deficiencies. We designated three or more evacuation sites inside and outside schools, allowing evacuation to optimal locations considering fire size, wind direction, and other factors.\\n\\nWe conduct disaster safety education, including fire safety education through curriculum and creative experiential activities, at least 6 hours twice per semester.\\n[Provided by Gyeongbuk Provincial Office of Education. Resale and DB prohibited]\\n\\n-- What are your thoughts on expanding regular admissions and abolishing autonomous private high schools?\\n\\n▲ Expanding regular admissions is a policy that emerged to ensure fairness in college entrance exams, but expanding regular admissions could create unfairness favoring students in urban areas with good hagwon education infrastructure. Since it conflicts with the direction of future education that must cultivate creative, convergent talent, it would be desirable to minimize the expansion ratio of regular admissions.\\n\\nAutonomous private high schools have had cases of aberrant operation contrary to their original purpose in some regions like the metropolitan area. Autonomous private high schools in the Gyeongbuk region operate distinctive educational curricula and are contributing to nurturing regional talent, achieving perfect scores in constituent satisfaction surveys among this year's re-designation evaluation items. I judge that rather than wholesale abolition due to policy changes, there is a need to carefully consider educational consumer opinions and regional educational conditions from an educational perspective.\\n\\n-- What are your plans for free meals and free education?\\n\\n▲ This year we implemented free meals for all elementary, middle, and special schools, so the current free meal support ratio reaches about 85% of all elementary, middle, and high school students. Next year we plan to provide free meals to high school seniors, in 2021 to high school sophomores and seniors, and in 2022 to all high school students.\\n\\nRegarding free education, starting from the second semester this year, we supported 9 billion won [approximately $6.8 million USD] in tuition and school operation support fees for high school seniors. Next year we will expand the target to high school sophomores and seniors, supporting a total of 51.5 billion won [approximately $39 million USD]. In 2021, we plan to provide free education to all high school students, supporting 74.6 billion won [approximately $56 million USD].\\n[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n-- What are next year's main projects?\\n\\n▲ Next year, we plan to support individualized, customized achievement by introducing an online evaluation system where students challenge themselves through operating the 'Challenge! Academic Achievement Certification System.' We seek to nurture Gyeongbuk people who grow with warm hearts and healthy bodies through operating schools with poetic resonance, proper walking, and other programs.\\n\\nWe will strengthen educational public nature by expanding free education and free meals, and achieve early completion of earthquake-resistant reinforcement construction and asbestos removal construction. We seek to actively promote the free school district system for small schools to create safe school environments and realize educational welfare.\\n\\nWe will continue school operation normalization projects to create schools where teachers can concentrate on classes and student guidance, and seek to create a school self-governance culture where autonomy and responsibility go together.\\n\\nmshan@yna.co.kr\\nReports via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder(c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>2019/12/26 06:10 transmission 2019 December 26 06:10 transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4101, "output_tokens": 1603, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

We received 8.31 points out of 10 (Grade 2) in the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission's public institution integrity evaluation. This is the highest score in 10 years. Regarding election promises made to citizens, we received the highest grade (SA) in the 'National Education Superintendents' Pledge Implementation Plan' hosted by the Korea Manifesto Practice Headquarters. We reduced parents' educational cost burden through support for middle schoolers' first school uniforms, free meals for 10th graders, support for 11th graders' school trip expenses, and free education for 12th graders. Despite these achievements, it's regrettable that we couldn't resolve the educational gap between the eastern and western regions.\\n\\n-- What will change in Busan education in 2020?\\n▲ We're establishing wireless internet environments in all classrooms of 98 elementary, middle, and high schools to pursue instructional innovation using artificial intelligence and EdTech. Starting next year, we'll extend software education funding support, which this year was only provided to elementary schools, to all middle schools. In September 2020, a Global Foreign Language Center will open in the western Busan area to cultivate internationally-minded talent. We'll provide cultural and arts activity funding to all elementary students, and a second Playground Center will open in September at the site of the closed Dongsam Middle School in Yeongdo-gu.

[Yonhap News file photo] March 6, 2019 ccho@yna.co.kr\\n\\n-- What are your measures for the declining school-age population?\\n▲ Busan is the city with the fastest declining school-age population nationwide. We're consolidating small schools, but there are difficulties in this process because many people, including parents, have different opinions. We're trying our best to persuade and reach consensus. We're reviewing plans to repurpose closed school facilities as facilities for resolving educational gaps and future education. We're providing support for multi-child families including priority assignment to desired general high schools for multi-child students, eligibility for free after-school program vouchers, and preferential personnel treatment for teachers with multiple children.\\n\\n-- There's criticism that you're passive in using various education budgets. What's your opinion on the fiscal stabilization fund?\\n▲ I cannot agree with criticism that we're passive in budget use. We've devoted all our energy to securing fiscal soundness and efficient use by expanding budget input where it's absolutely necessary and minimizing unnecessary and urgent budget expenditures as much as possible. Next year, we're investing a lot of budget to resolve educational gaps, including expanding free high school meals. We allocated 392.9 billion won [approximately $295 million USD] for student safety (asbestos replacement, seismic reinforcement, educational environment improvement), an increase of 109.9 billion won [approximately $82 million USD] from the previous year.\\n\\nThe fiscal stabilization fund that became controversial in the city council is a kind of savings system where we accumulate part of the funds when revenue increases and can use them during difficult times like economic recession. We plan to establish detailed usage plans for the fiscal stabilization fund accumulated this year and efficiently execute it for next year's educational projects.\\n\\n(Busan=Yonhap News) Reporter Cho Jung-ho = At the opening ceremony of the AI-based Future Education Center held at Tongmyong University in Busan on the 12th, Tongmyong University President Jeong Hong-seop and Busan Metropolitan Office of Education Superintendent Kim Seok-jun examine the AI education system.

[Yonhap News file photo] February 12, 2019 ccho@yna.co.kr\\n\\n-- What are your measures for sexual problems such as sexual harassment and assault occurring in schools?\\n▲ We're making multifaceted efforts including promoting comprehensive measures to eliminate school sex crimes, but it's regrettable that they haven't been eradicated. Most school sexual violence stems from differences in gender sensitivity between students and school staff as sexual values change. The reality is that school staff still have low gender sensitivity. We're conducting 'Visiting School Staff Gender Sensitivity Enhancement Education' using external organizations for school staff. Since July 2019, we've appointed gender and human rights citizen investigators (around 15 people) to conduct fair investigations at schools where school Me Too incidents occur.\\n\\n-- As a progressive education superintendent, what are your views on frequent college admissions policy changes?\\nThe recently controversial college admissions fairness issue is not about 'expanding regular admissions' or 'reducing comprehensive student record admissions [hakjong].' It stems from social problems related to widespread wage gaps and educational inequality in our society.\\n\\nIf we simply expand regular admissions alone, public education will return to simple rote memorization and dependence on hagwon education will rapidly increase. The 40% expansion of CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]-focused regular admissions hasn't been applied to all universities nationwide yet, but it's expected to have future impact. Particularly, it could intensify educational opportunity imbalances between provinces and Seoul and cause disruption in school education.\\n\\n-- What will you focus on during your remaining term?\\n▲ There's a saying that '20th century teachers are teaching 21st century students in 19th century classrooms.' We need to change our teaching methods and school culture so we can nurture our children's capabilities while looking toward their future. I will steadily prepare and build future education infrastructure for the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.\\n\\nccho@yna.co.kr\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo\\n<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>\\nDecember 26, 2019 06:10 transmission\\nDecember 26, 2019 06:10 transmission\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4514, "output_tokens": 1881, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The Ministry of Education announced on the 28th that it will have 16 Seoul universities increase the number of students selected through CSAT-based regular track to 40% or more by the 2023 academic year. The universities subject to regular track expansion are Konkuk University, Kyung Hee University, Korea University, Kwangwoon University, Dongguk University, Sogang University, University of Seoul, Seoul National University, Seoul Women's University, Sungkyunkwan University, Sookmyung Women's University, Soongsil University, Yonsei University, Chung-Ang University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, and Hanyang University. Among these 16 universities, the 2021 academic year regular track selection comprises 14,787 students, which is 29% of the total 51,013 recruitment slots. If this proportion is raised to 40%, regular track selection will increase by 5,625 students to a total of 24,012.\\n\\nWhile the universities targeted for regular track expansion are 16 Seoul-based institutions, the ripple effect is expected to spread to other universities as well. This is because the Ministry of Education plans to link regular track expansion with the 'High School Education Contribution University Support Project.' This essentially means forcing regular track expansion by using financial support for universities as leverage. Nominally, this support project aims to provide financial assistance to universities that simplify admission processes and enhance fairness and transparency. However, universities designated for regular track expansion must submit plans to the Ministry of Education to achieve a 40% regular track ratio by the 2023 academic year in order to participate in this project. Universities that depend on government financial support have no choice but to accept this 'coercive measure.' Even universities not designated as targets will inevitably have to consider regular track expansion while watching others' moves. This is why the education sector is voicing concerns that if regular track expansion spreads in this manner, problem-solving-oriented classes will revive in school settings, damaging public education normalization.\\n\\nThe measures to strengthen fairness in the comprehensive evaluation system [hakjong] also seem to fall short of resonating with parents and students. The core of this plan is to gradually reduce the reflection of non-curricular areas of school records and personal statements in university admissions, completely abolishing them by the 2024 academic year. However, there is strong criticism that no effective measures are visible to address the fundamental reason for distrust in the comprehensive evaluation system—that the quality of student record writing varies from teacher to teacher. The measures presented by the Ministry of Education to resolve gaps between teachers, such as distributing standard guidelines for student record entries, are said to be insufficient to wash away public distrust that 'you're doomed if you get the wrong teacher.'\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education announced this fairness enhancement plan exactly 100 days after allegations surfaced regarding the university admission of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk's daughter. However, it appears insufficient to gain the sympathy of the majority of citizens. The biggest dysfunction of regular track expansion is the high possibility that side effects of exam-oriented education, such as public education disruption and hagwon education [private tutoring industry] promotion, will be repeated. This is why some in the education sector criticize that 'regular track expansion is an anti-educational declaration of abandoning public education that foreshadows classroom collapse.' The comprehensive evaluation system reform is also facing harsh criticism as being intended to quell public opinion over the 'Cho Kuk incident.' The Ministry of Education should heed these criticisms and not blindly push forward with regular track expansion in a way that would harm the foundation of public education normalization. We also hope for additional supplementary measures for the comprehensive evaluation system reform. In particular, if the Ministry of Education has been focused on short-term measures to ensure fairness until the 2024 university admissions, it should now present substantial measures for high school education normalization from a long-term perspective. The blueprint consists of the 'high school system reorganization' and 'high school credit system' that were announced in the early days of the Moon Jae-in administration with a target of 2025. We hope the Ministry of Education will revise and supplement these two pillars to present a long-term vision for 'future education' aimed at fostering creative talent.\\n\\nTips: KakaoTalk okjebo <Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited> November 28, 2019 1:50 PM transmission November 28, 2019 1:50 PM transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3349, "output_tokens": 1147, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

If only the disadvantage in school records [GPA] is resolved, foreign language high schools, international high schools, and autonomous private high schools would become absolutely advantageous in university admissions. This point led to arguments that these schools should be abolished before implementing the high school credit system.\\n\\n[Photo caption: In 2017, members of the civic education group No More Worry About Private Education hold a rally in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in Jongno-gu, Seoul, advocating for the abolition of autonomous private high schools. [Yonhap News file photo]]\\n\\n◇ Specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools that started as 'supplements' to high school equalization... creating cracks in the spirit of equalization\\n\\nForeign language high schools, international high schools, and autonomous private high schools all emerged as 'supplements' to high school equalization.\\n\\nAround the implementation of high school equalization in 1974, concerns poured out from inside and outside the education community that students' academic abilities would undergo 'downward leveling.' Criticism was also raised that the government had abandoned excellence education, namely 'elite education.'\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop of concerns and criticism, science high schools were established in 1983 and foreign language high schools (then called foreign language schools) in 1984. Science high schools were designated as specialized high schools in 1986, and foreign language high schools in 1992. International high schools were established as specialized high schools in 1998.\\n\\nAutonomous private high schools were first introduced in 2001 under the name 'independent private high schools' during the Kim Dae-jung administration.\\n\\nThe plan to create private high schools that would receive broad autonomy in curriculum organization and operation in exchange for not receiving financial support to expand students' school choice was already presented in the 'Education Reform Plan for Establishing a New Education System' (May 31 Education Reform Plan) announced in 1995 during the Kim Young-sam administration. The May 31 Education Reform Plan is evaluated as the blueprint for the current education system.\\n\\nSpecialized high schools and autonomous private high schools were heated topics of controversy from their inception. These schools are paradoxical entities that serve as supplements to resolve the side effects of high school equalization while simultaneously creating cracks in the spirit of high school equalization, which aimed to ease entrance exam competition and realize holistic education.\\n\\nSpecialized high schools and autonomous private high schools are also cited as main culprits in fueling early hagwon education [hagwon education] fever. They also face criticism for becoming channels through which certain classes who can afford expensive tuition and have the leisure to focus on their children's education pass down their social and economic status.\\n\\nSeoul Metropolitan Superintendent of Education Cho Hee-yeon has even defined the abolition of autonomous private high schools as 'second high school equalization.' This means autonomous private high schools function like the 'prestigious high schools' that required passing difficult exams for admission until the 1970s.\\n\\nAccording to hagwon education [hagwon education] cost statistics released by Statistics Korea last March, as of last year, the hagwon education [hagwon education] participation rates of middle school students seeking to advance to specialized high schools and autonomous high schools including autonomous private high schools were 82.4% and 78.8% respectively, higher than those hoping to advance to regular high schools (69.5%). Average monthly hagwon education [hagwon education] costs were also higher for those hoping to advance to specialized high schools (493,000 won [approximately $370 USD]) and autonomous high schools (425,000 won [approximately $320 USD]) than for regular high school aspirants (296,000 won [approximately $220 USD]).\\n\\nThose advocating for the abolition of specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools also argue that these schools have caused 'devastation' of regular high schools by using their student selection rights to sweep up 'excellent students.'\\n\\nIndeed, comparing Seoul area high schools by type, the ratio of new students whose middle school records [GPA] ranked in the top 10% is 44.4% for 7 foreign language and international high schools, 18.5% for 23 autonomous private high schools, and 8.5% for regular high schools. This confirms the hierarchy of 'foreign language·international high schools > autonomous private high schools > regular high schools.'\\n\\n[Photo caption: Parents of 8 Seoul autonomous private high schools that received scores below re-designation standards in this year's autonomous private high school operational performance evaluation (re-designation evaluation) and face designation cancellation crisis hold a protest rally.

This was the first survey conducted since the admission officer system was introduced in 2007 and developed into Hakjong, 12 years later. The Ministry of Education formed an investigation team to analyze university admission data from 13 universities including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, and Korea University for the 2016-2019 academic years - universities with high Hakjong selection ratios or many admissions from specific high schools. This survey has drawn extraordinary attention as it emerged during the government's process of promoting expanded regular admissions plans.\\n\\nThe most notable finding in the fact-finding survey is the entrenchment of hierarchical structures by high school type. Looking at acceptance rates by high school type, science and gifted high schools had the highest rate at 26.1%, followed by foreign language and international high schools at 13.9%, private high schools at 10.2%, and general high schools at 9.1%. The Hakjong acceptance rate for science and gifted high schools was nearly three times higher than that of general high schools. By high school location, Seoul students had much higher Hakjong selection ratios than provincial students. It was also revealed that some high schools improperly provided universities with past graduates' university admission records or students' language test scores. However, the so-called high school ranking system - where schools are graded to evaluate students - was not confirmed in this survey, leading to suggestions that additional investigation is needed. There were also 366 violations involving content in personal statements and recommendation letters that revealed parents' socioeconomic status, and 228 personal statements suspected of plagiarism. In special talent admissions, cases were confirmed where language abilities were set as qualification and evaluation criteria, resulting in students from specific high schools comprising 70% of successful candidates in some departments.\\n\\nWhile the fact-finding survey revealed various problems with Hakjong, this is not grounds for blindly pushing through expanded regular admissions. If regular admissions are rashly expanded under the pretext of university admission fairness, it will drive high school curricula into dysfunction and undermine the normalization of public education. There is a high possibility that the side effects of exam-focused education that we painfully experienced in the past will be repeated. The biggest dysfunction of expanding regular admissions is that it promotes hagwon education, leading to educational inequality. It is widely known that regular admissions is a system favorable to children from high-income families. There are survey results from various education-related institutions showing that income and scores are proportional when comparing monthly average household income with test-takers' CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] average scores. This is why the Korea Educational Development Institute's '2018 Education Public Opinion Survey' showed that high-income earners with monthly incomes of 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] or more overwhelmingly prefer CSAT-focused regular admissions. There are great concerns in school settings that problem-solving classes will increase instead of presentation and discussion. Future education aimed at nurturing creative talent will be pushed to the back burner.\\n\\nUniversity admission systems involve different perspectives and complexly intertwined interests among students, parents, teachers, as well as various education-related organizations and institutions. It is not something to be handled rashly. In particular, frequent changes could shake education from its very foundation. Recently, over 1,400 people from various sectors issued a declaration stating, 'It is deeply regrettable and concerning to attempt to solve Korea's educational problems that unexpectedly emerged from the Cho Kuk incident through CSAT-focused regular admission expansion.' The Council of Superintendents of Education also issued a statement calling for the immediate cessation of regular admission expansion. The Ministry of Education should listen to these critical voices. We hope that the 'University Admission Fairness Enhancement Plan' to be announced this month will present regular admission expansion ratios and Hakjong improvement measures that the majority of citizens can support.\\n\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright(c) Yonhap News, Unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>2019/11/05 15:30 Transmission November 5, 2019, 3:30 PM Transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3285, "output_tokens": 1047, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

presidential advisory body, argued that essay and descriptive questions should be introduced to the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) and school autonomy should be strengthened to secure 'future education' and educational fairness.\\n\\nChairman Kim made this argument in a keynote speech at the 'Korea-OECD International Education Conference' jointly hosted by 11 organizations including the National Education Council, Ministry of Education, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the 23rd.\\n\\nIn his speech titled 'Directions and Key Agendas for Establishing the 2030 Future Education System,' Chairman Kim emphasized that academic ability should be redefined as 'ability to live' in accordance with the future intelligent information society, and the education system should be redesigned accordingly.\\n\\nHe said, \\\"'Internal fairness' in education means providing equal opportunities to develop capabilities to prepare for the future and ensuring that the state takes responsibility for guaranteeing the minimum capabilities needed to maintain a human-like life,\\\" adding, \\\"We must strengthen this fairness to alleviate and resolve conflicts surrounding education.\\\"\\n\\nHe continued, \\\"Educational problems in our society, particularly controversies over university admissions processes, are close to interest disputes that judge whether the rules of the game for status acquisition are advantageous or disadvantageous, and this is an issue of 'external fairness' in education,\\\" pointing out that \\\"fairness disputes related to mobilizing 'forces outside school' such as parents or hagwon education are matters of interest coordination, so there are no short-term solutions.\\\"\\n\\nAs a mid- to long-term solution to resolve interest disputes over external fairness in education, Chairman Kim proposed introducing essay and descriptive questions that measure future capabilities to the CSAT and strengthening school community autonomy.\\n\\nHe explained, \\\"If essay and descriptive questions that can gauge students' future capabilities are introduced and the reliability of the CSAT increases, a natural balance will be formed in the selection methods chosen by some universities,\\\" adding, \\\"If parents and residents can look into schools, controversies over fairness regarding the comprehensive school record admission system will also be alleviated.\\\"\\n\\nChairman Kim also proposed adjusting the educational period for elementary, middle, and high schools, establishing a 'career exploration year' at ages 14-15, and creating new teacher training systems such as teacher professional graduate schools.\\n\\nAndreas Schleicher, OECD Education Director, followed Chairman Kim with a speech titled 'Analysis of Korean Education from the OECD Education 2030 Learning Framework.'\\n\\nDirector Schleicher noted that Korean students have low life satisfaction compared to their academic achievement and suggested, \\\"The criteria for student success should be redefined from academic achievement to improving 'quality of life.'\\\"\\n\\nHe first revealed the contents of the 'OECD Physical Education International Comparative Analysis Report' on this day.\\n\\nAccording to this report, Korea has the third-highest school physical education class hours among 18 countries and regions worldwide, after Turkey and Chile, but relatively many students reported having no physical activity outside school, with large gender gaps.\\n\\nDeputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Yoo Eun-hye said in her opening remarks before the keynote speech, \\\"While there are certainly points to overcome, such as excessive entrance exam competition, no one can deny that education has been the driving force of national development,\\\" adding, \\\"As the flow of change such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought challenges and crises to the education system, we must gather wisdom to turn these into opportunities.\\\"\\n\\nThe Korea-OECD International Education Conference continues for three days

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n(Sejong·Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporters Lee Hyo-seok and Lee Jae-young = The education community has responded to the government's plan to convert autonomous private high schools (jasago), foreign language high schools, and international high schools all at once into regular high schools in March 2025, calling it \\\"an expected course of action.\\\" However, opinions were divided by organization.\\n\\nAccording to the Democratic Party of Korea on the 14th, the Ministry of Education discussed plans to collectively convert jasago, foreign language high schools, and international high schools into regular high schools in 2025 at a ruling party-government-Blue House consultation meeting on the 18th of last month. The Ministry of Education said it would revise the Elementary and Secondary Education Act enforcement decree at the end of this year or early next year for the mass conversion.\\n\\nThe government is citing the full introduction of the high school credit system in the 2025 school year as justification for the need for mass conversion. The high school credit system, where students choose classes they want to take, must be implemented together with 'absolute evaluation of high school records' (achievement evaluation), and if absolute evaluation of school records is implemented, jasago and similar schools are likely to gain a very advantageous position over regular high schools in university admissions.\\n\\nLee Man-gi, director of the Uway Education Evaluation Research Institute and university admissions expert, explained, \\\"To introduce the high school credit system, absolute evaluation of high school records must be implemented,\\\" adding \\\"With absolute evaluation of school records, jasago and similar schools would become greatly advantageous, so the credit system cannot be introduced without eliminating jasago and similar schools.\\\"\\n\\nProgressive-leaning superintendents and education organizations have consistently argued for revising laws to convert jasago and similar schools to regular high schools all at once.\\n\\nEspecially as major confusion arose during this year's re-designation evaluation (operational performance evaluation), voices calling for mass conversion have grown louder to prevent such confusion from recurring.\\n\\nJeon Kyung-won, director of the Chamgyoyuk [True Education] Research Institute at KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization), said, \\\"The government has set the right direction for now,\\\" explaining \\\"If jasago and similar schools are not converted to regular high schools before the full introduction of the credit system, the situation would become unmanageable later.\\\"\\n\\nHe analyzed, \\\"I understand that as applicants decrease, voices saying it's difficult are emerging from within jasago as well,\\\" adding \\\"(The government plan) aligns with the current trend of jasago wanting to convert to regular high schools due to financial problems and other issues.\\\"\\n\\nKoo Bon-chang, policy director at Saegyoyukgeokjeongeomneunsegsang [World Without Worry About Private Education], said, \\\"The government plan is reasonable in that it set a 'grace period' to convert to regular high schools in 2025 after revising laws at the end of this year or early next year,\\\" adding \\\"I evaluate this as a plan moving toward 'upward equalization' where each regular high school operates diverse curricula through the credit system, rather than 'educational diversification' through the high school system.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, Cho Seong-cheol, spokesperson for the Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations (KFTA), pointed out, \\\"Before converting jasago and similar schools to regular high schools, there needs to be proof that regular high schools can also provide diverse education suited to students' talents and aptitudes,\\\" adding \\\"If they had said they would convert jasago and similar schools to regular high schools after gaining trust that regular high schools can also provide diverse education, no one would have opposed it.\\\"\\n\\nHe argued, \\\"There are concerns from the education field that even if the credit system is implemented, it will remain at the level of slightly increasing elective subjects because it's difficult to realize a credit system at the high school level where students choose all classes like at universities,\\\" adding \\\"It's unreasonable to eliminate schools that already operate diverse curricula when it's unclear at what level the credit system will operate (just because the credit system is being implemented).\\\"\\n\\nSpokesperson Cho added, \\\"The high school system shouldn't change just because the administration changes,\\\" saying \\\"The high school system should be designed in a direction that can provide diverse curricula to students and cultivate talent suitable for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and this should be specified in law.\\\"\\n\\nThe government's plan for mass conversion of jasago, foreign language high schools, and international high schools is expected to affect the popularity of jasago and similar schools starting from this year's high school

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\n(Sejong=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Hyo-seok = As President Moon Jae-in identified high school hierarchies and university admission fairness issues as 'systems that harm equal opportunity,' 'fairness' has been thrown to the Ministry of Education as a hot topic.\\n\\nAs the Ministry of Education begins full-scale reform of the university admission system, voices in the education sector argue that rather than focusing only on formal fairness in university admissions, fairness should be granted from an educational perspective.\\n\\nOn the 12th, Professor Kim Jae-woong of Sogang University's Education Department, Professor Kang Tae-jung of Chung-Ang University's Education Department, and Professor Park Sang-wan of Busan National University of Education's Education Department pointed out in their paper 'Discussion on the Meaning of University Admission Fairness from an Educational Perspective' published in the quarterly journal 'Korean Education' Issue 46 by the Korean Educational Development Institute that \\\"university admission system discussions so far have only focused on competitors for major universities, while not considering students who cannot attend university for various reasons or students whose grades are 'lowered' for higher rankings.\\\"\\n\\nThe research team presented the problem awareness that \\\"university admission fairness discourse has been biased toward political and social perspectives, with insufficient discussion from an 'educational perspective,'\\\" and that admission fairness should be examined from the perspective of 'how to distribute university education opportunities justly' considering 'all students' right to education and right not to be discriminated against or excluded from provided education.'\\n\\nA scene from the 'Jongno Academy 2020 University Admission Rolling Admissions Strategy Briefing' held on July 21st at Seoul Jinseon Girls' High School auditorium [Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nIn this regard, the research team surveyed a total of 240 people including 178 high school teachers and 62 admissions officers, and conducted Focus Group Interviews (FGI) with 13 experts including 5 high school teachers, 3 admissions directors, 2 faculty admissions officers, 2 professors, and 1 admissions officer.\\n\\nThe survey results showed that both teachers and admissions officers answered that considering both 'CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) scores' and 'applicants' background factors' together would create a fairer admission process.\\n\\nResponses such as 'it is fair to use CSAT scores as a standard within each category by distinguishing region, gender, school type, etc.' and 'score standards should be lowered for applicants with disadvantageous home and school environments' were more prevalent than responses saying 'only CSAT scores should be used.'\\n\\nRegarding the survey results, the research team emphasized that \\\"there are more positions that find fairness in progressive consideration to check structural opportunity inequality rather than in score-based uniformity (equity),\\\" and \\\"this means that distribution based on 'ability' is not the golden rule of fairness, and educational opportunity distribution should maximally consider disadvantaged groups.\\\"\\n\\nStudents at Daegu Gyeongbuk High School taking the June mock exam for the 2020 College Scholastic Ability Test [Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nHowever, both teachers and admissions officers criticized that there are fairness problems with the current CSAT and comprehensive school record admissions (student record comprehensive evaluation).\\n\\nFor CSAT, problems cited were 'significant influence of hagwon education' (36.2%), 'insufficient consideration of non-academic characteristics such as character and special talents' (30.2%), and 'high possibility of luck playing a role in a one-time test' (25.4%).\\n\\nFor comprehensive school record admissions, problems pointed out included 'differences in school record documentation by school and teacher' (45.2%), 'reliability issues with school record documentation' (20.4%), and 'lack of transparency in the admission process' (17.8%).\\n\\nRegarding which admission type is fairer between CSAT-focused and school record-focused admissions, teachers favored CSAT-focused admissions (52.9%) while admissions officers favored school record-focused admissions (54.8%).\\n\\nHowever, both teachers and admissions officers drew the line that \\\"evaluation methods that apply the same standards to all applicants are not desirable.\\\"\\n\\nAs measures to improve university admission fairness, opinions that gained significant support included \\\"restrictions should be placed to prevent frequent changes to the admission system,\\\" \\\"entrance exam-focused education should be resolved,\\\" \\\"diverse admission types should be utilized,\\\" and \\\"admission quotas should be allocated for applicants with disadvantaged backgrounds.\\\"\\n\\nParents praying for 100 days for CSAT success on August 7th at Seoul Doseonsa Temple's main hall, 99 days before the 2020 College Scholastic Ability Test [Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nThe research team pointed out that \\\"looking at the controversies that arose during the recent university admission system reform process, there is a confrontational pattern between positions that define ability as 'CSAT-focused' and positions that define it as 'school record-focused,'\\\" and \\\"the former argues that viewing ability as 'scores' is just, while the latter criticizes that regional and family factors also influence scores.\\\"\\n\\nThey expressed concern that \\\"if fairness is narrowly perceived by focusing on the formal aspects of the system, it will only obscure deeper injustices and overlook the influence that the university admission system has on Korean society as a whole.\\\"\\n\\nThe research team suggested that securing university admission fairness requires expanding active measures such as regional balanced selection and equal opportunity admissions, strengthening admissions officer expertise and ethics, disclosing information about admitted students including their high school backgrounds, regions, and social classes by university admission type, and reducing income gaps between education levels.\\n\\nhyo@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI

President Moon Jae-in recently requested, \\\"There is controversy surrounding nominee Cho's family, but going beyond the dimension of this controversy, please review the overall college admission system.\\\" President Moon said, \\\"Although there have been efforts to improve the admissions system, there are still many citizens who think the admissions system is neither equitable nor fair,\\\" adding, \\\"We must face the fact that this especially causes deep wounds to the young generation who cannot access opportunities.\\\" President Moon has previously made remarks about the fairness and transparency of the college admissions system. In December last year, when receiving the Ministry of Education's 2019 work report, President Moon pointed out problems such as the fairness of school records [GPA] and school life record evaluations, and the 'black box admissions process' in early admissions.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education announced that it would begin full-scale discussions on improving the college admissions system as soon as Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Yoo Eun-hye, who is accompanying President Moon on his Southeast Asia tour, returns to Korea. However, it seems difficult to expect a college admissions system that guarantees fairness and transparency and can be implemented immediately. According to related laws, to overhaul the entire college admissions system, it must be announced four years before implementation, so even if a new system is introduced in the second half of this year, it can only be implemented for the 2024 academic year. The immediately emerging plan to expand regular admissions [정시] is a burdensome option for education authorities in terms of admissions policy stability. Negotiations with universities have already concluded for the 2022 academic year admissions with '70% early admissions [수시], 30% regular admissions [정시].' As other possible measures, it appears that the abolition of so-called 'golden spoon elements' such as self-introductions and award records in student record entries is being discussed to strengthen the fairness of the comprehensive student record admissions process [학종]. Plans to expand the 'equal opportunity admissions' within 학종 targeting low-income and rural students, and 'regional talent admissions' that broaden opportunities for local talent to enter regional flagship universities are also reportedly under consideration.\\n\\nHowever, President Moon probably did not order measures at this level. They fall far short of public expectations. They could face criticism for causing confusion among test-takers and parents through frequent admissions system reforms. As the Ministry of Education spokesperson said, since the college admissions system cannot be changed simply by fixing the admissions system alone, the overall high school education system must be examined. The direction and measures are found in the 'Three-Stage Roadmap for High School System Reform' presented in the early days of the Moon Jae-in administration. These are 'improvement of high school entrance systems, gradual conversion of autonomous private high schools to regular high schools, and high school system reform.' The other axis is the 'high school credit system' planned for implementation in 2025. This is a policy that allows high school students to select and take classes they want like university students, and graduate when they fulfill a certain standard of credits. Both high school system reform and the high school credit system are for public education normalization and innovation. According to the roadmap, the Ministry of Education and the political sphere must convert the National Education Council, a presidential education advisory body, to the National Education Committee as soon as possible to develop mid- to long-term education reform measures. The fairness and transparency of college admissions, and hagwon education [사교육] problems are also directly related to university hierarchy.

[Yonhap News file photo]\\n\\nHowever, the abolition of rolling admissions or comprehensive evaluations has slim prospects for realization at present.\\n\\nMost experts, including education bureaucrats and academics, shake their heads at the question 'Isn't standardized testing fairer than rolling admissions?'\\n\\nWhile CSAT appears more fair at first glance because everyone takes the same test at the same time, there are many research findings that standardized tests like CSAT are actually more unfair in terms of equal opportunity because they favor those with higher parental income and more hagwon education.\\n\\nThis trend is clearly visible in the 2015 research results 'The Impact of Parents' Education and Income Levels on Intergenerational Mobility and Opportunity Inequality' published by Professor Choi Pil-seon of Konkuk University, an expert in economic statistics, and Professor Min In-sik of Kyung Hee University.\\n\\nThis research examined how parents' education and income levels in 2007, when university admissions were centered on standardized testing and CSAT, affected their children's university enrollment and CSAT scores.\\n\\nThe results confirmed a tendency for higher parental income to correlate with higher children's CSAT scores.\\n\\nWhen parents were in the 5th income quintile, the rate of their children achieving CSAT grades 1-2 reached 11.0%, but when parental income dropped to the 1st quintile, the rate of children achieving CSAT grades 1-2 was only 2.3%, showing nearly a five-fold difference.\\n\\nThere are also public opinion survey results showing that higher income levels correlate with support for 'standardized test expansion.'\\n\\nIn a Korean Educational Development Institute survey of 2,000 men and women last year, higher-income groups were more likely to choose CSAT scores as 'the item that should be most reflected in university admission processes.'\\n\\n38.2% of respondents with monthly income of 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] or more chose CSAT, while 29.7% of those with income of 4-6 million won [approximately $3,000-4,500 USD] selected CSAT.\\n\\nIn contrast, respondents with income of 2-4 million won [approximately $1,500-3,000 USD] answered that 'special talents/aptitudes (30.4%)' should be most reflected in university admissions. 28.6% of respondents with income below 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] also chose special talents/aptitudes.\\n\\nRegarding this, one education statistics expert analyzed, \\\"Like other fields, but especially in education, public opinion tends to be formed centered on Seoul metropolitan area residents, highly educated, high-income parents,\\\" adding \\\"Parents who can afford hagwon education believe that CSAT has clearer hagwon education effects than comprehensive evaluations.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the Ministry of Education's perspective, the fact that last year's public deliberation process on university admission systems resulted in a '30% standardized testing' conclusion also serves as grounds for viewing calls to abolish rolling admissions as partial and temporary.\\n\\nThe comprehensive investigation of rolling admissions and comprehensive evaluations demanded by some is also practically impossible.\\n\\nA Ministry of Education official stated, \\\"If we broadly divide comprehensive evaluations, it's a two-stage structure where students create application materials through activities inside and outside school, and universities evaluate these,\\\" adding \\\"Conducting a comprehensive investigation of this would mean investigating all universities, high schools, teachers, and volunteer organizations as potential criminals, which is absolutely impossible.\\\"\\n\\nWhile investigations based on specific case reports are possible—like the case of a student who fabricated research achievements with help from their mother, a pharmacy professor, to enter Seoul National University graduate school but had their admission canceled—comprehensive investigations are practically difficult.\\n\\nParental income level and children's CSAT score correlation [Paper capture / 'The Impact of Parents' Education and Income Levels on Intergenerational Mobility and Opportunity Inequality' (2015)]\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education maintains its position of continuing efforts to enhance the credibility of comprehensive evaluations.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education stated, \\\"While conducting university audits, we will focus on confirming whether admission processes are unfair, and continue to examine whether there are areas for improvement to make comprehensive evaluations a trustworthy university admission system.\\\"\\n\\nhyo@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder(c) Yonhap News,

Etoos instructors Baek In-deok and Baek Ho, known as the 'Baek Brothers,' were also indicted on the same charges as CEO Kim.\\nThis conclusion came 1 year and 4 months after police referred CEO Kim and others to the prosecution with a recommendation for indictment.\\nCEO Kim and others are suspected of signing contracts worth over 1 billion won [approximately $750,000 USD] with viral marketing company G for nearly 5 years from May 2012 to around December 2016, having them post approximately 200,000 posts and comments promoting their own instructors and slandering competing college prep company instructors.\\n'Comment part-timers' who received guidelines from Company G intensively posted comments on internet sites frequently visited by test-takers and communities such as Orbi, Sumanhwi, and Ilgan Best.\\nTwo employees of Company G who were involved in this were also brought to trial on charges of comment manipulation (computer obstruction of business, violation of Personal Information Protection Act, violation of Telecommunications Business Act).\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Sang-hak = Hagwon instructor Woo Hyung-cheol (center) makes related remarks at a press conference for reporting illegal hagwon education promotion and urging its eradication, hosted by a parents' group calling for normalization of hagwon education, held at the Press Center in Jung-gu, Seoul in 2017. 2017.3.7 leesh@yna.co.kr\\n\\nEtoos' comment promotion controversy has erupted several times in the past, but this is the first time CEO Kim has been brought to trial.\\nEtoos posted apology letters about comment part-timers on its homepage and promised to prevent recurrence in 2007, 2011, and 2017.\\nThe recent comment manipulation controversy was sparked by college entrance math instructor Woo Hyung-cheol, known as 'Sapjaru.' In January 2017, Woo, who was affiliated with Etoos at the time, exposed that \\\"Etoos hires comment part-timers to write posts that disparage competing hagwons or instructors and manipulates search rankings as marketing.\\\" Woo is a figure who reported the comment manipulation practices in the college prep hagwon industry and even formed the 'Clean Online Lecture Council' with other instructors who opposed manipulation.\\nAs Woo continued his exposures, a parent group called 'Parents' Group Calling for Normalization of Hagwon Education' (Sajeongmo) took action. They held a press conference claiming that \\\"star instructors Seol Min-seok and Choi Jin-gi deceived parents and students choosing hagwons through illegal comment promotion.\\\" They subsequently raised suspicions about comment promotion by popular Korean history instructor Choi Tae-seong and math instructor Shin Seung-beom.\\nSajeongmo filed criminal complaints against Etoos instructors one after another in March-April 2017, claiming that Etoos gained over 100 billion won [approximately $75 million USD] in unjust profits from tuition revenue through comment promotion and obstructed competitors' business.\\nAt the time, Etoos countered suspicions about its affiliated instructors hiring 'comment part-timers' by saying \\\"Sajeongmo is a phantom organization with no substance\\\" and that instructors never engaged in illegal comment promotion or hired comment part-time workers.\\nAs a result of the investigation, Etoos' systematic comment promotion activities were revealed to be true, but instructors Seol Min-seok, Choi Jin-gi, Choi Tae-seong, and Shin Seung-beom received no-charges dispositions last year. This was because they only gave lectures while promotion was handled by their affiliated company, Etoos. In the case of instructors Baek In-deok and Baek Ho, circumstances of their involvement in hiring comment part-timers were revealed, leading to trial.\\nSajeongmo has appealed the prosecution's no-charges disposition regarding instructor Seol Min-seok and others.\\nchopark@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and utilization prohibited>2019/07/14 08:00 sent, July 14, 2019 08:00 sent\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3572, "output_tokens": 1419, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It is known that over 4 million members are registered with the six major publicly listed intermediary services. Including unlisted emerging intermediary services, there are estimates that registered users reach 7 million annually, representing a 40% increase over the past year.\\n\\nWhile simple comparison is difficult since many people register with multiple service companies, this represents a scale equivalent to 10% of Japan's total workforce, estimated at approximately 67 million people.\\n\\nThis work style, also called 'gig working' - combining the English word 'gig' meaning temporary day-to-day employment and 'worker' - is spreading due to Japan's serious labor shortage, plus changes in the work environment from work style reforms that the government and companies are promoting, including encouraging side jobs.\\n\\nDue to aging and population decline, Japan is expected to face shortages of 290,000 workers in the restaurant industry and 340,000 workers in elderly and patient care sectors within five years.\\n\\nThe government is promoting the recruitment of foreign workers, but complete replacement with foreigners is difficult to expect. Additionally, besides the existing six listed companies, new intermediary services are continuously emerging, including 'Taimee,' which introduces talent to the food and retail industries; 'Sukedachi,' which is strong in construction industry labor intermediation; and 'Hacobell,' which promotes utilizing truck drivers' free time.\\n\\nIn Taimee's case, when you register available time slots and locations on your smartphone, they connect you with suitable candidates when part-time job recruitment companies contact them. With just a few simple mobile phone operations without interviews or other procedures, you can find part-time work and receive payment immediately after finishing the job.\\n\\n[Taimee homepage capture]\\n\\nWatanabe Tenma (27), who works five days a week as a hagwon instructor for college entrance exams, did a side job distributing promotional tissues at an eyewear store in Tokyo on Saturday when he wasn't teaching, through Taimee in late last month.\\n\\nAfter finishing distributing 600 tissues in 4 hours, he moved to Yokohama and worked at an izakaya [Japanese-style pub] for 4.5 hours starting at 6 PM, then worked part-time at a sushi restaurant in Tokyo for 4 hours the next day, Sunday.\\n\\nThrough such 'side jobs,' he earns about 100,000 yen [approximately $750 USD] per month at most. He said, \\\"I can easily experience various types of work, so it's always fresh.\\\"\\n\\nThe government included side job promotion in the growth strategy prepared last month. The policy intention is to diversify work styles and support innovation through talent mobility.

359,000 compared to a year ago in the fourth quarter of last year, showing an expanded growth rate.\\n\\nWage employment jobs increased significantly, centered on health and social welfare services due to the effects of government job programs, but construction, business services and leasing, and manufacturing jobs continued their decline, showing mixed situations across industries.\\n\\nAccording to the 'Q4 2018 (November basis) Wage Employment Job Trends' data released by Statistics Korea on the 20th, total wage employment jobs (hereafter 'jobs') in Q4 last year were 18.494 million, an increase of 359,000 (2.0%) compared to the same period the previous year.\\n\\nThe job growth rate compared to the same period the previous year had continuously shrunk from 315,000 in Q1 last year (February basis) to 245,000 in Q2 (May basis) and 213,000 in Q3 (August basis), but expanded in Q4.\\n\\nAmong Q4 jobs last year, 'continuing jobs' occupied by the same workers as the previous year numbered 12.408 million (67.1%), while jobs where workers were replaced due to retirement or job changes numbered 3.247 million (17.6%).\\n\\nNew jobs created through business establishment or expansion numbered 2.84 million (15.4%), while eliminated jobs that disappeared due to business closure or downsizing numbered 2.481 million.\\n\\nLooking at job changes by industry in Q4 last year, health and social welfare increased by 114,000 jobs, wholesale and retail by 92,000, professional, scientific and technical services by 46,000, and education by 44,000.\\n\\nPublic administration, defense and social security administration also increased by 38,000, and accommodation and food services increased by 38,000.\\n\\nStatistics Korea interpreted that government job-related policies influenced job growth in health and social welfare services and wholesale and retail sectors.\\n\\nPark Jin-woo, Director of the Administrative Statistics Division at Statistics Korea, said, \\\"In health and social welfare, demand for medical and health personnel increased, leading to significant job growth centered on women in their 50s and 60s, and in wholesale and retail, as production continued to expand, employment insurance subscribers increased, which was captured in job expansion statistics.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding factors in job growth, he explained, \\\"Wholesale and retail production increased due to economic factors, policy-wise employment insurance subscribers increased due to expanded implementation of job stability fund support, and institutionally, the mandatory enrollment conditions for employment insurance were relaxed for ultra-short-time workers classified as those working less than 60 hours per month, expanding employment insurance enrollment regardless of livelihood considerations.\\\"\\n\\nConversely, construction jobs decreased by 96,000, business services and leasing by 38,000, and manufacturing by 12,000.\\n\\nComparing construction jobs to the same period the previous year, they decreased by 35,000 in Q1, 84,000 in Q2, and 113,000 in Q3 last year, with the decline expanding, but the declining trend slowed in Q4.\\n\\nBusiness facility management, business support, and leasing services decreased by 4,000 in Q1, 28,000 in Q2, 36,000 in Q3, and 38,000 in Q4 last year, expanding the decline.\\n\\nThe manufacturing job decline expanded from 16,000 in Q2 and 19,000 in Q3 last year, then contracted to 12,000 in Q4.\\n\\nDirector Park Jin-woo explained, \\\"Manufacturing and construction continue to see job decreases due to economic conditions and restructuring aftereffects.\\\"\\n\\nLooking at jobs by age, those 50 and over increased significantly, but those in their 40s decreased.\\n\\nIn Q4 last year, jobs for those in their 50s increased by 166,000 compared to the same period the previous year, those 60 and over by 151,000, those in their 20s and under by 56,000, and those in their 30s by 12,000 respectively.\\n\\nHowever, jobs for those in their 40s decreased by 26,000, centered on construction and manufacturing.\\n\\nBy gender, women's jobs increased by 283,000 and men's by 75,000 respectively.\\n\\nBy enterprise type, government and non-corporate organization jobs increased by 128,000, corporate jobs by 118,000, non-corporate legal entities by 96,000, and individual enterprises by 17,000.\\n\\nDirector Park said, \\\"As job growth expanded in Q4 last year, men's jobs, jobs for those in their 30s, and individual enterprise jobs all turned to growth after declining in the previous quarter,\\\" adding \\\"However, we need to watch a bit longer to see if this trend continues.\\\"\\n\\nThis survey targeted wage employment jobs, which differs from employment trends shown in the Economically Active Population Survey that includes non-wage workers.\\n\\nThe survey results identified jobs of workers engaged in wage labor activities at enterprises based on eight types of administrative data available monthly and quarterly, including social insurance, daily labor income, and business registration data.\\n\\nHere, 'jobs' refers to employment positions occupied by workers, which has a different meaning from 'employed persons.'\\n\\nFor instance, job numbers are calculated based on working days, so if someone worked only 15 days in a month, the job count is calculated as 0.5.\\n\\nAlso, if someone working at a trading company also works as a hagwon instructor at night, there is one employed person but multiple jobs can be counted.\\n\\n(Seoul=Yonhap

The number of students taking Korean language classes at this school has grown significantly each year: 220 in 2017, 285 in 2018.\\nVietnamese Korean language learners often start with interest in Korean due to K-pop and other Korean popular culture, then continue learning for employment purposes.\\nTruduc High School student Hong Ngoc (16) said, \\\"I'm learning Korean because I'm curious about the meaning of Korean idol group song lyrics.\\\" Although Ngoc had only been learning Korean for a short time and hesitated several times even when speaking short sentences, she fluently sang 'Energetic' by Wanna One, her favorite idol group, without stopping once.\\n(Ho Chi Minh City=Yonhap News) Reporter Lee Jae-young = A student at Truduc High School in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam is concentrating on class with Korean language textbooks spread on her desk on the 5th (local time). 2019.12.5\\n\\nYouTube is also playing a role in spreading Korean among Vietnamese youth. Hong's friend Mai Cham pointed to YouTuber 'Cherry Hyeri' as her Korean 'private tutor.' Cherry Hyeri presents videos comparing the cultures of both countries while mixing Korean and Vietnamese.\\nAsking Vietnamese university students studying Korean why they learn Korean was like asking Korean university students preparing for employment why they study English.\\nIf they get jobs at Korean companies, they receive 'high wages' of 700,000-800,000 won [approximately $530-600 USD] per month, more than 2.5 times the average salary of Vietnamese university graduates. For this reason, most university students learn Korean with the goal of getting jobs at Korean companies, local officials explain.\\nNguyen Thi Phuong Mai, department head of the Korean Studies Department at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities under Ho Chi Minh National University, said, \\\"Students who major in Korean and go to Korea for language study don't need to worry about employment,\\\" adding, \\\"Many students get jobs in their third year and delay graduation because they're working.\\\"\\nThanks to the high employment rate, the Korean Studies Department is a popular department even within the prestigious University of Social Sciences and Humanities. School officials disclosed that students need to score about 5 points higher than other departments on the entrance exam out of 30 points to be in the acceptance range.\\nVietnamese Korean language education officials point out that Korea's support needs to be expanded.\\nThey say they cannot accelerate the spread of Korean because it's like having only one oar when the tide is coming in and you need to row.\\nThe most urgent problem is securing Korean language teaching personnel.\\nThe Korean Studies Department at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Ho Chi Minh City has about 720 students but currently employs 23 instructors, meaning one instructor handles about 30 students, exceeding the university's own standards (20 students per faculty member). The fact that most instructors are master's level rather than doctoral level is also an area for improvement.\\nMoreover, the Korean Studies Department at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities plans to establish a 'Korean Studies' major in graduate school next year, the first in Vietnam. For this graduate program to take root, professor-level instructors proficient not only in Korean language but also in Korea's politics, culture, and society overall are needed.\\nInsufficient Korean learning content is also cited as a problem. The Overseas Education Institution Portal created by the government to help foreigners learn Korean still has low recognition.\\nHeo Seon, a teacher dispatched by the National Institute for International Education who teaches Korean at Truduc High School, explained, \\\"Korean is still a foreign language in Vietnam that only those who want it need to choose and study,\\\" adding, \\\"Young students immediately choose other languages if they find it boring, so interesting content is necessary to consistently teach Korean.\\\"\\nThe immediate task is to get Korean language into formal curriculum where Vietnamese middle and high school students can choose it as their first foreign language. Currently, Korean is a 'secondary school second foreign language pilot subject.'\\nVietnamese middle and high school students must choose and learn one of five first foreign languages—English, Japanese, Chinese, French, or Russian—according to government policy. These first foreign languages are taught from elementary school (grades 1-5).\\nJapan implemented Japanese language expansion policies in Vietnam ahead of Korea and included Japanese as a formal first foreign language subject in 2016.\\nA Ministry of Education official stated, \\\"We will closely cooperate with Vietnamese authorities so that Korean language will be adopted as a formal subject once the pilot subject operation ends.\\\"\\njylee24@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder(c) Yonhap News, unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>2019/12/09 12:00 transmission December 9, 2019 12:00 PM transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4360, "output_tokens": 1657, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

and Explanations... \\\"Criminal Acts\\\" vs \\\"Not True\\\"\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"(Seoul=Yonhap News) Lee Seul-ki, Lee Eun-jung, Lee Dong-hwan reporters = The National Assembly's confirmation hearing on September 6 for Justice Minister nominee Cho Kuk resembled a battlefield where spears and shields clashed, with various allegations and explanations surrounding the nominee going back and forth.\\n(Seoul=Yonhap News) Kim Ju-hyung reporter = Justice Minister nominee Cho Kuk responds to lawmakers' questions at the Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing held at the National Assembly on the morning of September 6. kjhpress@yna.co.kr\\n\\nThe early part of the confirmation hearing that began at 10 a.m. focused intensively on allegations of forging a Dongyang University presidential commendation used by his daughter Ms. Cho (28) for admission to Pusan National University's graduate medical school, Professor Chung Kyung-sim's (57) removal of a PC before the search and seizure, and the contents of nominee Cho's phone conversation with Dongyang University President Choi Sung-hae.\\n\\nThe main opposition Liberty Korea Party presented the original Dongyang University presidential commendation and argued that Professor Chung Kyung-sim was involved in forging the commendation, pressuring that nominee Cho's direct phone conversation with President Choi Sung-hae constituted solicitation of evidence destruction.\\n\\nNominee Cho actively denied the opposition lawmakers' allegations with responses to the effect of 'that is not true' and 'I was not involved,' while responding to the ruling party lawmakers' support with 'I agree' and 'that's right,' going on the defensive.\\n\\n◇ Allegations of Dongyang University Presidential Commendation Forgery\\n\\nThe Korea Party argued that nominee Cho's daughter forged a Dongyang University presidential commendation and submitted it for Pusan National University's graduate medical school admission.\\n\\nThey claimed that the official format of the Dongyang University presidential commendation has a serial number written in the upper left corner, and at the bottom it states 'Dongyang University President, Doctor of Education Choi Sung-hae.'\\n\\nIn contrast, the Korea Party pressed that the commendation submitted by Mr. Cho's daughter had 'Language Education Center' written in the upper left corner and at the bottom only stated 'Dongyang University President Choi Sung-hae' with 'Doctor of Education' excluded.\\n\\nThe Korea Party raised their voices saying that if a forged commendation was submitted for Pusan National University's graduate medical school admission, it would constitute charges of forging private documents and obstruction of official duties for interfering with the admission process of Pusan National University, a national university.\\n\\nThey then demanded that nominee Cho submit the original commendation or photo files that his daughter submitted to clarify the relevant allegations.\\n\\nThey also raised suspicions that Ms. Cho did not do volunteer work at all, noting that Professor Chung was employed at Dongyang University from July 2011, but the commendation submitted by nominee Cho's daughter stated she did volunteer work at Dongyang University from 2010 to September 2012.\\n\\nThe Korea Party also mentioned that Professor Kim Ju-sik, who first established Dongyang University's English Gifted Education Center, revealed that 'center instructors were native-speaking professors and assistance was directly provided by teaching assistants or instructors, so there was no need for outside volunteers in the system.'\\n\\nRegarding this, nominee Cho said that if his spouse's commendation forgery were true, \\\"I think it could constitute a crime,\\\" but refuted that the allegations were not true.\\n\\nHe also said, \\\"My child went to middle and high school student programs\\\" and \\\"The entity issuing the commendation is also the Language Education Center, not the Gifted Education Center, so you are talking about something completely different,\\\" adding \\\"It is a clear fact that our child did various English-related volunteer activities including English essay editing for youth in the North Gyeongsang region.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, nominee Cho answered that \\\"how commendations are managed is something I know nothing about.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding the volunteer period starting from 2010 as stated in the commendation submitted by his daughter Ms. Cho, he said \\\"I think it was incorrectly recorded\\\" and \\\"I have seen a photo of the commendation my daughter received, so I will submit it.\\\"\\n\\nDemocratic Party lawmakers Kim Jong-min and Park Ju-min raised the possibility that Dongyang University's certificate and commendation formats may not have been standardized, lending support to nominee Cho's side.\\n\\n◇ Direct Phone Call with Dongyang University President\\n\\nThe Korea Party attacked that nominee Cho's direct phone conversation with Dongyang University President Choi Sung-hae regarding the university presidential commendation forgery allegations was not only inappropriate but could even constitute charges of solicitation of evidence destruction and solicitation of perjury.\\n\\nKorea Party lawmaker Jang Je-won said, \\\"The Dongyang University president reportedly has a recording file of the conversation,\\\" adding \\\"In front, he says 'I can't talk to the parties involved because of the allegations,' but through the back door he talked to someone who raises suspicions.\\\"\\n\\nLawmaker Kim Jin-tae of the same party cited President Choi's media interview, saying \\\"Nominee Cho saying 'the president will live and Professor Chung will live' means 'if you don't say what I want, Professor Chung will die and the president will die too,'\\\" adding \\\"This is implicit intimidation and coercion, and I will file a complaint against the nominee today.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding this, nominee Cho explained, \\\"At the end of my wife's phone call, I took over and had a brief conversation,\\\" adding \\\"My wife was in a startled state and said various things including asking (President Choi) 'Didn't you delegate this?' so I took over the phone and said 'President, I can't ask you to lie, please investigate and clarify the facts.'\\\"\\n\\nNominee Cho said, \\\"My wife was so surprised on the day of the search and seizure that she called the president and complained while saying 'Didn't you delegate this to us?' I don't know the conversation content, but the president probably said 'I didn't do it,'\\\" adding \\\"At the end of the call, my wife was too excited, so I told her to 'calm down' and told the president I was sorry and just asked him to investigate well since my wife was making such claims.\\\"\\n\\n◇ Allegations of Involvement in Dankook University Medical School First-Author Paper and Spouse's PC Removal\\n\\nThe Korea Party brought up the fact that 'Cho Kuk' was recorded as the file information creator and final saver of an English medical paper in which nominee Cho's daughter was listed as first author while attending Hanyoung Foreign Language High School as a second-year student.\\n\\nThis raised suspicions that nominee Cho wrote his daughter's medical paper for her.\\n\\nLawmaker Kim Jin-tae attacked, saying \\\"Files claimed to have been written on a home PC were revealed through forensics to have been created on a Seoul National University College of Law PC.\\\"\\n\\nNominee Cho denied allegations that he helped with his daughter's paper, saying \\\"I have two PCs at home, and the computer in my study is used by my wife and child as well.\\\"\\n\\nNominee Cho explained, \\\"Because it's our home computer, my affiliation and name were saved,\\\" adding \\\"Because I used a word processing program provided by Seoul National University, my name and affiliation that I had entered in advance appear. Whether it's my son or daughter, whoever uses my PC, the file information comes up as my information.\\\"\\n\\nHe said, \\\"When the school (Seoul National University) provides a PC, software is automatically installed. When that PC becomes too old to use, a new PC is provided,\\\" adding \\\"In that case, there are times when I bring home and use PCs that the school no longer uses, and if that is considered an oversight, I think it's my oversight.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding the opposition's pursuit of allegations that his spouse Professor Chung Kyung-sim faced evidence destruction charges for taking a PC from Dongyang University two days before the search and seizure, nominee Cho explained, \\\"She was in an awkward situation due to coverage by various media outlets. She probably needed to look at and check the contents of the PC in her research office,\\\" adding \\\"But because she couldn't go to work at her research office, she went to get the PC.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding the opposition's pursuit that Professor Chung's PC was found in a Korea Investment & Securities employee's car trunk, he said, \\\"My wife was in very poor health, so a Korea Investment employee drove for her. My wife told him to hold onto the PC until she returned from going down to Busan, and they met after she returned to Seoul,\\\" adding \\\"Later, the prosecution contacted us and we voluntarily submitted the PC as is.\\\"\\n\\nNominee Cho said, \\\"There are many suspicions about my wife, some parts I know and some parts I don't know. Since an investigation is ongoing, I think (more suspicions) will come out,\\\" adding \\\"I think we should naturally accept the results (regarding the prosecution's investigation).\\\"\\n\\nwise@yna.co.kr\\nTips via KakaoTalk okjebo<Copyright holder (c) Yonhap News, Unauthorized reproduction-redistribution, AI learning and use prohibited>September 6, 2019 14:31 transmission September 6, 2019 2:31 PM transmission\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 5331, "output_tokens": 2303, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
