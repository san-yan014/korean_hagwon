The two leaders held a summit meeting that day and discussed such measures, stating that \\\"North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is absolutely unacceptable,\\\" according to Song Min-soon, Director of National Security Policy at the Blue House. After the meeting, President Bush said at a press briefing, \\\"I want North Korean leaders to know that if North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons and nuclear ambitions, we will enter into consultations about providing security guarantees for North Korea and economic incentives.\\\" White House spokesperson Tony Snow provided additional clarification, explaining that regarding President Bush's statement that \\\"security for North Korea and corresponding measures would be provided if North Korea abandons its nuclear program,\\\" \\\"a formal declaration ending the Korean War could be included.\\\" He explained that the corresponding measures the U.S. would take \\\"include economic cooperation and strengthening ties in areas such as culture and education.\\\" Spokesperson Snow said, \\\"President Bush views North Korea's announcement of returning to talks as a moment of opportunity,\\\" and \\\"the two leaders discussed the importance of cooperating within the six-party talks framework to make clear that North Korea must abandon its nuclear program.\\\"\\n\\nResumption of Mortgage Loans: Major commercial banks including Kookmin and Shinhan, which had suspended new mortgage loans on the 17th, decided to resume normal mortgage lending operations starting this week. The banks, which had completely suspended new loans following de facto total lending volume control measures by financial supervisory authorities, changed their stance and decided to provide mortgage loans to actual homebuyers. Kookmin and Shinhan banks, which had completely suspended new loans due to the Financial Supervisory Service's 'window guidance,' urgently sent official notices to their branches instructing them to provide loans to actual homebuyers as before. A Kookmin Bank official said on the 19th, \\\"We withdrew the plan to carry over new mortgage loans to December,\\\" and \\\"We plan to make 100% loans available especially to loan applicants who are in urgent financial situations after signing real estate purchase contracts.\\\" Kim Jung-hoe, Deputy Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, said, \\\"Customer complaints arose due to the suspension of new loans, so we requested that commercial bank working-level staff not suspend new loans to actual homebuyers,\\\" and \\\"The FSS never requested total volume control of collateral loans from commercial banks in the first place.\\\" Meanwhile, starting on the 20th, the Debt-to-Income ratio (DTI), which limits mortgage loan amounts based on income, will be applied not only to apartments over 600 million won [approximately $450,000 USD] in speculative areas but also to speculative overheating districts in the Seoul metropolitan area.\\n\\n'Seoul Reconstruction' Prices Drop: The surge in Seoul reconstruction apartment prices appears to have dropped for the first time since Chuseok [Korean autumn harvest festival]. While the price decline is not large, this is the first time Seoul apartment prices have fallen since Chuseok, leading to analysis that this could be the beginning of a full-scale price drop. According to the real estate industry on the 19th, the 16-pyeong [approximately 530 square feet] units at Godeok-dong Jugong Complex 3, which had risen by 50-70 million won [approximately $38,000-53,000 USD] in the past month, were asking 610-620 million won [approximately $460,000-470,000 USD] before the November 15th measures but are now 600-605 million won [approximately $450,000-455,000 USD]. An official at a licensed real estate agency in Seoul's Godeok-dong said, \\\"Homeowners' anxiety about price drops is growing, and distressed sales are appearing one by one.\\\" Seoul's Gangdong District Dunchon Complex has also entered a wait-and-see phase, with properties gradually increasing and returning to a weak sideways trend. For 16-pyeong units at Dunchon Jugong Complex 1, asking prices dropped from 670-680 million won [approximately $505,000-515,000 USD] to 650-660 million won [approximately $490,000-500,000 USD]. Seoul's Songpa District Jugong Complex 5 is also seeing an increasing number of distressed sales. 34-pyeong [approximately 1,120 square feet] units are showing 1.3-1.32 billion won [approximately $980,000-995,000 USD], and 36-pyeong [approximately 1,190 square feet] units are in the 1.63-1.65 billion won [approximately $1.23-1.24 million USD] range. This represents a drop of about 10-20 million won [approximately $7,500-15,000 USD] from peak prices in the past month. An official at a licensed real estate agency in nearby Jamsil-dong said, \\\"Properties have increased from the usual 10 or so to 15-20, but both sellers and buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach, so no transactions are taking place,\\\" and \\\"With many buyers waiting, once we pass this brief 'catching our breath' phase, housing prices will fall further.\\\"\\n\\nAPEC Summary... Success in Oral Statement of Concern Over North Korean Nuclear Issue: The 14th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit held in Hanoi, Vietnam, issued a chairman's oral statement regarding North Korea's nuclear program before closing on the 19th. Leaders from various countries expressed deep concern, dedicating substantial portions of bilateral and multilateral meetings to the North Korean nuclear issue. President Roh Moo-hyun, speaking 19th in the summit's second day of meetings, announced that Korea plans to contribute $2 million to the APEC support fund for capacity building in developing countries in the region from 2007 to 2009. The issuance of a separate oral statement on the North Korean nuclear issue at APEC reflects the fact that leaders from the 21 member countries shared such serious concern about the North Korean nuclear problem. However, leaders reportedly engaged in fierce debate over the format and content of the statement. Ultimately, given that North Korea had expressed its intention to return to six-party talks and meetings were scheduled for next month, the decision was made for a chairman's oral statement containing leaders' urging to achieve substantial results rather than provoke North Korea. The chairman's oral statement is not an official document and has no binding force, taking the form of a recommendation. According to government officials attending APEC, the oral statement expressed clear concern about North Korea's missile launches and nuclear weapons tests while focusing on early resumption of six-party talks and substantial, efficient measures based on last year's September 19 joint statement.\\n\\n'Fairy' Kim Yuna's First Adult Competition Victory: 'Figure skating fairy' Kim Yuna (16, Gunpo Suri High School) achieved the feat of her first victory on the adult stage at the 2006-07 International Skating Union (ISU) Figure Skating Senior Grand Prix Series 4th competition. Kim Yuna scored the highest 119.32 points among 11 competitors in the women's singles free skating held at the Bercy Indoor Ice Rink in Paris, France on the 19th (Korean time), taking first place. Combined with the 65.22 points (1st place) she received in the short program held the previous day, her total score of 184.54 points beat Japan's Ando Miki (174.44 points) for overall first place. This is the first time a Korean skater has won a gold medal on the ISU senior Grand Prix stage in 100 years of Korean figure skating history. Kim Yuna, who became the first Korean skater to win gold at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Slovenia last March, conquered the senior stage in just eight months, raising the possibility of a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.\\n\\n[JoongAng Ilbo] 'New City Housing Sales Possible from 2010, Not 2008': Due to post-completion sales system application, delayed over 2 years from government announcement. While the government decided through the November 15 real estate measures to significantly increase new city housing supply from 2008, it appears that full-scale housing sales will only be possible from 2010. From 2010, the government plans to include household income and real estate assets as scoring factors through subscription system reforms, making it virtually difficult for homeowners or high-income earners to enter new cities in popular areas like Songpa. According to the Ministry of Construction and Transportation on the 20th, with the revision of land development project processing guidelines on the 17th, sales can only be made from next year after business approval and construction progress exceeds 40%. Public land supplied to private companies is also likely to become post-completion sales, as companies applying for post-completion sales receive priority in business selection. A Ministry of Construction and Transportation official said, \\\"According to these regulations, most new cities built in the future will be subject to the post-completion sales system,\\\" and \\\"Considering it takes about 1-2 years to reach 40% construction progress, actual sales will be possible about 2 years after business approval.\\\" Furthermore, the government plans to strengthen the post-completion sales construction progress standard to 60% from 2009, so sales schedules for new cities like Songpa, Incheon Geomdan, Paju Phase 3, and Pyeongtaek are expected to be further delayed.\\n\\n[Hankyoreh] Pro-Democracy Figure Tainted by Gift Certificate Corruption: Park Sung-hoon (49), one of the key figures in the 1970s Yonsei University student movement, was arrested by prosecutors on suspicions of adult gaming machine corruption. With Park's arrest, attention is focused on whether allegations that game and gift certificate company officials approached pro-democracy figures for business selection lobbying will be clarified. Park led the October 1977 'Yonsei Democratic Defense Struggle Declaration' incident, considered the largest anti-Yushin university student protest during the Park Chung-hee regime's 'Emergency Measure No. 9' era, which even punished critical remarks about the constitution. This protest, called the 'Muak Valley Battle' in student movement history, began with Yonsei University students demanding abolition of the Yushin system and lifting of emergency measures, then expanded significantly as it spread to nearby Ewha Womans University and Sogang University. About 4,000 students came out of the school gates for the first time since the declaration of Emergency Measure No. 9 in 1975, occupying the Sinchon area of Seoul and engaging in fierce stone-throwing battles with police. Park was sentenced to one year in prison for this incident and is known to have devoted himself to labor movements afterward. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Special Investigation Team announced on the 19th that Park is charged with receiving 200 million won [approximately $150,000 USD] from a gift certificate issuing company (aggravated bribery under the Special Act on Punishment of Specific Crimes). According to prosecutors, Park received a request from Kim, CEO of Company H which issues leisure culture gift certificates, in March 2005 to \\\"help get selected as a certified gift certificate issuing company,\\\" then told Kim that \\\"contact with Ministry of Culture or Game Industry Development Agency screening committee members had been made,\\\" and received money the following month after Company H was selected as a certified gift certificate company.\\n\\n[Hankook Ilbo] Not One Follows 'Tuition Standards': In a recent special crackdown by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, about 28% of hagwons were caught charging excessive tuition fees beyond government-set standards. However, when the Hankook Ilbo planning team randomly selected 50 hagwons in Seoul and metropolitan areas for supplementary education, college entrance exams, essay writing, and language instruction to investigate tuition collection practices from the 18th to 29th of last month, not a single hagwon was found to properly follow government guidelines. This is analyzed to be because while hagwons use sophisticated methods such as false tuition posting, separate credit card payments, and depositing tuition into instructor-named accounts to avoid crackdowns, government oversight remains superficial due to insufficient manpower and inadequate continuous monitoring systems. According to our reporting team's investigation, among all 50 target hagwons, 30 hagwons (60%) charged tuition 100% or more above standards, with 10 of these (20%) exceeding 200%. Additionally, there were 12 hagwons (24%) exceeding by 50-99%, and 8 hagwons (16%) exceeding by 1-49%. This differs significantly from the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's special crackdown from July 23 to August 7, which targeted 244 hagwons in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Yangcheon, and Nowon districts and caught 68 hagwons (27.8% of total) violating tuition standards.\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Individual Bankruptcy Applications Likely to Exceed 100,000: Due to economic downturn effects, individual bankruptcy applications are expected to exceed 100,000 for the first time this year. According to financial sector sources and the Supreme Court on the 19th, the number of individual bankruptcy applicants from January through September this year was 85,455, 3.6 times the 23,708 in the same period last year and far exceeding last year's total of 38,773. Since April, monthly individual bankruptcy applicants have reached 10,000-11,000 levels, and if this trend continues, total individual bankruptcy applicants this year are expected to exceed 100,000 for the first time, reaching 110,000-120,000. Private research institute officials diagnose that while the number of applicants has increased partly due to relaxed bankruptcy application requirements, the fundamental cause is poor income and employment conditions.\\n\\n[Kookmin Ilbo] 'The Host' Wins 6 Awards at Korea Film Awards: The film 'The Host' (produced by Chungeoram) proved itself this year's most talked-about film by winning 6 categories including Best Picture and Best Director at the 5th Korea Film Awards. At the ceremony held from 6 PM on the 19th at Universal Art Center in Seoul's Neung-dong, 'The Host' swept 6 categories including Best Picture and Best Director, as well as Best Cinematography, Best Lighting, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound. The Best Actor award went to Jo In-sung for 'A Dirty Carnival.' The Best Actress award went to Jang Jin-young from 'Love, So Divine,' who appeared as a presenter in place of Jeon Do-yeon, who could not attend the ceremony. Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards went to Lee Beom-su for 'The King and the Clown' and Chu Ja-hyun for 'Between Love and Hate.' The Best New Actor award went to Lee Jun-gi for his passionate performance in 'The King and the Clown.'\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] 'Floating Stage' Coming to Han River: From next spring, cultural and artistic performances can be enjoyed on a 'floating stage' on the Han River. Seoul Han River Citizen Park Office announced on the 20th, \\\"Starting around April next year, we plan to allow cultural and artistic groups to install floating stages on the Han River using barges (flat-bottomed cargo transport ships) for performances.\\\" However, since barges are reserve supplies and their conversion to other uses is prohibited, they cannot be used as permanent stages but only temporarily. The office is considering the Nanji District's 1st Waterside Stage as the primary candidate for floating stage installation. This location already has a 3,000-seat tiered audience area, so performances can begin immediately once a stage is installed.\\n\\n[Chosun Ilbo] 'Returned POW' No. 1 Jo Chang-ho Dies: At the funeral home for Reserve Lieutenant Jo Chang-ho (76), who died of chronic illness at 0:30 AM on the 19th at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, his wife Yoon Shin-ja (66) sat in a daze looking at his portrait. \\\"He used to beat his chest saying there are still many Korean War POWs in North Korea suffering from pneumoconiosis and dying after harsh coal mine labor. If the government ignores soldiers in danger, who will fight for the country? He was also heartbroken that he would never see the children he left behind in North Korea.\\\" Jo was a 'returned dead man' - the first Korean War POW to escape North Korea and return to South Korea in 1994.\\n\\nPostscript: The educational backgrounds of 'star' executives at Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest company, show that befitting a global company, one in five graduated from foreign universities, and contrary to expectations, only about 7% are from Seoul National University, Korea's top university. According to Samsung Electronics' quarterly report (as of November 4) submitted on the 20th, among 721 executives excluding outside directors, advisors, consultants, and advisory roles, 138 graduated from foreign universities - overwhelmingly the most - while Seoul National University had only 56. Even combining all three prestigious universities called 'SKY' - Seoul National University, Yonsei University (39), and Korea University (32) - they account for only 17%, less than one-fifth of total executives. Regional differences were striking, with 96 executives from Gyeongsang Province schools including Kyungpook National University (63), Pusan National University (14), and Yeungnam University (12), while each Jeolla Province university had only 1-2 graduates. KAIST and Hanyang University, strong in engineering, accounted for significant portions with 55 and 54 executives respectively, while Sungkyunkwan University, in whose foundation management Samsung Group participates, had 58 - the third most after foreign universities and Kyungpook National University.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8501, "output_tokens": 4196, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

However, the Supreme Court continues to harbor suspicious views that prosecutors are deliberately spreading baseless rumors about Chief Justice Lee to the media, creating a subtly evolving conflict. Perhaps conscious of the repercussions his remarks might bring, Chief Justice Lee was cautious with his words when reporters met him on his way to work on the 20th, asking if he believed there were 'forces undermining him,' to which he replied, 'Where are such undermining forces?' and avoided elaborating. The previous day, in an interview with JoongAng Ilbo at church, he said 'There are forces threatening the Chief Justice, who heads the judiciary,' but when asked specifically which group he meant, he said he 'didn't know.' When asked if he intended to disclose his legal representation records, given that he had first mentioned and denied tax evasion allegations, he showed an agitated expression and responded 'The reporters are investigating everything...' as if the question wasn't worth answering. Within the Supreme Court, there's a palpable atmosphere of suspicion that prosecutors, who secured related materials while conducting searches of Korea Exchange Bank, leaked the legal representation records related to Korea Exchange Bank that even Chief Justice Lee Yong-hoon doesn't remember. Prosecutor General Jeong Sang-myeong, who encouraged prosecution staff while hiking last weekend, received questions from reporters on his way to work on the 20th about 'the court taking issue with the prosecution's media play' but headed to his office without any response. From 10 AM that day, prosecutors held a weekly executive meeting chaired by Prosecutor General Jeong to discuss remedial measures regarding media play allegations, the warrant rejection incident, and quasi-appeal issues.\\n\\nSeoul City's New City Hall Rejected by Cultural Heritage Committee for Third Time\\nThe construction of Seoul City's new city hall has been stymied by 'cultural heritage protection' justifications. With the Cultural Heritage Committee rejecting Seoul City's new city hall construction plan three times, groundbreaking within the year has been scrapped and budget losses from design changes are snowballing. There are widespread criticisms that working-level departments are responding carelessly despite the Cultural Heritage Committee making the same demands three times. The two sides have vastly different perspectives on the new city hall. The city argues that 'the new city hall should become a landmark symbolizing Seoul as an international city,' while the Cultural Heritage Committee maintains its position that it 'should harmonize with the historic site Deoksugung Palace.' Regarding the Cultural Heritage Committee's Historic Sites Subcommittee's decision on the 17th to reject the Seoul City new city hall construction plan, Park Cheol-gyu, head of the new city hall expansion promotion team, said, 'After the first rejection, we dramatically changed the building's form and number of floors, but they keep rejecting it consecutively, which is incomprehensible.' In June, when Lee Myung-bak was mayor, Seoul City submitted a 21-story jar-shaped construction plan to the Cultural Heritage Committee, but it was rejected for reasons that 'the scale and form could harm Deoksugung Palace's landscape.' The city then spent 3 billion won [approximately $2.3 million USD] over four months to change the shape to a taegeuk [yin-yang symbol] design and reduce it to 19 stories, reapplying for review last month, but it didn't pass again. After partially changing the exterior design and reapplying this month, it was rejected once more. The Cultural Heritage Committee has consistently pointed out that 'the circular new city hall building is self-centered and the high observatory is intimidating, overshadowing surrounding buildings.'\\n\\n'20% of Book Prices Are Teacher Bribes'\\nIt has been revealed that current school teachers adopted specific publishers' textbooks and reference books as teaching materials for their schools and received hundreds of thousands to millions of won [approximately $750–7,500 USD] from publishers in return. A police official explained that '20% of reference book and textbook prices are provided to teachers as bribes.' The National Police Agency's Special Investigation Division on the 20th filed charges without detention against 30 teachers from 7 high schools, including Kwon (47), for bribery and breach of trust, and 3 people including Kang (45), president of a book distributor who gave money to them, for offering bribes. According to police, Kang and others are suspected of lobbying teachers for textbook adoption since 2002, giving 27 million won [approximately $20,000 USD] over 44 occasions. When teachers adopted textbooks with average unit prices of 4,000–5,000 won [approximately $3–4 USD], they provided 1,000–1,500 won [approximately $0.75–1.15 USD] per student who purchased the books as kickbacks. Police explained that corrupt teachers also pocketed 200,000–5 million won [approximately $150–3,800 USD] in kickbacks when reference books and problem sets other than textbooks were used jointly at schools. A police official said, 'At some schools, teachers who received lobbying from different publishers fought over textbook selection and bribe amounts.' A police official said, 'As of early last year, about 1,500 types of textbooks were published, and lobbying by publishers and book distributors to get them adopted as school materials has become routine.'\\n\\nChairman Kim Geun-tae 'Considering National Audit of Dongtan Profiteering'\\nUri Party Chairman Kim Geun-tae said on the 20th regarding civic groups' allegations that Hwaseong Dongtan New City construction companies made excessive profits of 1 trillion won [approximately $750 million USD] through inflated sale prices, 'While judicial authorities should investigate first, if necessary, we need to consider even a national audit.' At the party's emergency committee meeting that day, Chairman Kim said, 'We will respond with the recognition that real estate speculation is a national disease and an enemy of the Republic of Korea,' adding, 'According to claims by several of our party members and Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice, there was 1.2 trillion won [approximately $900 million USD] in inflated sale prices during the Hwaseong Dongtan New City construction process, and if this is true, it's an outrageous matter.' He said, 'If Hwaseong City knowingly turned a blind eye and construction companies made unjust excessive profits, we must uncover the truth and correct it,' demanding that 'the government should also mobilize public authority to root out real estate speculation.' Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice held a press conference on the 17th claiming that Gyeonggi Hwaseong Dongtan New City construction companies made excessive profits of 1.202 trillion won [approximately $900 million USD] by inflating land costs and construction costs.\\n\\nPresident Roh Visits Cambodia\\nPresident Roh Moo-hyun, on a state visit to Cambodia, said at an overseas Koreans meeting at a Phnom Penh hotel on the 20th, 'In our country, leaders are popular at first, but as time passes, their popularity keeps disappearing.' President Roh said, 'I met with Prime Minister Hun Sen and the National Assembly Speaker and other leaders, and they are all leaders who stood with the people and devoted themselves at risk during times when people were killed and suffered under violent regimes,' adding, 'The leaders of this country are still continuously respected.' This remark is interpreted as expressing regret about some previously respected leaders during Korea's democratization period being disparaged later. It also seems related to President Roh's recent declining public approval ratings. President Roh proudly said, 'We used to live under colonial rule, fight civil war, and live noisily, but when I became president, I found we're supporting about 47 countries,' adding, 'There's no precedent in the world of a formerly colonized country supporting other countries.' President Roh earlier held summit talks with Prime Minister Hun Sen and exchanged opinions on ways to strengthen practical bilateral cooperation in economy and trade, development cooperation, and culture and consular affairs. The Korean government decided to provide a total of 72 million USD [approximately $72 million USD] in grants and loans, including 31 million USD [approximately $31 million USD] for road information network expansion projects and 4 million USD [approximately $4 million USD] to support establishing Cambodia's stock exchange. The two governments signed agreements including a local administrative computerization network construction project implementation agreement, an employment permit workforce dispatch memorandum of understanding, and a diplomatic and official passport visa exemption agreement.\\n\\n[Hankyoreh] 35 Real Estate Agencies in Eunma Apartment Shopping Complex Alone\\nThe recent real estate turmoil is also seriously affecting Korea's economy, which is suffering from economic recession. Business owners and workers are losing motivation, and ordinary people who borrowed money to buy homes are tightening their belts due to interest payments, prolonging the domestic demand slump. Meanwhile, real estate agencies are rapidly increasing and competition rates for real estate departments are soaring, with money and personnel flocking to real estate-related industries. Experts worry that this distorted fever will lead to a decline in our economy's growth potential. According to Korea Licensed Real Estate Agent Association statistics, while the number of real estate agencies nationwide increased by 8,256 over 5 years from 1997, in the following 5 years (2002-September 2006), a whopping 28,031 increased to reach 77,711. In just one building of the Eunma Shopping Complex next to the Eunma Apartments in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Gangnam-gu [an affluent district in Seoul], a symbol of expensive apartments, 35 real estate agencies are located. As housing prices have continued rising for over 5 years, household housing-related loans and interest burdens keep increasing. Recently, money flowing into the stock market is also decreasing. Dr. Kang Kyung-hoon of the Korea Institute of Finance predicted, 'People and funds flocking only to real estate, which is far from expanding growth potential or creating added value, will adversely affect the economy.'\\n\\n[Korea Daily] Where Do 'Presidential Candidates' Spending Over 100 Million Won [approximately $75,000 USD] Monthly Get Funding?\\nThe race among leading presidential candidates targeting the 17th presidential election is gaining momentum. How do presidential candidates cover the enormous costs involved? This is a question currently arising in political circles and academia. Among the 6 leading presidential candidates from ruling and opposition parties, 4 people - former Seoul Mayor Lee Myung-bak, former Prime Minister Goh Kun, former Uri Party Chairman Jeong Dong-young, and former Gyeonggi Governor Son Hak-kyu - are 'unemployed' with no fixed income, excluding current lawmakers Kim Geun-tae, Uri Party Chairman, and former Grand National Party leader Park Geun-hye. Even lawmakers' monthly salary is only about 8.72 million won [approximately $6,500 USD]. However, political sources estimate that the costs presidential candidates and their core staff spend monthly amount to at least 70 million to 140 million won [approximately $52,500–105,000 USD]. Most presidential candidates have established camp offices of 30-95 pyeong [approximately 1,200–3,800 square feet] and have 5-15 full-time staff and employees. Including office operating costs and full-time staff activity expenses, monthly camp operating costs alone amount to about 26 million to 50 million won [approximately $19,500–37,500 USD]. Moreover, costs for presidential candidates' overseas visits or regional tours are analyzed to reach 20 million to 30 million won [approximately $15,000–22,500 USD] monthly.\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Financial Institution Sponsorship Money Used as 'Local Government Head's Pocket Money'\\nLocal governments are using sponsorship money received from treasury operating institutions in exchange for entrusting budgets like pocket money. Jeollabuk-do Province received 50 billion won [approximately $37.5 million USD] in cooperative project costs from Nonghyup [National Agricultural Cooperative Federation], selected as the provincial treasury after agreeing to entrust 1.7 trillion won [approximately $1.3 billion USD] for 2 years in 2004, and has collected 44.7 billion won [approximately $33.5 million USD] so far. However, this money was concentrated on organizations with personal connections to the former governor. Chungcheongnam-do Province's treasury, Nonghyup, paid 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD] in sponsorship money this year alone and handled sales of 150,000 out of 400,000 total advance tickets for the Geumsan Ginseng Expo event. Professor Kim Chang-hwan of Iksan University pointed out, 'Cooperative project funds created with the intention of returning part of the profits from securing provincial treasury to local society are being used like slush funds without budget items,' adding, 'If receiving funds for social return of treasury profits, the amount should be minimized while establishing fund management committees to use them appropriately for purposes like establishing scholarship foundations.'\\n\\n[Kukmin Ilbo] 101 Local Election Winners Face Election Nullification Sentences\\nWith prosecutors facing the statute of limitations expiry for the 4th May 31 Local Elections just 10 days away on the 20th, 101 winners prosecuted for election law violations have been sentenced to election nullification in first trials, making mass re-elections inevitable. According to the Supreme Court and Supreme Prosecutors' Office, 342 winners have been prosecuted for providing money and entertainment, spreading false information, and pre-election campaigning, with 101 out of 266 who completed first trials (37.8%) receiving election nullification sentences, while 76 are still undergoing first trials. Prosecutors plan to continue investigating election crimes until the 6-month statute of limitations expires on the 30th of this month. A Supreme Court official said, 'Since final judgments for 21 metropolitan and basic local government heads pending in the Supreme Court are expected soon, Supreme Court final judgments will continue around year-end and New Year.'\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] Professor Lee Pil-sang Named New Korea University President\\nThe Korea University corporation Korea Central Academy Board of Directors (Chairman Hyeon Seung-jong) held a board meeting on the 20th and unanimously appointed Professor Lee Pil-sang (59) of Business Administration as the new president. With Professor Lee, who graduated from Seoul National University's Department of Metallurgical Engineering, being appointed president, Korea University will have a Seoul National University graduate as president for the first time since its founding. President-designate Lee will be the first non-Korea University graduate to serve as president since the 9th president Kim Jun-yeop (Keio University graduate in Japan), who served until 1985. He competed closely with Professor Lee Ki-soo (61) of Law until the end and will assume the 16th presidency starting next month according to the board's decision. Born in 1947 and from Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, President-designate Lee has high public recognition due to his activities in civic organizations such as Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice.\\n\\n[Chosun Ilbo] Hong Jun-pyo Proposes 'Half-Price Apartment' Bill\\nGrand National Party lawmaker Hong Jun-pyo submitted the 'Special Measures Act for Promoting Supply of Land-Lease Sale Housing' to the National Assembly on the 20th with signatures from over 40 ruling and opposition lawmakers to substantiate the so-called 'half-price apartment' policy he promoted during the Seoul mayoral candidate primary within the party last April. Lawmaker Hong Jun-pyo explained, 'The special measures act proposed this time legislates a new housing supply method that dramatically lowers apartment sale prices by having construction companies sell only buildings during apartment sales while the state, local governments, and public institutions virtually permanently lease land to homeless ordinary people at cost level.' Lawmaker Hong also proposed the 'Korea Land and Housing Corporation Act' that integrates the Korea National Housing Corporation and Korea Land Corporation into the 'Korea Land and Housing Corporation' so these two institutions can be faithful to their original establishment purpose of 'realizing housing welfare by supplying quality housing and land to ordinary people at low prices' rather than pursuing profit.\\n\\n[JoongAng Ilbo] 'Websites Dormant Over 3 Months to Be Eliminated'\\nTens of thousands of homepages with no visitors for long periods or unchanged content will disappear. The Ministry of Information and Communication is conducting a 'Dormant Homepage Cleanup Campaign' from the 20th to December 8th. During this period, the Ministry will investigate domestic internet cafes, blogs, and homepages, cleaning up sites unused for over 3 months. Ministry Information Protection Policy Team Leader Seo Seok-jin explained, 'This is because there are many cases of hackers exploiting long-abandoned homepages for hacking or spreading malicious codes.' The Ministry conducted a first campaign in June this year, eliminating 53,600 homepages.\\n\\nAn institution conducting qualification exams announced plans to invalidate exams where answers were marked and hold re-examinations, but test-takers are rebelling. The Korea Teacher Training Institute, which administered the exam, distributed test papers with underlines beneath correct answers for all 40 questions to test-takers during the Word Level 1 certification course exam held nationwide on the 18th. When test papers with revealed answers were distributed, test-takers reported this to proctors, but they proceeded saying 'Let's take the exam first and then devise measures.' The exam was taken by 82 out of 95 elementary, middle, and high school teachers who applied after paying 60,000 won [approximately $45 USD] tuition for internet distance training. The private training institution Korea Teacher Training Institute called test-takers the next day on the 19th saying 'We will refund tuition and conduct re-examinations next month.'\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8574, "output_tokens": 4226, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

With the ruling party's political reorganization emerging as the biggest issue, the unprecedented move of a sitting president visiting a former president was sufficient to be interpreted as a highly political act, both in terms of situation and format.\\n\\nDuring their two-hour meeting, President Roh and former President Kim expressed agreement that North Korea must be held clearly responsible for violating its denuclearization declaration with the recent nuclear test, and that results must emerge from the six-party talks that will resume soon. First Lady Kwon Yang-sook, former First Lady Lee Hee-ho, and Chief of Staff Lee Byeong-wan also attended this meeting.\\n\\nEarlier, President Roh toured the Kim Dae-jung Library exhibition hall and said \\\"I was moved not only by the touching life journey that former President Kim lived, but also by how well the records of his intense life were collected,\\\" then wrote in the electronic guestbook 'You achieved historical progress through an intense life.'\\n\\nThe Blue House cautioned against political interpretation of the day's meeting, stating \\\"This was to congratulate the opening of the Kim Dae-jung Library exhibition hall, and there was absolutely no mention (regarding political reorganization).\\\" However, analysis is emerging from not only the opposition Grand National Party but even some within the Uri Party that this was \\\"a symbolic move with political reorganization in mind.\\\"\\n\\n**Fair Trade Commission Chairman Kwon Oh-seung: \\\"Samsung Group Should Transition to Holding Company System\\\"**\\n\\nFair Trade Commission Chairman Kwon Oh-seung is drawing attention by specifically naming Samsung Group and Hyundai Motor and urging them to make decisions for governance structure improvement.

The Iraqi High Court handling the 'Dujail Massacre' recognized charges that he ordered the 1982 massacre of 148 Shiite residents in Dujail village and sentenced him to death (execution by hanging) in Hussein's first trial held at a special court in Baghdad's Green Zone on the 5th, according to AP News.\\n\\nHussein's defense team announced they would appeal this verdict. When the death sentence was announced, Hussein shouted \\\"God is great,\\\" \\\"Long live Iraq,\\\" and \\\"Death to Iraq's enemies\\\" before being restrained and dragged out of the courtroom.

The national coastal wetlands area measured by interpreting satellite photos last year was 2,550㎢, a 19.3% decrease since 1987. Coastal wetlands including tidal flats that disappeared due to reclamation projects total 377 cases covering 611㎢.\\n\\nCurrently ongoing reclamation projects also number 267 cases covering 1,044㎢, including 401㎢ of coastal wetlands in the Saemangeum district. Projects that received reclamation permits but haven't begun construction number 9 cases covering 13㎢, while projects that established reclamation plans but haven't received permits yet number 36 cases covering 80㎢, including the Janghang National Industrial Complex construction project that would fill 12㎢ of tidal flats in Seocheon County, South Chungcheong Province.\\n\\n**[Hankook Ilbo] \\\"Let's Create New Party Excluding the President\\\" 49%**\\n\\nAmong Uri Party lawmakers, there are more who believe it would be preferable for President Roh Moo-hyun not to participate rather than participate when creating a pan-ruling party unified new party. Also, an overwhelming majority of lawmakers prefer creating a unified new party.\\n\\nAccording to a phone survey conducted by Hankook Ilbo on the 5th targeting 140 Uri Party members, among 102 respondents, 49% (50 people) answered that 'it would be preferable for President Roh not to participate in the new party,' while 38.2% (39 people) believed 'he should participate.' Lawmakers who reserved answers comprised 12.8% (13 people).\\n\\nThis result suggests the possibility of intensified conflict between pro-Roh and non-Roh factions within the party over President Roh's new party participation during future new party creation discussions, and depending on circumstances, potential party division.\\n\\nRegarding the direction of political reorganization, the opinion that creating a unified new party encompassing the Uri Party, Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Goh Kun, civic groups, and other external reform forces would be preferable was overwhelming at 78.4% (80 people). Responses favoring party remodeling by recruiting some forces to the Uri Party and strengthening identity were only 16.7% (17 people).\\n\\nThis reflects lawmakers' perception that \\\"there is no hope with the current ruling party,\\\" forecasting that future ruling party political reorganization discussions will inevitably flow toward a unified new party. The reason why President Roh exclusion theory is not as prevalent despite the absolute majority supporting unified new party theory is analyzed to be due to judgment that the Yeongnam [southeastern region of Korea] share that President Roh holds should not be abandoned considering the next presidential election.\\n\\n**[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Second-tier Financial Institutions' Housing Collateral Ratios Too High... Exceeding 70% at Most**\\n\\nSome second-tier financial institutions (non-bank financial institutions) including mutual savings banks and installment finance companies have loan-to-value ratios (LTV) reaching the 70% range. Also, non-bank financial institutions' average mortgage loan maturity is much shorter than commercial banks, and the proportion of fixed-rate loans is surprisingly high.\\n\\nAccording to the Bank of Korea's 'Financial Stability Report - Soundness of Non-Bank Sector' released on the 5th, the average LTV of non-bank financial institutions including mutual finance, insurance companies, savings banks, Saemaul Credit Unions, and installment finance companies was in the mid-50% range as of the end of April. However, installment finance companies' LTV exceeded 70%, and savings banks also exceeded 60%.\\n\\n**[Kookmin Ilbo] Employment Permit System 2 Years, Foreign Workers Still Face Human Rights Violations Including Wage Theft**\\n\\nAlthough more than two years have passed since the employment permit system was implemented, illegal act detection cases are increasing more than twofold annually. Jeonju Regional Labor Office inspected 20 companies with many foreign workers in the province through the end of August this year for compliance with labor-related laws including the Labor Standards Act, detecting 42 violations including unpaid severance pay and improper extension of working hours at 17 workplaces, representing 85%.\\n\\nThis is more than triple the 6 workplaces and 13 violations detected in 2004 before the employment permit system was implemented. Additionally, illegal labor practice reports related to foreign workers during the same period surged from 6 cases in 2004 to 14 cases in 2005 and 25 cases this year, more than doubling annually.\\n\\nThe reason illegal labor practices haven't been eradicated even after implementing the employment permit system is interpreted to be that employer representatives still treat foreign workers with social prejudice and wrong perceptions. Another factor is that workers have become more active in seeking their rights, such as immediately reporting unfair labor practices after the system's implementation.\\n\\n**[Dong-A Ilbo] Gangneung University-Wonju University Merger Next March**\\n\\nGangneung University and Wonju University will merge in March next year. The Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development announced on the 5th that it approved a merger plan where national university Gangneung University will integrate national technical college Wonju University and abolish Wonju University, effective March 1, 2007.\\n\\nThese universities' 2007 academic year admission quota will be reduced by 731 students from the current 2,768 to 2,037, selecting new students starting from this year-end regular admissions. Wonju University's Tourism Interpretation and Food Science departments will relocate to the Gangneung campus where Gangneung University is currently located, while the Wonju campus will recruit new students for all other departments except these two.\\n\\nGangneung University plans to specialize the Gangneung campus in marine biology and new materials, and the Wonju campus in medical devices, a strategic industry in the Wonju region, creating a university linked with regional industries.\\n\\n**[Chosun Ilbo] Lee Seung-yeop Signs 4-Year Long-term Contract with Yomiuri**\\n\\nKorea's star hitter Lee Seung-yeop (30) reportedly signed a 4-year long-term contract with Japan's Yomiuri Giants.

Kim left the federal detention center in Los Angeles where he had been held under escort by U.S. Federal Marshal agents in the early morning hours of the 15th (local time), departed for Los Angeles Airport, and was handed over to a prosecution escort team dispatched from Korea. Attorney Erica Kim, Kim's older sister, confirmed in a phone conversation that day, saying \\\"It has been confirmed that my brother left the detention center around 6 a.m. today under escort by Federal Marshal officials.\\\" Kim is expected to board either Korean Air flight KE002 departing at 10:10 a.m. for Narita Airport in Japan or KE018 departing at 11:05 a.m. direct to Incheon from Los Angeles Airport. If Kim and others take these flights, they are scheduled to arrive in Korea around 4-5 p.m. on the 16th. Kim will be escorted to the prosecution for investigation immediately upon arrival in Korea.

Students responded that the Math 'Type A' section, which the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation said was made somewhat difficult, was actually easy. Although hagwons [private academies specializing in test preparation] analyzed that Math 'Type B' was \\\"made difficult,\\\" many students reacted that it was \\\"manageable.\\\" The inquiry sections were generally evaluated as being at last year's level. Admissions experts evaluated that this year's CSAT, which introduced the '9-grade system' for the first time where only grades rather than scores are displayed on report cards, succeeded in overall difficulty adjustment. While there were some challenging questions, it was generally at a similar level to last year. The feared 'grade blank' phenomenon appears unlikely to occur. Students agreed that the language section was difficult, with the number of questions reduced by 10 and test time shortened by 10 minutes this year. Students' reaction to Math 'Type A' was that it was \\\"easy.\\\" Jeong Seong-bong, chair of the question committee (professor at Korea National University of Education), stated, \\\"Overall, we tried to maintain last year's difficulty level, and we made efforts to ensure discrimination by evenly placing easy and difficult problems.\\\"\\n\\nRailway union and freight solidarity postpone joint strike\\nThe railway union and freight solidarity decided to postpone the joint strike they had planned to begin at 4 a.m. on the 16th. Although they held last-minute negotiations with KORAIL (Korea Railroad Corporation) and the Ministry of Construction and Transportation from 2 p.m. on the 15th until around 2 a.m. on the 16th, they failed to find common ground. At around 2:50 a.m. that day, KORAIL President Lee Cheol said, \\\"The union officially notified us of the strike postponement, which is virtually the same as withdrawal,\\\" adding, \\\"This is the result of union members not participating in the leadership's strike declaration.\\\" President Lee also stated firmly, \\\"Negotiations on the unreasonable demands the union has been making will not resume.\\\" The freight solidarity also reportedly reached some agreement on certain issues after holding working-level consultations with the Ministry of Construction and Transportation late into the night.\\n\\nProsecution plays trump card with 'independent investigation team' under special prosecutor and public pressure\\nIn the end, the prosecution raised its hands. Although they said \\\"the credibility of the Samsung 'rice cake money prosecutors' list is low,\\\" the public did not believe it. Lim Chae-jin, the nominee for prosecutor general who was implicated in the allegations, passed the personnel hearing 'conditionally,' but civic groups are shouting 'oppose the appointment.' The prosecution had no choice but to play its trump card by declaring independent investigation and inspection that would include even nominee Lim. The key was securing 'fairness of investigation.' Although it would take more than a month for the political circles to introduce a special prosecutor through procedures such as passing the Special Prosecutor Act, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Special Investigation Department 2, which was assigned the case, could not just sit idle. On the morning of the 15th, nominee Lim personally visited Prosecutor General Jeong Sang-myeong to discuss establishing an independent 'Special Investigation and Inspection Headquarters,' and immediate implementation was decided. This also reflects the internal current that \\\"even if there are rice cake money prosecutors, the 'cutting out one's own flesh' should be done by the prosecution itself, not by outsiders (special prosecutor).\\\" The prosecution is putting all its efforts into securing independence and fairness in establishing the Special Investigation and Inspection Headquarters.\\n\\nGyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong freight train service to begin December 11\\nThe two Koreas have effectively agreed to operate the Gyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong freight train from around December 11. Accordingly, the Gyeongui Line will operate regularly across the two Koreas for the first time in about 56 years since the Seoul-Kaesong train service was suspended on June 12, 1951. Delegations from both sides participating in the 1st Inter-Korean Prime Ministers' Meeting being held in Seoul reached a principled agreement on major matters, including reaching common ground on opening the Gyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong freight train around December 11, as reported on the 15th. A meeting source said, \\\"The South proposed December 11 as the opening date considering various situations in inter-Korean relations, and the North is also accepting it positively, so only final coordination remains.\\\" The Gyeongui Line Munsan-Bongdong train operation was agreed upon by the leaders of both Koreas last month and is expected to be mainly used to transport cargo to and from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. The two Koreas also reportedly agreed to hold the Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Joint Committee with the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs as chief representative in early December and agreed to establish a separate implementation organization for creating the West Sea Peace and Cooperation Special Zone. The two Koreas also decided to dispatch a fact-finding mission to build the Haeju Special Zone and are moving toward holding future working-level consultations based on the judgment that a separate aviation agreement is needed to support Baekdu Mountain tourism. The two Koreas plan to adopt an agreement through a closing meeting on the morning of the 16th after conducting text adjustment work.\\n\\n[Kookmin Ilbo] Hyundai and Kia Motors fined 1.6 billion won [approximately $1.2 million USD] for 'frequent forced price cuts'\\nThe so-called 'supplier price slashing' practice by large corporations has been sanctioned by the Fair Trade Commission for the first time. The Fair Trade Commission announced on the 15th that it discovered Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors engaged in unfair subcontracting practices by unjustly cutting parts prices from suppliers and not paying delay interest, and ordered them to pay fines of 1.69 billion won [approximately $1.27 million USD] each and payments and interest totaling 4.6 billion won [approximately $3.46 million USD]. According to the Fair Trade Commission, Hyundai Motor set a goal to reduce parts material costs by 24.2 billion won [approximately $18.2 million USD] to improve the profitability of the compact car 'Click' in January 2003, and uniformly cut the unit prices of 789 parts from 26 suppliers by 3.4%. Also, from July 2004 to the end of October the following year, while paying suppliers of export car parts 11-956 days later than the legal payment deadline, they did not pay the resulting delay interest of 118 million won [approximately $88,700 USD]. Hyundai Motor paid the delay interest in a lump sum in May last year when the Fair Trade Commission's investigation was underway. Kia Motors verbally agreed with 34 companies making parts for 'Rio' and 'Optima' from June 2003 to the end of 2005 to cut unit prices and later compensate for losses by raising unit prices for 'Sorento' and 'Carnival' parts, but failed to keep this promise. The Fair Trade Commission ordered the company to pay the relevant suppliers 2 billion won [approximately $1.5 million USD] in delay interest in addition to the lowered supply payments. A Hyundai Motor official stated, \\\"The Fair Trade Commission's findings are only some cases among all suppliers, and it is unreasonable to view the reflection of fixed cost reduction effects from increased production volume as uniform supply price cuts,\\\" adding, \\\"We will review the matter after receiving the official decision from the Fair Trade Commission and take legal action.\\\"\\n\\n[Dong-A Ilbo] Foreign language high school teachers create test prep books for hagwons\\nIt was revealed on the 15th that a private hagwon specializing in special purpose high school admissions has been having current teachers from foreign language high schools in the Seoul area create expected test questions for foreign language high school admissions and making them into test prep books to sell to students. This hagwon is a hagwon education company that holds the largest stake in Seoul Mokdong Jongno M Academy, which recently stole admission questions from Gimpo Foreign Language High School. Haneul Education Co., which promotes itself as a 'specialized admissions institution for special purpose high schools,' has been publishing 'Foreign Language High School Preparation Oral Interview Question Books' monthly since April, featuring English listening, language, and critical thinking questions created by 10 current foreign language high school teachers in the Seoul area. The hagwon advertised these as \\\"problems directly developed by current foreign language high school teachers with experience as joint question committee members for foreign language high school admissions\\\" and \\\"exclusively published by our company.\\\" The preface of the question book states \\\"question types actually used in 6 foreign language high schools in Seoul and foreign language high schools in the Gyeonggi area,\\\" and clearly indicates that each question was created by current foreign language high school teachers. Yoon Seok-won, director of Haneul Education's Materials Research Institute, said, \\\"A total of 10 current foreign language high school teachers in the Seoul area participated in question creation: 4 in English, 3 in mathematics, 2 in Korean, and 1 in social studies.\\\" Haneul Education stated, \\\"We asked current foreign language high school teachers to create the question book with the intention of allowing students preparing for special purpose high schools to encounter proper types of practical questions.\\\"\\n\\n[Chosun Ilbo] Getting harder to find jeonse [housing rental system where tenants pay a large lump sum deposit instead of monthly rent] under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD]\\nThe number of apartments available for jeonse under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] has significantly decreased in the Seoul metropolitan area including Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon. According to real estate information company 'Real Estate Bank' on the 15th, among 3,028,778 apartment units in the metropolitan area, apartments available for jeonse under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] numbered 1,183,026 units (as of November 14), a decrease of 120,478 units (9.24%) over the past year. The decrease was particularly notable in the relatively low jeonse price Gangbuk [northern Seoul] area, which saw a reduction of 30,796 units. Gil Jin-hong, team leader at 'Real Estate Bank,' said, \\\"As housing prices rose significantly last year, demand for jeonse increased more than demand for home purchases, and jeonse prices also rose as housing prices for small and medium-sized apartments in non-Gangnam [areas outside the affluent Gangnam district in Seoul] areas soared,\\\" adding, \\\"This trend will continue for the time being, and the number of apartments under 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] jeonse will decrease further.\\\"\\n\\n[JoongAng Ilbo] Yeongdeungpo Prison moves after 61 years\\nYeongdeungpo Prison located in Gocheok-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul will be relocated to a greenbelt area in Cheonwang-dong, 3km away, by December 2010. Minister of Justice Jeong Seong-jin and Guro District Mayor Yang Dae-woong signed a 'memorandum of agreement on the relocation and new construction project of Yeongdeungpo correctional facilities' on the 15th. When the need for reconstruction arose due to the deteriorating facilities of Yeongdeungpo Prison, Guro District Office proposed to the Ministry of Justice to relocate the prison to the outskirts. Currently, apartments are built around Yeongdeungpo Prison with only a 12m road between them, and residents have been demanding the prison's relocation.\\n\\n[Hankyoreh] Supreme Court remands Kim Tae-hwan Jeju Governor's election law violation case... maintains governorship\\nThe Supreme Court en banc (presiding Justice Park Il-hwan) on the 15th overturned the lower court's sentence of a 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD] fine and remanded the case to Gwangju High Court for \\\"retrial\\\" in the appeal of Jeju Province Governor Kim Tae-hwan (65), who was indicted on charges of conspiring with Jeju Provincial Government officials to plan election campaigns before last year's May 31 local elections (violation of the Public Official Election Act). As a result, Governor Kim will be able to maintain his position as Jeju Province Governor for the time being. The court stated in its ruling, \\\"Evidence collected in violation of search and seizure procedures stipulated by the Constitution and Criminal Procedure Act during the investigation cannot be used as evidence for finding guilt; however, evidence capability may be recognized when necessary to clarify substantial truth.\\\" Governor Kim was indicted on charges of planning election campaigns by mobilizing public officials, including receiving reports from Jeju Provincial Government employee Hyeon and two others, as well as his cousin, about candidate lists for regional representatives in preparation for local elections and 'regional and occupational special management supervisor status' based on these lists in February last year. Until now, Supreme Court precedents have recognized evidence capability without exception for non-testimonial evidence such as documents, even if collected through illegal methods.\\n\\n[Hankook Ilbo] Representative Kang Jae-seop: \\\"Baek Il-seop's strange remarks regrettable\\\"\\nGrand National Party Representative Kang Jae-seop expressed regret on the 15th regarding actor Baek Il-seop's remarks at a party-hosted event on the 14th about former party leader Lee Hoi-chang's candidacy, saying, \\\"Regardless of party politics, even among friends, betrayal is not right. (Former leader Lee) should not wander the night streets before getting beaten to death.\\\" Representative Kang stated at the supreme council meeting that day, \\\"A certain actor came out and made strange remarks, which have absolutely nothing to do with our party and were individual impulsive actions,\\\" adding, \\\"If such remarks hurt former leader Lee's feelings, it is wrong for the party. We consider it regrettable.\\\" Regarding this, former leader Lee told reporters that day, \\\"Haven't all kinds of criticism, condemnation, and abuse been poured on me from the beginning?\\\" adding, \\\"I don't pay much attention to ordinary abuse.\\\"\\n\\n[Kyunghyang Shinmun] Unification Ministry official extorts 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD], passes tourism costs to companies\\nA Unification Ministry official who demanded bribes from companies and had companies run by acquaintances mobilize to raise bribe money has been arrested by prosecutors. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Special Investigation Department 3 (Chief Prosecutor Lee Myung-jae) arrested Unification Ministry official Yoon (42) on the 15th on charges of receiving hundreds of millions of won in bribes from companies in connection with the government's inter-Korean land transportation system improvement project. Yoon, who worked in the Unification Ministry's inter-Korean economic cooperation team and was in charge of North Korea-related projects, demanded bribes from Company O, a system development and installation company, saying, \\\"I will provide administrative support and various conveniences for business promotion.\\\" Company O paid a total of 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] to Yoon in five installments from August last year to April this year by manipulating accounting books to make it appear they paid labor costs even though they had not actually signed labor supply contracts with subcontractors. Yoon arranged Mount Kumgang tours for graduate school professors who reviewed his doctoral dissertation, received a 50% discount from the tour company, and forced Company O to pay the remaining 50% cost of 6 million won [approximately $4,500 USD]. Yoon, who had worked in the information and communications industry, was specially recruited as a technical civil servant by the Unification Ministry in November 2004 and has reportedly worked in the inter-Korean economic cooperation field since then.\\n\\nAdditional note\\nJob portal Jobkorea surveyed 1,042 office workers from October 25 to November 9 about 'office worker impatience syndrome status,' and found that 78.2% answered they are 'currently suffering from impatience syndrome,' showing that 8 out of 10 office workers suffer from 'hurry-hurry syndrome.' The proportion of those who think they have impatience syndrome was higher among female workers (85.1%) than males (75.9%), with those in their 20s (79.9%) and 40s (67.2%) following. When asked why they have impatience syndrome, the response rate for 'because I feel anxious if I don't handle work quickly' was highest at 55.1%, followed by: thinking of other work while working and being unable to concentrate (46.0%), always living pressed for time (40.4%), feeling anxious for no reason (33.3%), and being restless alone when there is work (31.7%).\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8387, "output_tokens": 4396, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

For citizens, the most pressing issues are how much their children's school fees will increase and what housing prices are like. According to a survey conducted November 21-22 targeting 1,000 adult men and women nationwide regarding the most urgent livelihood issues the president should address, the results were: 4th place - reducing educational cost burden (12.4%), 3rd place - stabilizing real estate including housing prices (12.6%), 2nd place - stabilizing prices including oil prices (24.9%), 1st place - resolving unemployment through job creation (33.6%). The president seems to have set next year's economic growth forecast at 4-5%, and the Korea Development Institute projects 5.5%. Economic indicators are improving, but ordinary people don't feel it. When might the economic sentiment improve for ordinary citizens? ▲I'm thinking a lot about this exact point. Economic growth is recovering fastest among OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries right now, and it's expected to be the highest next year as well, so the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and OECD say it will be 4.5%. I expect it will be revised slightly upward by year-end. I think next year's economy will be around 5%. However, looking at various indicators, some say we need exit strategies, but I disagree. Even though our economic numbers look good and we're leading among OECD countries, there are many variables in the global economy. Problems arose in Dubai, and if any developed country experiences a financial crisis, the ripple effects will reach us immediately. If the global economy weakens, we won't be able to sell our products. We can't predict how much oil and gas prices will rise. They say oil prices will be around $80 next year, but I think they'll go up to $100. External forecasts also suggest around 5%. Companies and small businesses feel it first. For ordinary people's sentiment, it will probably take until the first half of next year. In the first half, we'll restart the so-called Hope Work projects from February and resume internships. Youth unemployment is slightly over 8% now. In the US and Europe, it's nearly 20%. While we're better than developed countries, the government's immediate task is how to create jobs. When the economic growth rate improves, corporate investment will begin, and domestic demand is recovering somewhat faster than the government predicted, so things will probably improve somewhat. But the government is focusing on leading the creation of good jobs among ordinary people's measures and job creation. Because small businesses can't find 200,000 people. How do we match job seekers with employers? When there's a mismatch, the government is making specific plans for retraining and customized training. Since we've become a country that provides aid, when we transfer our experience overseas, 20,000 young people will go abroad annually. We're focusing support on small businesses and startups. Because of the government's efforts to create opportunities for young people, people will be able to feel the effects in the second half. [Image enlargement] -- You said the economy will smoothly reach about 5% growth next year and recovered quickly without major damage compared to the global financial crisis, but many question whether our economy's fundamentals are recovering. I understand there are many concerns about side effects if we rely on short-term stimulus without fundamental improvements. What's your perspective? ▲In fact, through the first half and third quarter, we've relied heavily on government fiscal spending. To continue growing, private corporate investment must follow. That's how demand is created. I was very worried entering the fourth quarter. We thought it would go into negative growth, but fortunately it was positive growth. Looking at the content, private investment began much better than we worried about in the third quarter, and private consumption is also increasing slightly. Because household savings are very weak, there's an issue with savings. Can companies continue to activate investment in the fourth quarter? Companies must see investment value - they don't invest just because the government tells them to. Listening to business groups, companies were passive about investment in the second quarter but are being proactive by the end of the fourth quarter. We're closely monitoring fundamentals, private investment, consumption, savings, etc. Foreign countries evaluate Korea as doing well. By 2014-2015, fiscal deficits will reverse and become surpluses. The government is monitoring very closely and hasn't disbanded the emergency economic response committee yet. Our view is that exit measures should be implemented more slowly. [Image enlargement] -- What you did well was hosting the G20 summit, and what you did poorly was tax cuts for the rich. ▲Since becoming president, I'm misunderstood as being pro-big business and pro-rich, but ultimately, I'm instinctively not that way. Big companies must do well to create jobs. You could say I'm pro-market, but I'm pro-jobs. Tax cuts create jobs. 65% of tax cut benefits go to small businesses. Calling this policy for the rich is a misunderstanding. It's frustrating, but I have firm convictions. (Tax cuts) create jobs and stimulate domestic demand, I believe. -- You mentioned the MISO Foundation as an example of pro-ordinary people policy, but there are concerns about moral hazard if people just take money without doing business and don't repay. ▲While this is part of ordinary people's policy, those suffering most are traditional market vendors and street vendors - these people can't access financial services. This doesn't apply to small business owners; street vendors don't get proper benefits. When urgent, they use private loans of 1 million won [approximately $760 USD] or 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD] and it grows to 10 times the principal. The foreign term is microcredit. We called it MISO because we liked the name. Large corporations and financial institutions voluntarily contributed 1.3 trillion won [approximately $990 million USD] and companies do it themselves. Each company contributes a certain amount, providing as little as 3 million won [approximately $2,280 USD], 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD], up to 10 million won [approximately $7,600 USD] in some places. We haven't been doing this long, but many people say the intent is good but ask about moral hazard. Two weeks ago at an event, an elderly woman wanted to meet me, but security wouldn't allow it, so I brought her over. She was making fish-shaped pastries in Jongno but couldn't continue because she lacked 3 million won [approximately $2,280 USD]. She borrowed 3 million won [approximately $2,280 USD] to make fish-shaped pastries again and came to thank me. She said she'd only used private loans her whole life - this was her first time getting low-interest financing. She said what she wants to do now is give fish-shaped pastries to poor people who could only watch without being able to buy them in the past, since she received the nation's help. I was moved. I tell people who talk about moral hazard: People who borrow 3 million won [approximately $2,280 USD] or 5 million won [approximately $3,800 USD] will never default. They might repay late, but they'll repay. However, people who take 5 billion won [approximately $3.8 million USD] or 10 billion won [approximately $7.6 million USD] sometimes default. I'm confident that people who borrow 3-5 million won [approximately $2,280-3,800 USD] will repay, so this system should be expanded. Participating companies and financial institutions have 700-800 billion won [approximately $530-610 million USD] remaining, so we'll probably create nearly 2 trillion won [approximately $1.5 billion USD] in MISO financing for loans.

[Image enlargement] -- (Citizen) I'm approaching graduation and trying hard to find employment, but it's difficult. You mentioned venture startups to resolve youth unemployment, but startups realistically have few success stories and are difficult. The reality is that the income, welfare, and standards we hope for fall short, so rather than just telling us to lower our expectations, wouldn't it be right to present fundamental solutions? ▲Many people say to lower expectations, but I don't use those words. I felt bad when I heard that when I was young. Don't lower them, match them. Going to big companies often means doing predetermined work and repeating the same tasks. Small businesses might be disappointing, but the scope is broader with more to experience. They hire new employees but nowadays they all hire experienced workers. In such cases, you can gain experience at small businesses and move to other companies. Small business owners say salaries are decent but young people don't apply. Many young people's majors don't match, so the government provides education for that. There are 6-month to 1-year courses nationwide where you can receive free education with 600,000-1 million won [approximately $460-760 USD] support. Ventures literally require taking challenges. You might fail, but don't fear failure. If you fear failure and do nothing, you can't gain experience. Through failure, you can also gain experience and mature. I actually joined a small company. That small company later became a large company, but people asked why I was going to such a company. Still, I found fulfillment at the small company and experienced growing as the company grew. I'm saying to look at small companies too. Aren't service industries good jobs? 40-50 are created, but manufacturing creates less than 10. We'll foster service industries so many young people can enter them. -- I'm a company employee in my 30s. I tried to apply for special sales of Bogeumjari housing for newlyweds, but couldn't apply because I don't have children. Friends also give up applications due to strict conditions. You emphasize residential stability for ordinary people - could you provide comprehensive measures for ordinary people? ▲After getting married, I moved 8 times in 3 years. I was kicked out every 6 months. Later I went to a 20-pyeong [approximately 660 sq ft] apartment and had four children. I promised to create long-term rental and sales apartments that can be used for 10-20+ years near downtown, close to workplaces, and give priority to people who worked their whole lives but couldn't own homes, even if they're not newlyweds. When trying to implement the policy, suddenly many people got married and many newlyweds appeared, making it unmanageable. But I can't investigate pregnancies. We're taking measures to accommodate people who say they're pregnant, and Bogeumjari housing doesn't come out just once but twice a year. The government is considering giving the same opportunities to those who are definitely pregnant. But speculation and selling shouldn't happen. Since they're very cheap, new green buildings with low management costs and high-quality construction, I hope there's no speculation. [Image enlargement] -- In the past, there were many kidnappings so parents worried a lot. Now with the 'Cho Doo-soon case' and others, parents with daughters are uneasy. As parents, we worry about preventing repeat offenses and whether we can safely send children outside. ▲It's truly bewildering. We talk about becoming a first-class nation and developed country, but you don't become developed just by increasing income. You become developed when things like child sex crimes disappear and people can live comfortably. Among all crimes, I think child sex crimes are the most immoral. Child sex offenders should be isolated from society for life. In our country, sentences for drug offenders and child sex offenders are lower than in other developed countries. We should raise these and establish government measures so wherever these people move, everyone knows what kind of people they are, making it impossible for them to establish themselves. We should eliminate such heinous criminals and create 'caregivers' for children going to school, where neighborhood grandmothers take them and mothers with time take turns caring for other children and their own. -- My ideal type is a woman who cooks well. While watching TV, I saw news on American CNN where First Lady Kim Yoon-ok introduced our food. Does First Lady Kim actually cook well, and does the president occasionally cook too? ▲I don't cook well. I haven't had opportunities to cook, but I make good ramen. My wife is probably watching TV now. I should say she cooks well - what good would it do to say she doesn't? My wife makes excellent chicken gangjeong. She's interested in cooking, but following the Korean Wave, let's spread Korean food globally as healthy food, so the Korean Wave spreads food culture along with arts and culture. -- One of my children is a university student but went as a police auxiliary, which was a relief, but during middle and high school, I thought my back would break from hagwon education [private tutoring] costs. They say if you don't go into debt in middle school, you're fortunate. Every time the president announces hagwon education cost reduction measures, there's the strange phenomenon of hagwon education costs rising. Are there hagwon education cost reduction measures? ▲Education can be called Korea's chronic disease. For 30 years, we've talked about equalized education, but people still send children to hagwon education because university admissions can't be equalized, so people have no choice but to receive hagwon education. The university admission system must change. Shouldn't it disappear if we say you can get in without receiving hagwon education? Instead of selecting by grades, if someone scores 90 with hagwon education and someone scores 80 without hagwon education, the university should accept the 80-point scorer. This evaluates that if this person had received hagwon education, they would have scored more than 90 - they have potential. It's comprehensive evaluation including how well they cooperate with friends, social awareness, family awareness, etc. When Korean students apply to top American universities, don't they evaluate by sending records? Now several universities like KAIST and POSTECH select 100% through admissions officers' interviews. Since Seoul National University and all universities are gradually using admissions officers, don't just study. You can't adapt in the world by just memorizing and cramming like before. You need creativity. You need the ability to cooperate with others and leadership. Elementary and secondary education should also be more free, not focused on memorization and grades. Children should be healthy and play sports too. Reviving public education has been discussed for a long time. School grades are announced, aren't they? Teachers also have good and bad teachers who continue as is, but now let's evaluate teachers too. Let inadequate teachers receive retraining. That's how public education can be revived. For truly necessary hagwon education and supplementary lessons, we must completely transform EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] to the same level as going to top hagwons. Many people already use it. We're really trying to change things. -- Are you healthy? I wear long underwear in cold winter. I heard the president also wears long underwear - it's not because you're cold like me, right? ▲Once I started wearing it, it became a habit and it's good. Green growth isn't grandiose - just think about what each citizen can do. By wearing long underwear, the Blue House temperature dropped 3 degrees. Energy was reduced 20% and 2 trillion won [approximately $1.5 billion USD] was saved. Carbon emissions also decreased. No other country in the world takes off clothes at home like ours. I hope Korea does this too from the perspective of carbon emission reduction and energy conservation. I can't tell others to wear it, so only I wear it. So naturally the Blue House wears it too.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10349, "output_tokens": 4318, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He's a teenager, and I really wanted to see him. So today on Joo Young-jin's News Briefing, we worked hard to arrange this and succeeded in having him here. Please come in.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Hello.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Viewers, you just saw who this is in the video clip, so you know, right? Kim Ji-myeong, a third-year student at Seoul Seondeok High School. He's the protagonist who has become a hot topic for overcoming leukemia and receiving a perfect score on this year's CSAT. How do you feel, Ji-myeong?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I'm really bewildered, and I actually didn't expect to get a perfect score, but I feel very happy and proud.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And you've done many newspaper interviews and appeared on broadcast programs like this today, so you must feel even more hectic and bewildered.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I'm very nervous.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Nervous? Please don't be nervous at all. Today I just want to hear Ji-myeong's story comfortably. While the part about Ji-myeong getting a perfect CSAT score is noteworthy, I think many people are showing great interest and are quite surprised about the fact that he overcame leukemia. You're in very good health now, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes, I received a complete recovery diagnosis in March of my first year of high school, so I'm living healthily now.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: How many years did you fight leukemia?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: From my first year of middle school to my third year, I think I received treatment for a little over three years.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: There's a photo showing on screen now—is that from first year? Middle school then? The caption is wrong right now. You received the complete recovery diagnosis in March of your first year of high school, right?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Right? The photos showing on screen now are from middle school, the photos currently being shown.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes, from middle school.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: With your head shaved like that, and I saw earlier what looked like a photo of you receiving a scholarship at some temple. Where is that place in the current screen?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: That's a temple called Jeonggaksa. They have an activity there where they provide support funds for children suffering from pediatric cancers like leukemia and other blood cancers. I received about 3 million won [approximately $2,250 USD] in support funds from there. So my mother and I always thought that we should give back more than what we received. The scholarship wasn't from there—I was taking online courses, and that online course site gives corresponding scholarships when you achieve certain goals or grades. So I donated that scholarship money back to Jeonggaksa.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You promised with your mother to definitely give back as much as you received, or more. And you kept that promise.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: She always says that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Your mother?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: That you must give back as much as you receive. Your mother always said that.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: She often does that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And Ji-myeong also agreed with your mother's words and worked to keep that promise, and you kept it. This is absolutely not an easy thing to do. Keeping such a promise itself is never easy, but Ji-myeong, you accomplished it. But about these online courses—for our viewers who might not be familiar—what kind of lectures are online courses?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: It's short for internet lectures.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Short for internet lectures.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Instead of going directly to a hagwon to listen to classes from teachers who are physically there, there are lectures filmed and available on the internet. You listen to those lectures, so you think of it as having a virtual teacher. That's how you take classes and study using online courses.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You got leukemia. Ji-myeong must have had a really hard time—you must have been in a lot of pain and suffered a lot. Looking back, could you tell us how difficult those three years were?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: They were simply the most difficult three years of my life, but also through that process, I matured a lot, and I have many thoughts when I think about that time.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Many people think leukemia is not an easy disease to overcome. But when you got leukemia and your body was really struggling and in pain, did you have confidence during that process that 'I won't lose to this disease'?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: On the first day, I actually didn't know exactly what kind of disease leukemia was. But just from the sound of it, it seemed like a very serious and dangerous disease, so when I was diagnosed with leukemia, my mother and I cried a lot. I also thought, 'Am I going to die?' But then the doctors talked to me and gave me faith. Blood cancer is an area where many treatment methods have been developed among various cancers, and they said that because my prognosis was relatively good, I could be completely cured with just chemotherapy without a bone marrow transplant. So I believed that and followed through, which is probably why I could be completely cured.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Studying in middle school must have been a bit difficult. It must have been very difficult.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I often left school early, so I missed a lot of school classes. That's why I used online courses to supplement that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So we can see that Ji-myeong studied a lot through internet lectures. From third year of middle school, you had to go to high school. There wasn't a gap with your peers or anything like that, right? You progressed to high school together with everyone else?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: That itself seems amazing. Even though you were receiving treatment and missed a lot of school, you graduated together with your friends.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: My middle school friends helped me a lot. I was really grateful. Because I was sick, my homeroom teacher in first year asked the kids if they could excuse me from cleaning duties and such, and all the kids agreed and were very considerate of me.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Your friends were very considerate. Do you still meet and keep in touch with your middle school friends?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I haven't met them yet, but there are friends I keep in touch with.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: There are friends you keep in touch with. With such grateful friends, you got through your third year of middle school well and entered high school. The high school isn't a regular high school either—I saw in the article that it's an autonomous private high school?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: To get into an autonomous private high school, you must have studied very well in middle school too. How was it?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I did well.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Even while fighting leukemia, Ji-myeong studied well. But when you came to high school and received the complete recovery diagnosis, how did you feel then?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Actually, this leukemia treatment lasts three years, right? The first year is the most difficult, and the difficulty gradually decreases because the medication dosage decreases. So during my middle school three years, I think I lived almost like a completely recovered person. So when I received the complete recovery diagnosis in March of my first year of high school, I just thought, 'Finally, I don't have to get chemotherapy at the hospital anymore, it's over.' It felt refreshing and like I had shaken off everything.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Didn't you and your mother hold hands and cry from joy when you heard the complete recovery diagnosis?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I don't remember if my mother cried or not, but I had been living quite healthily before that, so I didn't really cry like that.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Is Ji-myeong basically somewhat optimistic? Do you tend to be optimistic about the world?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Everyone says so.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: I was really surprised by what you said earlier, when you said 'Even when fighting leukemia, I lived like a healthy person.' Ji-myeong's natural disposition probably helped him focus on studying. Actually, viewers, we can call Kim Ji-myeong a student who got a perfect CSAT score and a student who overcame leukemia—it wouldn't be excessive to call him a protagonist of human triumph. But we actually don't know Ji-myeong well. We heard from people around him about what kind of student and person Ji-myeong is. This is probably a story Ji-myeong hasn't heard yet, so shall we listen together?\\n\\n# VCR\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Did you expect Monk Jeongmok to say that?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I didn't even know he was interviewed.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: But that story really shows what kind of student Ji-myeong is. The monk also said it was the first case of keeping that promise. So the monk was also surprised. I heard that becoming a doctor is your dream. Did you start thinking 'I should become a doctor when I grow up' from when you were fighting that illness?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I was thinking that then.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And do you still cherish that dream now?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Since I only studied in high school, I haven't seriously considered my career path much. But I have to write essays, and everyone around me recommends medical school, and because I have that experience, I have the desire to treat people, so I am considering a medical career for now.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: A medical career. Even among doctors, there are various fields. Have you thought about what kind of doctor you'd like to become?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: The leukemia I was treated for is a disease handled by hematology-oncology. So while I was in the hospital ward and going to the hospital, I saw many people suffering from the same type of diseases as me, and because I was also sick, I think I'll probably choose hematology-oncology as my career path.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: How did you study?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I used online courses and school classes—first I'd listen to classes, then during self-study time I'd review again or preview online courses.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Did you listen to internet lectures at home, not at school?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So what time did you usually get home?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: School ends at 10:30, so including travel time, I get home around 11:10.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: So after listening to internet lectures, what time did you go to bed?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Between 12 and 1 o'clock.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Between 12 and 1 o'clock.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: That was in my senior year. In my first and second years of high school, I just went straight to bed when I got home.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: What time did you wake up in the morning?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Around 6:20.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Around 6:20. So your daily sleep was about 6 hours, 5 hours or so.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Sometimes 6 to 7 hours.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Did you never nap during the day?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I did sleep during break times or lunch time.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: I think your mother might be the protagonist who created today's Ji-myeong, from what I saw in the articles. Do you also think your mother is the most grateful person in the world?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes. She suffered the most because of me, and she was a great source of strength when I was receiving treatment. Throughout middle school and high school, my mother worked harder than me to find information about my advancement to higher education and college admissions, remembering and organizing it all. Also, in my senior year of high school, my mother told me that I was the greatest gift in her life, which really moved me.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: To Ji-myeong. Your mother said 'Our Ji-myeong is the greatest gift to mom,' right? I heard that your mother doesn't just do housework and take care of Ji-myeong, but also runs a separate business.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: You're running a restaurant?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Yes, yes.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Is it a big restaurant?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I thought it was big, but my mother says it's not that big of a restaurant.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Ji-myeong, you probably didn't have time to go help your mother because you were studying.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Right.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: I heard there's a big banner hung in front of your mother's restaurant. I wonder if there are photos. The school teachers put up a big banner at your mother's restaurant to congratulate Ji-myeong. What does it say?\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: I think it said 'Congratulations 2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer.'\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Getting a perfect CSAT score, overcoming illness—this might be the best time in Ji-myeong's life right now. But this time will also pass, won't it? Then Ji-myeong will have to enter the university he wants and study there. You appeared on Joo Young-jin's News Briefing today, and many people will be watching Ji-myeong from now on. Even if they forget briefly, when Ji-myeong appears in the world again later, they'll think 'that's that student.' Having appeared on Joo Young-jin's News Briefing today, could you tell our mother, teachers, friends, and viewers who don't know Ji-myeong: 'This is the kind of person I will become'? I really want to hear it. Or you could just speak to your mother if you prefer.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: If I choose a medical career path, the biggest driving force that allowed me to continue following such difficult treatment was my faith in the doctors. So if I ever treat patients, I want to become someone who can give patients faith and plant hope for treatment in them.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: And could you also say a word to the friends and teachers who helped you? Take this opportunity.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: First, I'm most grateful to my mother. And also to the doctors, nurses, and all the medical staff at Seoul National University Hospital who treated me when I was sick, and the doctors who were my attending physicians. I'm very grateful. And because I was sick and often absent, other friends in middle school had to work harder to make up for what I couldn't do, and I'm so grateful that they endured and were considerate. And I'm grateful to so many people.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Looking at Ji-myeong, I get the impression that he's very humble and especially someone who never forgets gratitude. When I read the articles, I also saw one where your mother said there were many people in the world to be grateful for. And as Ji-myeong said earlier, the promise with your mother that you must give back what you receive—I hope Ji-myeong continues to be someone who keeps that promise. Most importantly, stay healthy.\\n\\n▶ Kim Ji-myeong/2019 CSAT Perfect Scorer: Thank you.\\n\\n▷ Joo Young-jin/Anchor: Thank you for coming today. How did you find this interview with Kim Ji-myeong, viewers? I saw hope for the future in this young student who overcame illness and diligently fulfilled his duty of studying hard. I look forward to Ji-myeong living a life where he achieves what he hopes for. I also hope he becomes a doctor who can give faith to others.
