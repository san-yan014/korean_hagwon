Inchon Kim Seong-su is one of them.\\n\\nAmidst this situation, an article by Lee Cheol-seung, Representative Standing Chairman of the Liberal Democratic National Conference, detailing Inchon's activities around liberation, particularly the circumstances surrounding the student soldier issue at that time, has been published in Monthly Chosun and is drawing attention.\\n\\nThis article titled 'Lee Cheol-seung's Memories' is introduced in its original form. <Editor's Note>\\n\\nLee Cheol-seung's Memories\\n\\n▽Meeting a Leader of the Nation▽\\n\\nBorn in an anti-Japanese family, from my days at Jeonju Bukjung [Jeonju North Middle School, predecessor of Jeonju High School], I did not undergo the Japanese-imposed name change [creating Japanese-style names], did not speak the 'national language' (Japanese), and beat up Japanese students who discriminated against Koreans, receiving home detention or suspension, ultimately failing the second year.\\n\\nIn 1942, during my fifth-year graduation class, I caused an incident by throwing a Japanese teacher named Noda to the classroom floor after he said 'Hangeul is a code used by savages' and extremely despised Koreans. Branded as an unruly Korean student, I became unable to pursue Japanese study abroad or enter government/public professional colleges, which were perceived as paths to success.\\n\\nMy uncle Lee Seok-ju (a member of the Constitutional Assembly) advised: 'If you go to Japan for study or enter government/public schools, with your bad ideology you'll easily spend your life repeatedly in prison or fall into becoming a delinquent. Therefore, enroll in Bosung Professional School [predecessor of Korea University], a national school established by our own strength, under the leadership of our nation's leader.' Following this advice, I entered Bosung Professional School. At that time, Inchon Kim Seong-su was serving as principal, so I came to serve the teacher closely.\\n\\nInchon graduated from Waseda University in Japan in 1914 and, with the belief in 'nation-building through education' that many talented people must be cultivated for the indefinite independence of the homeland, took over Jungang School [predecessor of Jungang High School] and became principal in 1917. In 1932, when Bosung Professional School, established by Lee Yong-ik in 1905, faced financial difficulties, he took it over and became principal. Whenever I visit my alma mater, I recall the image of Inchon wearing a straw hat and pulling weeds on the lawn beneath what is now Korea University's Inchon statue.\\n\\n▽Inchon Never Encouraged Student Soldier Volunteering▽\\n\\nAt that time, Bosung Professional had Principal Kim Seong-su from the nationalist camp, along with Jang Deok-su, Ahn Ho-sang, Yu Jin-o, Jin Seung-rok, and Son Jin-tae, as well as Yun Haeng-jung, Park Geuk-chae, and Choi Yong-dal from the socialist camp.\\n\\nThough they differed in ideology, under Inchon these people cooperated in anti-Japanese activities without conflict, nurturing the younger generation and planting and cultivating seeds of independent liberation. After liberation, they immediately split into left and right-wing camp leaders, playing leading roles in their respective camps. At that time and place, our Bosung Professional was like 'a hometown for young people filled with the fragrance of the nation.'\\n\\nThere is one anecdote to introduce here. In 1930, Inchon visited his father Kim Gyeong-jung in his hometown of Gochang, North Jeolla Province, and recommended the takeover of Bosung Professional several times, but his father refused each time. Following the advice of Song Jin-u and Baek Gwan-su, Inchon decided to bring his father to Seoul unconditionally and had Jungang High School students and Bosung Professional students give a grand welcome at Seoul Station platform.\\n\\nWhen Kim arrived at Seoul Station, there was a grand welcome by Jungang High School students and some Bosung Professional students. Kim was surprised but also showed a satisfied expression. Kim then agreed to the takeover of the financially troubled Bosung Professional and contributed enormous wealth to make the Bosung Professional takeover possible.\\n\\nWhen the Student Volunteer System was implemented on October 20, 1943, the Government-General of Korea mobilized police, military police, and other administrative agencies at all levels of professional college authorities to force student soldier volunteering. When their volunteering results were poor, they mobilized leading figures to force student soldier encouragement. Choi Nam-seon and Lee Gwang-su encouraged student soldier volunteering not only domestically but even went to Tokyo, Japan, and Yun Chi-ho encouraged by saying 'A glorious path has opened for Korean students to stand shoulder to shoulder with Japanese compatriots and go to the battlefield.'\\n\\nWhat was Inchon's position in this situation? Despite Japanese pressure, Inchon said, 'I was entrusted with their education, not to tell them to go or not go to the battlefield.' However, a reporter from the Government-General organ 'Maeil Sinbo' published an article selling Inchon's name without permission to flatter the Japanese. Later, when I was dragged away as a student soldier, I never heard Inchon tell us we should go as student soldiers until the day we departed.\\n\\nGoha Song Jin-u, who was Inchon's close friend and president of Dong-A Ilbo at the time, also completely avoided student soldier encouragement campaigns, using illness treatment as an excuse.\\n\\nOne day when I visited Inchon, Song said, 'The Japanese rushing student soldier volunteering is evidence that the war situation is that unfavorable for them. It seems they want to use this opportunity to eliminate the educated Korean seeds. Act wisely.' So I decided to conduct a student soldier refusal movement nationwide during winter vacation.\\n\\nOn another day, when I visited Professor Ahn Ho-sang, who was hospitalized feigning illness, with classmate Yun Won-gu, he pulled my ear and said, 'Defeat is certain, avoid it.'\\n\\nI immediately resolved with Lee Hyeok-gi from Gyeongseong Imperial University [who became commander of the leftist Korean Military Preparation Corps immediately after liberation] at the boarding house of a student from Yonhui Professional School to organize and strongly develop this student soldier refusal movement.\\n\\n▽Inchon Was Too Difficult Even for the Governor-General to Handle▽\\n\\nHowever, this secret leaked through a student Kim from Hyehwa Professional School and was reported to Governor-General Koiso through a pro-Japanese leader named Mun, who was Kim's relative. Perhaps sensing the seriousness of the matter, he immediately requested a meeting with our representatives through Mun.\\n\\nAfter heated discussion, we decided to attend the meeting, and the meeting with the Governor-General took place. We went with grave resolve, dividing up key questions.\\n\\nWe argued, 'Japan calls it a Holy War for Greater East Asia and recognizes independence for all other Southeast Asian countries, so why won't it grant independence to 20 million Koreans? Going to war without national independence is like dying a dog's death. Therefore, we will risk our lives to develop a student soldier refusal movement.'\\n\\nGovernor-General Koiso raised his voice, saying, 'Korea and Japan share the same ancestry and roots [dongjo-donggŭn]. Therefore Korea and Japan must become one [naeseon-ilche]. Your words have merit. That's why I called you. Resolving Korean dissatisfaction is precisely my duty.' Koiso looked at me intently and asked, 'Which school, who are you?'\\n\\nI answered loudly, 'I am Lee Cheol-seung from Bosung Professional.' He examined me once more from various angles and muttered as if to himself, 'Kim Seong-su is an impeccable person.'\\n\\nI instantly thought, 'Inchon is someone even the Governor-General finds difficult to handle.' I pressed him, asking, 'Will Bosung Professional also be closed in this professional college reorganization?' but could not get a clear answer. We told the Governor-General's persuasion, 'We don't understand. We're going back now,' speaking loudly and left the Governor-General's residence.\\n\\nAfterward, in 1944, the Government-General of Korea could not close Bosung Professional and changed Bosung Professional to Gyeongseong Colonial Economic Professional, Yonhui Professional to Gyeongseong Industrial Management Professional, and Ewha Women's Professional and Sookmyung Women's Professional to agricultural extension training centers. Gyeongseong Law Professional, Myeongryun Professional, and Hyehwa Professional were closed. In the end, Korea's professional colleges also underwent forced name changes.\\n\\n▽Justice Will Be Realized▽\\n\\nThe farewell ceremony held on December 5, 1944, was an event to send off us who were departing on a path to death. Mrs. Lee A-ju (Inchon's wife) and Mrs. Park Eun-hye (Jang Deok-su's wife) also attended this farewell ceremony. Inchon sat in the principal's office with a sullen expression until the ceremony began, then went up to the podium when it started and said in anguish, 'I was entrusted with your education, not your military service, yet we have gathered like this today.'\\n\\nStudent supervisor Jang Deok-su said, 'Your going to war is an unspeakable tragedy. But to put it differently, this is the first time our young people will hold guns and receive collective training and act together. So don't think only that you're going to die, but think that you're going to train your mind and body for our tomorrow.'\\n\\nThen Dr. Ahn Ho-sang said, 'There is the sun in the sky and the spirit of the nation on earth. And the conscience in people's hearts can never be broken by any guns or swords. If people act according to their conscience, the earth will be full of justice, and the sun in the sky will shine even brighter.' The hall became an ocean of tears.\\n\\nLibrarian Son Jin-tae said, 'I had a dream last night where you all lifted me up and cheered hurrah while tossing me in the air. I was also cheering hurrah when I woke up startled to find it was a dream.' This was 'words with substance,' hinting at our country's independence.\\n\\nAfter the farewell ceremony ended, we lit a bonfire with firewood in the playground in front of the main building and had our last drinks while eating 'curry rice' that Mrs. Lee A-ju had made by hand. We exploded our bitter resentment in a 'storm,' formed a scrum, and shouted the school cheer 'Sit Silent, Jaeho.' At that moment, someone shouted, 'Let's smash the Japanese police station.' We formed a protest group and left Anam-dong.\\n\\nWhen the situation became serious, Principal Kim Seong-su urgently called me. 'These people will cause trouble. If you get excited and cause trouble, the school will be closed and even the underclassmen will have nowhere to learn.' He said, 'As there is today, there is also tomorrow. Rising from sorrow and washing away worries is our Korean people! Don't try to cut with a single stroke, but take a long view of everything.' I broke out in a cold sweat trying to turn the excited protest group back to school and settle things down.\\n\\n▽The Student Soldier Encouragement Writing Was Not Directly Written by Inchon▽\\n\\nOn August 15, 1945, I heard Emperor Hirohito's unconditional surrender broadcast and came to Seoul on September 2 with my student soldier comrades to visit Inchon's home in Gye-dong [a neighborhood in Seoul]. The kind teacher was silent for a while, then sighed 'whew' and said as if to himself, 'Justice will prevail [sa-pil-gwi-jeong]' and warmly welcomed me, saying, 'Cheol-seung, you've returned alive.'\\n\\nInchon's Ulsan Kim clan and our Jeonui Lee clan had long social ties and in-law relationships [yeonsa]. My maternal grandmother was from the Ulsan Kim clan of Wolpyeong (Jangseong), Inchon's main family line.\\n\\nI frequented the living rooms of Inchon and Han Hak-su, Baek Gwan-su, and Hwang Tae-mun in Gye-dong. Particularly, I was the youngest regular guest among the visitors to this house's living room, so I didn't refuse even the errand of carrying meal trays, learning the wisdom and every move of patriotic senior leaders in the chaotic night before nation-building after liberation.\\n\\nAt that time, I played the role of security chief guarding the Korean Democratic Party headquarters with representative elders of the nationalist camp who would participate in the Korean Democratic Party, especially Kim Seong-su, Baek Gwan-su, Won Se-dong, and Seo Sang-il.\\n\\nWhen the school fell into the hands of the Korean People's Republic [Geongjun] and leftist vanguards, comrades like Yun Won-gu and Park Seok-gyu returned to school and earnestly urged my return. Particularly, Mrs. Lee A-ju, Inchon's wife, earnestly urged my return to school, so I returned to Bosung Professional's first professional department, political science third year in November 1945.\\n\\nNowadays, some call Inchon a pro-Japanese collaborator, but immediately after liberation, the Soviet military government and communists, to establish a red government, denounced Dr. Syngman Rhee as an American puppet and Inchon as a pro-Japanese collaborator. Even when I returned to my alma mater, leftist students following communist directives rejected Inchon as a pro-Japanese collaborator.\\n\\nIn 1988, some leftist elements from Korea University went down to Inchon's hometown of Gochang, North Jeolla Province, and painted the statue that provincial residents had erected to honor the teacher's noble national spirit, arousing the anger of North Jeolla residents.\\n\\nIn the same year, pro-North Juche ideology students [Korean student activists influenced by North Korean ideology] committed the unfilial act of binding with rope and trying to bury in a pit the statue built in Korea University's campus with donations from all alumni to honor the lofty intentions of founder Kim Seong-su.\\n\\nI persuaded the students: 'Have you ever met Inchon? Have you ever learned from him? Half a century has passed since liberation, yet with what intention and basis can you call the eternal teacher and leader of our nation and founder of Korea University a landlord pro-Japanese collaborator? Do you know that even during Japanese rule, your grandparents revered Inchon as a national leader? Be careful that behind such shameless acts lies complicity with Kim Il-sung's group's conspiracy to destroy the legitimacy of the Republic of Korea.'\\n\\nWhat leftists present as evidence for denouncing Inchon as a pro-Japanese collaborator is Inchon's student soldier encouragement writing published in Maeil Sinbo, the Government-General organ. Regarding this, Yu Jin-o clarifies in his book 'Yanghogi':\\n\\n<After the student soldier volunteering commotion settled down and most applicable students went out as student soldiers, this time orders came down from the Government-General for certain figures to write articles encouraging student soldiers in newspapers. The only newspaper published in Korean at that time was Maeil Sinbo, the Government-General organ.\\n\\nThe person who conveyed that order to me was Kim Byeong-gyu, a Maeil Sinbo reporter. According to Kim, the writer list was directly selected by the Security Bureau: Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-u, Yeo Un-hyeong, An Jae-hong, Lee Gwang-su, Jang Deok-su, myself, and one or two others. It was almost a comprehensive roster of figures who could be said to have influence in Korean society at that time.\\n\\nInchon, who doesn't write, was the problem. Kim had apparently already met Inchon and said he would ghostwrite Inchon's article, to which Inchon replied, 'If it absolutely must be written, ghostwrite it, but be sure to show me what's written before publishing it.' When I confirmed by phone, Inchon's answer was to be careful not to make it a 'shameful article.'\\n\\nEven saying the same thing, some people particularly like to use 'shameful' expressions. Since it was an article written reluctantly anyway, what difference would shameful or not shameful make, but still, while many people routinely showed excessive loyalty by saying 'Hakko Ichiu [all the world under one roof]' or 'Naisen Ittai [Japan and Korea as one],' Inchon, while unable to close the school doors against Japanese oppression, particularly disliked such 'shame.' It must have meant maintaining the national soul to the end even unto death.\\n\\nLooking at the 'article not by Inchon but under Inchon's name' that Kim had ghostwritten, being talented, it was a modest article with hardly any 'shameful' expressions as feared. I wrote an article with the theme 'Korean youth's military service is an increase in Korean strength' and handed it over to Kim along with the article under Inchon's name.\\n\\nI am now explaining the circumstances of how the student soldier encouragement articles came to be published, and particularly revealing even the real writer's name regarding the article under Inchon's name, because Inchon received severely unfair and unjust criticism from leftist forces after liberation due to those articles.>\\n\\n▽Inchon Extremely Restrained from Political Participation▽\\n\\nInchon did not want political participation throughout his life. Inchon lived supporting only schools (Korea University), media (Dong-A Ilbo), and industry (Gyeongbang, etc.). He had Goha Song Jin-u, with whom he had a close friendship, engage in politics, but when Goha was harmed by Han Hyeon-u and the Korean Democratic Party fell into chaos, he was pushed forward as a 'central' figure to unite various factions and regional figures from the nationalist camp and inevitably became Korean Democratic Party representative.\\n\\nWhen Vice President Lee Si-yeong resigned in protest of the Liberal Party regime's Geochang civilian massacre, National Defense Corps incident, and other human rights violations, incompetence, and corruption, Inchon was elected Vice President by the National Assembly. Then, seeing the political upheaval to scheme for the Liberal Party regime's long-term rule, he said, 'Even if the Vice President position is just holding a position without doing anything [si-wi-so-chan], the mere fact of having been Vice President under a dictatorial regime is shameful before the people,' and resigned from the Vice Presidency in 1952.\\n\\nInchon was sincere and calm, never engaging in political maneuvering and gestures like today. By showing the character of a pure grandfather and father at home, he made everyone, regardless of high or low status, feel close to him and treat him like a parent.\\n\\nIn 1947, when the Korea Track and Field Federation was asked to send athletes to the Boston International Marathon, they decided to send Seo Yun-bok from Geonkook Professional School, who held the best record at the time. I thought that if I could transfer Seo to Korea University and have him compete in the Boston Marathon, it could enhance Korea University's honor. Through earnest requests to Professor Kim Won-kwon in charge of physical education and senior Son Gi-jeong [1936 Olympic marathon gold medalist], I received approval for Seo's transfer to Korea University. I had Seo wear a Korea University uniform and run even before he became an official Korea University student. Seo Yun-bok won magnificently on April 19, 1947 (2 hours 25 minutes 39 seconds).\\n\\nNews of Seo Yun-bok's victory was featured prominently in American news agencies and newspapers, and Dr. Syngman Rhee even called Inchon to congratulate him.\\n\\nI belatedly reported the circumstances to President Hyeon Sang-yun and pleaded for Seo's transfer to Korea University. However, President Hyeon refused, saying, 'The school has clear regulations, and I cannot tolerate you acting on your own like that.' I even argued back, 'Has there ever been such worldwide promotion of Korea University since the school's founding?' I then immediately visited Inchon and appealed desperately.\\n\\nThe teacher scolded me, saying, 'While the motive came from patriotic and school-loving sincerity, and the result also raised the honor of the country and school, which is good, the point of breaking school rules is clear.' Eventually, with Inchon's help, Seo could apply an exceptional provision allowing retroactive admission and formally enter Korea University.\\n\\n▽Inchon Protected Bosung Professional with Great Righteousness▽\\n\\nThis also happened. The school authorities, having been upgraded to Korea University, made students from Bosung Professional's professional department take transfer exams. I demanded that the school give special consideration so that students who had contributed to protecting the campus by driving out the Communist Party that had caused campus disturbances including solidarity strikes would not fail the exams. I went to President Hyeon Sang-yun and Dean Yu Jin-o to appeal.\\n\\nHowever, when my wishes were not accepted, I instigated comrades to steal the application forms as an emergency measure and gather at Gaeun Temple. This incident was immediately reported to Inchon, who was presiding over a Korean Democratic Party executive meeting, and he immediately rushed over saying, 'Where is Cheol-seung? Find Cheol-seung. Who else but Cheol-seung would do such a thing?' looking for me.\\n\\nI was summoned before Inchon. He said, 'You helped overcome the school's crisis when you went as a student soldier in the past. I also know well that today's school reconstruction was due to your devoted contributions. Your contributions are admirable. But now are you planning to ruin the school?' speaking half pleadingly, half scolding.\\n\\nI played dumb, scratching my head and denying knowing anything about such facts. However, seeing the teacher's dismayed appearance for the first time, I was scared and thought 'this is not good.' After a while, I said, 'I'll go find out,' and immediately went to Gaeun Temple to have the bundle of application forms returned, allowing the exams to be taken safely.\\n\\nDue to this incident, our comrades who had worked hard for the Anti-Trusteeship Student League couldn't transfer to Korea University, like 'trying to remove a tumor but getting another one attached.' They almost all ended up joining the police. I also tried to quit school out of responsibility and loyalty to those comrades, but decided to continue staying at school, thinking of the overall position of student movements centered on the National Student Federation and the school as a whole.\\n\\nWhenever our nation and the Republic of Korea face difficulties, I recall these several incidents and remember the image of the immortal national leader Inchon, who left great traces of patriotism and love for the nation, always trying to be with the people while being virtuous and gentle yet sincere and calm, and on the other hand, valuing great righteousness.\\n\\nLee Cheol-seung, Representative Standing Chairman of the Liberal Democratic National Conference\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11901, "output_tokens": 5820, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

After liberation, they immediately split into leaders of left-wing and right-wing camps, playing leading roles in their respective factions. At that time, our Bosung College was like \\\"a hometown for young people where the fragrance of the nation wafted.\\\"\\n\\nThere is an anecdote to introduce here.

Don't try to cut with one stroke, but look at everything long-term.\\\" I broke into a cold sweat trying to turn the excited protesters back to school and calm the situation.\\n\\n▽The Student Soldier Recruitment Writing Was Not Written Directly by Inchon▽\\nI heard Emperor Hirohito's unconditional surrender broadcast on August 15, 1945, and returned to Seoul with my student soldier comrades on September 2, visiting Inchon's house in Gye-dong. The kind teacher was silent for a while, then sighed \\\"Whew\\\" and said to himself, \\\"Things will return to their proper course (sa-pil-gwi-jeong),\\\" then warmly welcomed me, saying, \\\"Cheol-seung, you've returned alive and well.\\\"\\n\\nInchon's Ulsan Kim clan and our Jeonji Lee clan had long-standing family connections and in-law relationships. My maternal grandmother was from the Ulsan Kim clan of Wolpyeong (Jangseong), which was Inchon's main family line.\\n\\nI frequented the sitting rooms of Inchon and Han Hak-su, Baek Gwan-su, and Hwang Tae-mun in Gye-dong. Particularly, as the youngest regular among the guests in this house's sitting room, I didn't refuse even the errand of carrying meal tables, learning the wisdom and every move of patriotic senior leaders during the chaos after liberation and the eve of nation-building.\\n\\nAt that time, I served as security captain, guarding the headquarters of the Korean Democratic Party and its representative elders of the nationalist camp who would participate in it, especially Kim Seong-su, Baek Gwan-su, Won Se-dong, and Seo Sang-il.\\n\\nWhen the school fell into the hands of the Korean Committee for the Preparation of Independence and left-wing advance guard, comrades like Yun Won-gu and Park Seok-gyu returned to school and earnestly recommended my return. Especially Lee A-ju, Inchon's wife, earnestly recommended my return to school, so I returned to Bosung College's first professional department, political science, third year in November 1945.\\n\\nNowadays, some people call Inchon pro-Japanese, but immediately after liberation, the Soviet military government and communists, in order to establish a red government, denounced Dr. Syngman Rhee as an American puppet and Inchon as pro-Japanese. Even when I returned to school, left-wing students following communist orders rejected Inchon as pro-Japanese.\\n\\nIn 1988, some left-wing elements from Korea University went down to Inchon's hometown of Gochang, Jeollabuk-do, and painted over a statue that local residents had erected to honor the teacher's noble national spirit, causing outrage among Jeollabuk-do residents.\\n\\nIn the same year, pro-North Korean Juchist students tied ropes around the statue that all alumni had built in Korea University's campus with donations to honor founder Kim Seong-su's noble intentions, dug a pit, and committed the unfilial act of trying to bury it.\\n\\nI persuaded the students: \\\"Have you ever met Inchon? Have you ever learned from him? Half a century has passed since liberation, so with what intention and basis can you call the eternal teacher and leader of our nation and founder of Korea University a landlord and pro-Japanese collaborator? Do you know that even during the Japanese colonial period, your grandparents revered Inchon as a national leader? Beware that behind such shameless acts, you are joining Kim Il-sung's conspiracy to destroy the legitimacy of the Republic of Korea.\\\"\\n\\nThe basis that leftists present for denouncing Inchon as pro-Japanese is the student soldier encouragement article by Inchon published in Maeil Sinbo, the Japanese Government-General's newspaper. Regarding this, Yu Jin-o revealed the following in his book \\\"Yangho-gi\\\" (Tale of Raising Tigers):\\n\\n<When the student soldier volunteer commotion was settled and most relevant students went as student soldiers, this time orders came down from the Government-General for certain prominent figures to write articles encouraging student soldiers in newspapers. The only newspaper published in Korean at that time was Maeil Sinbo, the Government-General's organ.\\n\\nThe one who delivered that order to me was Kim Byeong-gyu, a Maeil Sinbo reporter. According to Kim, the writer list was directly selected by the police bureau, including Kim Seong-su, Song Jin-u, Yeo Un-hyeong, An Jae-hong, Lee Gwang-su, Jang Deok-su, myself, and one or two others. It was almost a comprehensive roster of figures who could be said to have influence in Korean society at that time.\\n\\nThe problem was Inchon, who didn't write. Kim had apparently already met Inchon and said he would ghostwrite Inchon's article, to which Inchon replied, \\\"If it absolutely must be written, you may ghostwrite it, but be sure to show me what you've written before publishing it.\\\" When I confirmed by phone, Inchon's answer was to be careful not to write anything \\\"shameful.\\\"\\n\\nSome people like to use the expression \\\"shameful\\\" even for the same thing. Since it was an unwilling piece of writing anyway, what difference would shameful or not shameful make? But while many people routinely displayed excessive loyalty by spouting \\\"Hakko Ichiu\\\" (eight corners of the world under one roof) or \\\"Naisen Ittai\\\" (Japan and Korea as one body), Inchon, despite facing Japanese oppression and being unable to close the school, particularly hated such \\\"shame.\\\" It must have meant maintaining the national spirit until death.\\n\\nLooking at the \\\"article not by Inchon but under Inchon's name\\\" that Kim had ghostwritten, it was a modest piece with hardly any of the \\\"shameful\\\" expressions I had worried about, as befitting a talented writer. I wrote an article with the theme \\\"Korean youth's enlistment is an increase in Korean strength\\\" and gave it to Kim along with the article under Inchon's name.\\n\\nThe reason I now explain how the student soldier encouragement articles came to be published, and particularly reveal even the real writer's name regarding the article under Inchon's name, is because Inchon suffered severely unjust and unfair criticism from leftist forces after liberation due to that article.>\\n\\n▽Inchon Extremely Restrained from Political Participation▽\\nInchon did not want political participation throughout his life. Inchon lived supporting only schools (Korea University), media (Dong-A Ilbo), and industry (Kyeongbang, etc.). He had Goha Song Jin-u, who had a friendship like Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya with him, engage in politics, but when Goha was harmed by Han Hyeon-u and the Korean Democratic Party fell into chaos, he was elevated as the \\\"central\\\" figure uniting various factions of the nationalist camp and regional stakeholders and inevitably took on the role of Korean Democratic Party representative.\\n\\nWhen Vice President Lee Si-yeong resigned in protest against human rights violations, incompetence, and corruption such as the Liberal Party regime's Geochang civilian massacre incident and National Defense Corps incident, Inchon was elected vice president by the National Assembly. Then, seeing the political turmoil aimed at the Liberal Party regime's long-term rule, he said, \\\"Even if the vice presidency is just occupying a position without doing work (si-wi-so-chan), the mere fact of having been vice president under a dictatorial regime is shameful before the people,\\\" and resigned from the vice presidency in 1952.\\n\\nInchon was sincere and calm, not engaging in political maneuvering and gestures like today. By showing the pure grandfather and father's demeanor at home, he made everyone, regardless of high or low status, feel close to him and treat him like a parent.\\n\\nIn March 1947, when the Korea Track and Field Association was requested to send athletes to the Boston International Marathon, they decided to send Seo Yun-bok from Konkuk College, who held the best record at the time. I thought that if we transferred Seo to Korea University and had him compete in the Boston Marathon, it could enhance Korea University's honor. I earnestly requested Professor Kim Won-gwon, who was in charge of physical education, and senior Son Ki-jeong to approve Seo's transfer to Korea University. I had Seo wear a Korea University uniform and run even before he officially became a Korea University student. Seo Yun-bok won convincingly on April 19, 1947 (2 hours 25 minutes 39 seconds).\\n\\nNews of Seo Yun-bok's victory was prominently featured in American news agencies and newspapers, and Dr. Syngman Rhee even called Inchon with congratulations.\\n\\nI belatedly reported the circumstances to President Hyeon Sang-yun and pleaded for Seo's transfer to Korea University. However, President Hyeon refused, saying, \\\"The school has clear regulations, and I cannot tolerate you doing such things on your own.\\\" I rather retorted, \\\"Has there been such worldwide promotion of Korea University since the school's founding?\\\" I immediately went to see Inchon and pleaded desperately.\\n\\nThe teacher scolded me: \\\"Though the motive came from patriotic loyalty to country and school, and the result also raised the honor of the nation and school, you clearly violated school regulations.\\\" Eventually, with Inchon's help, Seo was able to officially enter Korea University by applying exceptional provisions allowing retroactive admission.\\n\\n▽Inchon Protected Bosung College with Great Righteousness▽\\nThere was also this incident. The school authorities, after upgrading to Korea University, required transfer examinations for students from Bosung College's professional department. I demanded that the school give special consideration so that students who had contributed to expelling the communists who had caused campus unrest through strikes and protecting the campus should not fail the examination. I went around appealing to President Hyeon Sang-yun and Dean Yu Jin-o.\\n\\nHowever, when my wishes were not accepted, I incited my comrades to steal the application forms as an emergency measure and gather at Gaeun Temple. This incident was immediately reported to Inchon, who was presiding over a Korean Democratic Party executive meeting, and he immediately rushed over, saying, \\\"Where did Cheol-seung go? Find Cheol-seung. If not Cheol-seung, who would have done such a thing?\\\" and looked for me.\\n\\nI was summoned before Inchon. Inchon said: \\\"You helped overcome the school's crisis when you went as student soldiers in the past. I also know well that today's school reconstruction was due to your devoted contributions. Your contributions are also commendable. But now are you planning to ruin the school?\\\" He spoke half pleading, half scolding.\\n\\nI played innocent, scratching my head and denying any knowledge of such facts. But seeing the teacher's distressed appearance for the first time, I felt scared and thought \\\"this won't do.\\\" After a while, I said, \\\"Let me go find out,\\\" and went directly to Gaeun Temple to have the bundle of applications returned so the examinations could be conducted safely.\\n\\nDue to this incident, like \\\"getting another lump while trying to remove one,\\\" our comrades who had worked hard for the Anti-Trusteeship Student League could not transfer to Korea University. Most of them ended up joining the police force. I also tried to quit school out of responsibility and loyalty to those comrades, but decided to remain in school, thinking about the student movement centered on the National Student Federation and the entire school's position.\\n\\nWhenever our nation and the Republic of Korea face difficulties, I recall these several incidents and remember the immortal national leader Inchon, who was virtuous and gentle yet sincere and calm, while also valuing great righteousness and always seeking to be with the nation, leaving behind the great traces of patriotism and love for the people.\\n\\nLee Cheol-seung, Representative Standing Chairman of the Liberal Democratic National Conference\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11538, "output_tokens": 5540, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

I drew thick black eyeliner around my eyes, almost excessively so, extending it long toward the outer corners. Cherry juice-colored tint made my lips look passionately red. The modest female college student with a backpack and books was nowhere to be found.\\n\\nOn the evening of August 27th at 7 PM, after finishing my preparations in the women's restroom on the second floor of the west building and leaving the building, a friend said, \\\"Hey, your makeup is way too heavy...\\\" She momentarily stopped and revealed a look of contemptuous curiosity that seemed to say \\\"What is this?\\\" I was satisfied with my provocative makeup and headed to work. I had changed myself in just two days.\\n\\n-From 'He asked. Why do you want to do this job?' on page 1 of the September 29th 'Korea University News'\\n\\nSeptember 29th, 8 PM. I was sitting on the bus home from work. It had been an unusually exhausting day. I leaned my head against the window and reflexively scrolled through my Facebook timeline with my thumb. Hundreds of 'Facebook friends' were each showing off their daily lives, ideals, and thoughts... Among them, one post caught my eye.\\n\\n200 comments, 10,000 views\\n\\nIt was 'Korea University News Female Reporter's Bartender Experience' posted on Korea University's student newspaper 'Korea University News' Facebook page. It was an article written by Korea University News reporter Yu Min-ji (21), who had experienced working as a bartender for a month at a talking bar in front of Korea University in Anam-dong, Seoul [a neighborhood where Korea University is located]. I quickly read through the article, which was about 5 pages of A4 paper. I immediately sent an email to Ms. Yu via mobile.\\n\\n\\\"The approach of setting up the special situation of a Korea University student bartender while touching on tuition and part-time job issues is quite provocative and refreshing.\\\"\\n\\nI met with Ms. Yu, who soon sent back a response of more than a span via KakaoTalk, twice on October 6th and 13th. We carefully discussed her month-long bartender experience, along with the reality of university media and current college student culture.\\n\\nMs. Yu's article became a huge topic on the internet. It was the first Korea University News article to surpass 10,000 internet views, and when this article was linked on an internet community called 'ㅍㅍㅅㅅ,' it received over 200 comments. The reactions coexisted between criticism and condemnation. There were many comments criticizing Ms. Yu and Korea University News, such as \\\"commodified sexuality\\\" and \\\"yellow journalism with sensational material.\\\"\\n\\nTo this, Ms. Yu said, \\\"Even the condemning comments felt welcome because I thought of them as interest.\\\" Professor Park Jae-young of the Department of Media Studies, who is the editor-in-chief of Korea University News, evaluated: \\\"Recently, the influence of university media has greatly diminished, making it difficult even to maintain continuity. It's unprecedented for an article published in a university newspaper to draw social attention like this. Moreover, this article is the first narrative piece written after a month-long experience by a university media reporter.\\\" Currently, Korea University News has 6 reporting journalists, which is one-third the level of 10 years ago. A Korea University News official conveyed the reality of university media: \\\"We constantly recruit trainee reporters, but more than half of those accepted don't last even a week.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Yu is a third-year student in the Department of Spanish Language and Literature at Korea University and has been active as a Korea University News reporter since early this year. Her long legs made her appear much taller than her actual height (168cm). The short skirt worn high at the waist further emphasized her tall stature. Her voluminous wavy hair, pointed red lips, and thick eyes without double eyelids made her look exactly like Hong Kong actress Shu Qi. She chattered cheerfully, saying \\\"I chose the Spanish department simply because I liked the passionate feeling, without knowing anything.\\\"\\n\\nWhen asked questions, she would chew over the question content in her mind for a while before answering briefly. She seemed slightly uncomfortable talking about herself. I imagined Ms. Yu standing under the dim lighting of a talking bar with heavy makeup on her youthful face. I had actually been to bars of similar types a few times following male colleagues. I had laughed and conversed a lot with the 'older sisters' there who were probably in their late twenties like me, but I realized I had never actually heard their own stories. I suddenly became curious about their stories.\\n\\n440 Hours of Bartender Part-time Pay\\n\\nA bartender's duties are to listen to customers, respond enthusiastically, and fill glasses to sell a lot of alcohol. In talking bars like this, conversation with customers is key. They also told me the prohibited actions. You cannot sit next to customers, nor should you allow customers to touch you. If customers force alcohol on bartenders, you must refuse. You cannot give your phone number to customers.\\n\\n▼ Why did you decide to write a bartender experience piece?\\n\\n\\\"Actually, it was a chance encounter. Last year, I saw a special feature article called 'Labor OTL' in a weekly magazine. It was an article written by reporters who directly worked for a month at places like potato soup restaurants and factories, experiencing the work, and it stayed with me more than any other labor-related article. Many of my friends do 'night part-time jobs' because of tuition fees. For one reason only: the hourly wage is good. I was curious about what it was really like, so I said I'd write an experience piece. After the month-long experience ended, I wrote the article.\\\"\\n\\n▼ What kind of place was the one where you had your experience?\\n\\n\\\"It's a 12-year-old bar in front of Korea University. It has about 15 standing seats and 7 four-person tables, selling whiskey, beer, and wine. Whiskey starts from 120,000 won [approximately $90 USD]... Many Korea University students, graduate students, professors, and Korea University graduates who work come there.\\\"\\n\\n▼ How was it when you first interviewed?\\n\\n\\\"I went after seeing a job posting on an internet part-time job site, but the owner didn't like it when I said I was a 'Korea University student.' He said Korea University students are unreliable and quit quickly... After pleading that 'I urgently need tuition money so I'll work hard,' I was able to work 4 times a week.\\\"\\n\\n▼ What's the hourly wage?\\n\\n\\\"The internet part-time job site posting said 12,000 won [approximately $9 USD] per hour, but they actually said 8,000 won [approximately $6 USD] for the first month. Now that I've worked over a month, it's 9,000 won [approximately $7 USD]. Working 4 times a week, 4-5 hours each time, my first month's salary was about 650,000 won [approximately $490 USD].\\\"\\n\\n▼ That's 3.9 million won [approximately $2,940 USD] if you work for six months. How much was this semester's tuition?\\n\\n\\\"3.5 million won [approximately $2,640 USD]. I thought about it too. I need to work 440 hours as a bartender without sleeping at night to save 3.5 million won. But living expenses cost a lot too, and you need to attend hagwons to build specs, and friends from the provinces have to pay monthly rent, so it's nowhere near enough.\\\"\\n\\nThis year's average private university tuition is 7.36 million won [approximately $5,550 USD] annually. Converted to one semester, that's 3.68 million won [approximately $2,780 USD].\\n\\n▼ Just doing bartender part-time work while attending school is hard enough, but to cover tuition and living expenses, you'd need to do additional part-time work or receive scholarships.\\n\\n\\\"That's right. Going to work at 9 PM, working until 2 AM, then going to 9 AM class the next day was really too hard. I resented it enough to think 'Why does the sun rise so fast?'\\\"\\n\\n▼ Being a bartender seems like just running errands at a bar, pouring drinks, and talking... It doesn't seem that hard.\\n\\n\\\"Oh no, it's not. It's a job that combines service work and manual labor. When there are customers, you talk, but when there aren't customers, you do other work. Just wiping the bottles in the display case is a big job - wiping 50 bottles one by one. From lifting heavy bottles up and down so much, my arms were trembling. On days when closing is late, we'd finish at 5 AM. If I had to go to class, I could only sleep for two and a half hours.\\\"\\n\\n▼ Actually, I wonder how much you really felt the hardships of bartenders through just one month of experience.\\n\\n\\\"What made me feel like I was 'really' doing this job was when I'd get calls saying I didn't need to come in on days when there was no work, and then I'd feel deflated. The daily wage I couldn't earn that day would pop into my head... Once I got scolded by the boss over a calculation error and tears welled up in my eyes. Then a customer called me saying 'Please give me some ice,' and without realizing it, I put a smile on my face and answered 'Yes~.' Before I knew it, working while hiding my emotions had become ingrained in my body.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to sleep with you\\\"\\n\\nOne customer who said he was a Korea University graduate kept hitting on me, saying I was pretty, and when he got drunk, he said to me, \\\"I want to sleep with you.\\\" He said he would help me do what I wanted to do and raise me up. But when he found out I attended Korea University, he suddenly opened his eyes wide and shook his head, muttering \\\"Oh, that won't do...\\\" Do men see women who do this kind of work as that easy? That day I came home and buried my face in my bed and cried for a long time.\\n\\n▼ You must have had many unpleasant experiences.\\n\\n\\\"As I wrote in the article, there were people who grabbed my wrist while drunk and threw tantrums saying 'I'm not a strange person' and 'please listen to my story,' someone who tried to kiss the back of my hand while drunk, people asking me on dates, and among students, someone who said 'if we meet at school, I'll buy you drinks as a senior, not as a customer.'\\\"\\n\\n▼ Do 'problem customers' mostly come alone?\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't matter who they're with. There were even people who came in groups and filmed one of them hitting on me with their phones. They were mainly married men. You especially have to be careful of people who come drunk after 2 AM.\\\"\\n\\n▼ You must have been very upset.\\n\\n\\\"I'd think 'that's just how it is' but then tears would well up... It was also ridiculous to see people's attitudes change when I casually confessed that I was a Korea University student.\\\"\\n\\n▼ Why do you think they suddenly acted refined when you said you were a Korea University student?\\n\\n\\\"Well... I feel uncomfortable answering because it might emphasize sexual aspects too much. There could be various reasons to guess.\\\"\\n\\n▼ Did you become personally close with any customers?\\n\\n\\\"Yes, an English Literature senior who's a regular customer. He even knows my name.\\\"\\n\\n▼ Female bartenders might be seen as a profession that commodifies sexuality for profit, so isn't male customers' harassment naturally expected?\\n\\n\\\"I don't think what I experienced was a special situation. Having unpleasant sexual experiences because you're a woman - that's something most people generally experience, right? The older sister who works as a bartender with me said sexual harassment from male coworkers was worse when she worked at a mobile phone sales store than now. There aren't many women there. I wanted to capture in (the article) the common unpleasant feelings that female college students doing night part-time work might experience, not the special nature of being a bartender.\\\"\\n\\n▼ Right. Actually, women are always exposed to sexual harassment or discrimination. On the other hand, don't women sometimes use their sexuality at work? Actively utilizing things like charm, affectionate personality, and beauty rather than ability... Actually, being a bartender is a part-time job only pretty women can do.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I suppose that could be the case.\\\"\\n\\n'Tutoring Jobs' Are a Thing of the Past\\n\\nDark circles under my eyes were unsightly thick, and I kept yawning. Even after washing with soap multiple times, my whole body smelled of cigarettes. I needed coffee to avoid dozing off in class. I bought the cheapest 1,700 won [approximately $1.30 USD] Americano near school. Working this job, I developed a habit of converting everything into part-time work hours and income. On a day I skipped a 3-hour class because I overslept, I calculated how much tuition that represented. It was equivalent to 4-5 hours of bartender work.\\n\\n▼ Are there other college students among the bartenders you work with?\\n\\n\\\"Out of 5 total, 2 including me are Korea University students. There are 11 talk bars in front of Korea University, so there are probably many Korea University students working there.\\\"\\n\\nTuition soars but demand for tutoring part-time jobs decreases, so college students prefer 'night part-time jobs' that at least have high hourly wages. A part-time job recruitment bulletin board installed at a private university.\\n\\n▼ Do you have many friends doing night part-time work?\\n\\n\\\"Yes. One older sister from the class of 2007 has been working as a bartender for several years. She said most of her friends have graduated. Besides bars, night part-time work is very popular.\\\"\\n\\n▼ It's because you only have time at night due to school classes.\\n\\n\\\"Right. And night part-time jobs have higher hourly wages.\\\"\\n\\n▼ What are the usual hourly wages for part-time work?\\n\\n\\\"I worked part-time at a coffee shop in Jongno, Seoul [a central district in Seoul], and it was about 6,000 won [approximately $4.50 USD] per hour.\\\"\\n\\nThe 2014 minimum wage is 5,510 won [approximately $4.15 USD].\\n\\n▼ Don't your friends do much tutoring?\\n\\n\\\"It's decreased a lot. When posts saying 'tutoring job available' go up on school community boards, the view count explodes and they're filled within an hour. There are many professional teachers who do tutoring as a career, and large hagwons and internet lectures are popular, so there's an atmosphere of not readily entrusting tutoring to inexperienced college students. These days, taking advantage of the difficulty in finding tutoring work, there are many 'tutoring intermediary companies' that connect tutors with students, but they take enormous commissions. They take almost the entire first month's tutoring fee.\\\"\\n\\n▼ So even SKY (Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University) students can't easily find tutoring work... What are the current tutoring rates?\\n\\n\\\"For areas other than Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] in Seoul, it's 350,000-400,000 won [approximately $265-300 USD] per month for high school students twice a week? Middle school students pay less. People often say 'prices are skyrocketing but tutoring fees stay the same.' But even this is really hard to find.\\\"\\n\\nThe Other Side of the Spec Craze\\n\\n▼ Even students from the 1980s say \\\"I covered all tuition and living expenses with tutoring fees,\\\" which really shows they don't know reality. Actually, as a 2005 student, I felt a kind of 'relative deprivation' when I was in college. If I divide my classmates (Korea University Korean Language and Literature) into three groups, there were those from Seoul's Gangnam District 8 [an elite school district], special purpose high school graduates, and friends like me from Seoul outskirt regular high schools or from the provinces. The school life was different between friends who received all their spending money and tuition from their parents versus kids like me who ran around the whole neighborhood tutoring to earn spending money, and consequently employment results differed too. If the first two groups mostly passed civil service exams, went to law school, or entered public enterprises and large corporations with solid specs, the latter went to somewhat 'inferior' workplaces.\\n\\n\\\"But back then you at least had a lot of tutoring work, but now even that is difficult. These days there are so many specs required that just keeping up with those is overwhelming.\\\"\\n\\n▼ What kinds of things are there?\\n\\n\\\"TOEIC [Test of English for International Communication, a standardized English proficiency test] 900 points is basic, plus Chinese and Korean language certificates and second foreign language certificates - that's four just for languages - plus computer certificates, overseas experience, and GPA. I'm so busy building 'basic specs' that I don't even have time to ask myself what I really want to do.\\\"\\n\\n▼ I think college students cling to specs because they want to live earnestly but don't know how. They're only used to producing visible results and getting praised by parents.\\n\\n\\\"That could be it.\\\"\\n\\nAs I finished the interview, I asked \\\"What do you really want to do?\\\" She had been giving confident answers throughout, but struggled to find an answer to this question, thinking for a long time. Watching her lost in deep thought, I thought that rather than pressuring her to answer quickly, helping her think sufficiently might be the role of the older generation.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9094, "output_tokens": 4420, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Lee Seung-bae, husband of Sim Sang-jung, the sole female candidate among the major presidential contenders and Justice Party leader. Lee, a Seoul National University alumnus and former labor activist like Representative Sim, voluntarily became a househusband after Sim entered the National Assembly in 2004. On February 14, Lee, who had been reluctant to appear publicly despite many people's curiosity, met exclusively with Women's DongA magazine. This is Lee's first interview with any media outlet.\\n\\nOn February 16, Sim Sang-jung (58), the Justice Party leader, was selected as the party's 19th presidential candidate. Her campaign announcement was made earlier on January 19. While she withdrew from the previous presidential race after declaring support for Democratic Party candidate Moon Jae-in, this time she is determined to see it through to the end. With her strong personality that doesn't back down even to loud male lawmakers, she is known in political circles as a 'strong woman.' The name of her fan club, established last July, is 'Sim Crush,' combining Sim Sang-jung with 'girl crush' (when women admire or look up to other women).\\n\\nRepresentative Sim, who entered Seoul National University's history education department in 1978, first established the university's general women's student association in 1980 and led the Guro Alliance Strike in 1985. She worked as a labor activist with organizations like the National Council of Trade Unions (predecessor to the current Korean Confederation of Trade Unions), and entered the National Assembly in 2004 as a first-term lawmaker for the Democratic Labor Party, becoming one of the opposition's top stars. As a working mother married for 26 years with a college-age son, she has been able to dedicate herself to politics for the past 13 years thanks to the solid support of her husband Lee Seung-bae (61). After Representative Sim received her parliamentary badge, Lee voluntarily took charge of household affairs and has been living as a househusband.\\n\\nLee was born in 1956 in Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, and followed the elite KS track (Kyunggi High School-Seoul National University) during the era of non-standardized high schools. Though he entered Seoul National University's Oriental History Department in 1975, he graduated in 1983 after receiving indefinite suspension for participating in protests. After pursuing the path of labor activism, he married in 1992 and had his son Woo-gyun (24) in 1993. We met this tall, kind-smiling man on the afternoon of February 14 at Representative Sim's district office in Deokyang-gu, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province. He attends candlelight vigils every Saturday.\\n\\n▼ Is there a reason you attend rallies every week?\\nI started going out of curiosity about what ordinary citizens were thinking, and when I see people who attend candlelight vigils, I feel a clear and bright energy from them. They earnestly wish for even a slightly better society. Creating such a space for empathy has turned it into a political, social, and cultural festival. Although the number of participants has decreased as the weather got colder, those who still come out are really spirited. I like the consensus they're building.\\n\\n▼ What thoughts do you have when you see the current president?\\nIt seems like someone who lies and deviates from common sense, someone who doesn't understand the people's hearts, is being too stubborn. Even elementary school students would shake their heads in disbelief.\\n\\n▼ Representative Sim Sang-jung was the first among opposition leaders to call for impeachment and received public support for it. Are spouses of one mind?\\nWhen she boldly called for impeachment that the people wanted, I thought it was a desirable attitude as a politician. Reading public sentiment correctly and following that will is the duty of a National Assembly member. I also agreed when Representative Sim called for the president's resignation early in the candlelight rallies.\\n\\n▼ There are criticisms that the Justice Party failed to demonstrate its presence during the impeachment crisis.\\nThe Justice Party played a very important role until the impeachment motion passed in the National Assembly. But after it passed with an overwhelming 234 votes, interest in presidential candidates heated up, and as the Saenuri Party [predecessor to the People Power Party] split, the Justice Party was pushed back to fifth place, weakening its presence. However, the Justice Party believes we shouldn't be complacent until impeachment actually happens. The reason the Justice Party held primaries earlier than other parties was to confirm our candidate early and actively respond to the political schedule ahead.\\n\\n▼ Quite a few people think Representative Sim and Justice Party floor leader Roh Hoe-chan are a married couple (laughs).\\nIf being perceived that way has a positive influence, that's fine. It doesn't mean our marriage will break up. I think it's proof that both of them are doing well. Representative Roh is an excellent political leader produced by Korea's progressive politics. I hope he does even better. Representative Roh is a year junior to me at Kyunggi High School, so we know each other well personally. We got to know each other through connections when I was active in labor movements.\\n\\n▼ We're curious about both your thoughts on misogyny and misandry, which have emerged as social problems.\\nWomen and men should respect and understand each other's differences, but I think there's a lot of confusion with discrimination. Discrimination should be eliminated. I believe discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or ideology should never be tolerated. Because people don't have awareness of such differences and regard their own values as absolute standards, it manifests as extreme hostility toward men or extreme hostility toward women. However, I don't think freedom of expression is infinitely open, as it can be distorted against one's intentions.\\n\\n▼ Netizens called Representative Sim 'progressive Su-ae' after seeing photos from her Seoul National University days. Do you have any pet name you'd like to give Representative Sim personally?\\nPeople say my wife had a Su-ae-like feeling when she was young. Not so much these days though (laughs). I can't really think of a pet name I'd like to give her, but when I look at my wife, she's like a snow flower blooming in the midst of hardship.\\n\\n▼ We heard you first met through an introduction by Kim Moon-soo, former Gyeonggi governor, who was your senior in Seoul National University's activist circles.\\nSenior Kim Moon-soo didn't arrange a meeting to set us up. In 1985, when I was driving freight trucks to experience the labor field, I often met with poet Park No-hae, who was working as a bus driver for the same reason. When the Guro Alliance Strike occurred that year, poet Park No-hae told me that the person who led that strike was Sim Sang-jung. That was the first time I heard my wife's name and learned what an amazing person she was. Then that winter, senior Kim Moon-soo said to me, 'It would be good if you and Sim Sang-jung met.' That senior didn't set us up, but hearing those words did make me more interested in my wife. Then in fall 1986, I first met my wife at a gathering of labor activists. At that time, my wife was a high-priority fugitive. The police had placed a bounty of 5 million won [approximately $12,500 USD at 1986 exchange rates] on her, with several ranks of promotion promised, viewing her as the mastermind behind the Guro Alliance Strike. Senior Kim Moon-soo had been taken to the Namyeong-dong [infamous interrogation center] by the security command due to the May 3 Incheon Uprising and wasn't at that gathering. When they tortured that senior, they apparently demanded 'Where is Sim Sang-jung?' Of course, since he didn't open his mouth, my wife wasn't captured.\\n\\n▼ Former Governor Kim's recent actions are quite unexpected.\\nI think he's gone down a path that's too far astray. Looking at that senior brings up many different thoughts. In the past, he was a very authoritative and respected senior, a tremendous person, but seeing him today, it's regrettable that he seems to have become rather unsightly.\\n\\n▼ What was your first impression of Representative Sim?\\nI had various fantasies about her because she was a fugitive and I had heard about her activities, but she had a neat appearance, neither big nor small. But watching her logically present her thoughts, I thought she was exactly as I had imagined.\\n\\n▼ Did you feel attracted to her as the opposite sex?\\nI wasn't immediately smitten, but the following year in 1987, when the June Democratic Uprising occurred, I happened to meet her again briefly at a crosswalk in front of Seoul National University's medical school in Hyehwa-dong, Seoul. We both had appointments then, so we greeted lightly and parted, but since unions were being formed nationwide at that time, we met frequently at joint rallies and meetings from 1988 onward and began dating. Both Representative Sim and I later worked for organizations that supported labor unions. Representative Sim worked for the National Council of Trade Unions, which was formed in 1990, and I worked for the National Council of Labor Movement Organizations, which was established in 1988.\\n\\n▼ So love blossomed while doing labor activism.\\nI asked her to date around 1989. In 1990, I was detained at the Namsan [location of former] KCIA as a member of the National Council of Labor Movement Organizations, and the interrogator asked me, 'Is Sim Sang-jung your girlfriend?' I played dumb and said I didn't know. Then he said, 'Do you know where you are to be lying like this? We've seen you two together.' They had conducted civilian surveillance. They had even taken photos, so I couldn't deny it. In the end, we became a couple recognized by the KCIA (laughs).\\n\\n▼ What aspects of Representative Sim attracted you?\\nI felt that her convictions aligned well with my worldview and beliefs. What I particularly learned from Representative Sim was awareness of gender equality. The older seniors in the labor movement had patriarchal thoughts, viewing women merely as supporters who would take care of them, but meeting my wife changed my shallow gender consciousness significantly.\\n\\n▼ How did you date?\\nSince we were poor lovers, when we occasionally met, our dates consisted of having tea and walking together. I remember Representative Sim found walking quite tiring.\\n\\n▼ What did you call each other?\\nI called her 'Sang-jung-ssi,' and my wife called me 'senior.'\\n\\n▼ Did you propose first too?\\nYes. I proposed around 1991, but she didn't answer. We met at a coffee shop and I confessed with what I thought were nice words: 'Let's go together as lifelong companions. I want us to look ahead and walk together.' But my wife didn't answer, so our meetings became distant for quite some time. I thought, 'What's this? Doesn't she like me?' But it wasn't in my nature to approach aggressively either. As the waiting period got longer, I wondered if I should forget her, but then we confirmed each other's feelings. My wife also made up her mind and thought and planned a lot about the life we'd share together. She was in a hurry too. Hahaha.\\n\\n▼ Did both families welcome your marriage?\\nAt the time of marriage, I was 37 years old by Korean age, and my wife was 34. We were still bachelors and spinsters by those days' standards, so both families were thrilled. My father-in-law and mother-in-law were extremely happy. They seemed to have been very worried that my wife wasn't getting married.\\n\\n▼ What kind of work did your parents do?\\nMy father-in-law was an elementary school teacher, and my father was a small business owner. Both mothers were housewives. My wife's family had a relatively more liberal atmosphere than ours. Our family was economically poorer.\\n\\n▼ There must have been interesting episodes from the wedding and honeymoon.\\nWe held our wedding in fall 1992 at Suwoon Hall behind Hollywood Theater in Nakwon-dong, Seoul, and many guests came, perhaps because we married late. Then we went to Jeju Island for our honeymoon with a junior couple. A college junior who was a year below me had married and even had a child but couldn't have a wedding ceremony, which seemed to become a source of regret. Taking advantage of our wedding, that junior also got to have a honeymoon that wasn't quite a honeymoon. Back then, unlike now when there are many travel packages, that junior knew someone in Jeju Island who helped us a lot. Best of all, we could see unique places that only Jeju natives knew about (laughs).\\n\\n▼ You worked in publishing and planning after marriage.\\nAround the time I got married, world history was undergoing dramatic changes. People who had been involved in the National Council of Labor Movement Organizations either sought different paths or looked for new directions suitable for the changes. While the National Council of Trade Unions that Representative Sim belonged to continued to thrive, our organization split and I had nothing to do. At that time, I took over the operation of a small, ownerless publishing company related to Representative Sim. I thought of it as an extension of my previous work. I had gotten married and needed to make a living somehow. I thought I would return to labor activism someday, but things didn't work out as planned. Even giving my all, success was uncertain, and since I hadn't started with firm resolve, I couldn't concentrate well on publishing work. Still, I did publishing and planning work for about 10 years, until the early 2000s.\\n\\n▼ We heard that after Representative Sim became a Democratic Labor Party lawmaker in 2004, you took charge of all household affairs.\\nAt that time, the Democratic Labor Party had just entered the parliament for the first time, so it wasn't well-organized, and since there were only first-term lawmakers in the party, there were no seniors to share know-how. Representative Sim had to create everything anew, so there was really a lot to do. So I handled everything from household affairs to sometimes acting as secretary and aide. I considered that my given role. Since I hadn't stepped forward with clear intentions to do politics myself, I became a househusband to firmly establish at least one person. I judged that helping Representative Sim work well was most important. Looking at things now, there are really many people who want to realize their demands or aspirations through Sim Sang-jung. They're supporters who empathize with and support Representative Sim's intentions. Since she has supporters, Representative Sim isn't just an individual. My job is to find and do things that can help such a Representative Sim.\\n\\n▼ Haven't you only done housework since becoming a househusband?\\nWhile I do housework, I don't devote myself entirely to domestic affairs. I work or have side jobs, sometimes we're dual-income. Before my wife entered the National Assembly, I did laundry and dishes while my wife did cooking and meal preparation, but after my wife started legislative activities, I took over all those tasks.\\n\\n▼ What are the hardships of being a househusband?\\nThere are many people who are really good at housekeeping, so I wonder if I dare use the term 'househusband.' I'm unqualified. I mostly just take care of my own meals at home. However, during periods of dual income, we had many difficulties with childcare. Even when we left our child at daycare, it was impossible to match the closing time. It was exhausting for both of us. I thought our child would be very stressed, so later we left the child with my wife's family and visited on weekends. When our child was in elementary school, we had him stay at a junior colleague's house nearby after school. I felt sorry for our child, but we both had to work then, so there was no choice.\\n\\n▼ Who manages household expenses?\\nI do. When Representative Sim brings home her parliamentary salary, I use it for household management and raising our child, and I cover shortfalls by working side jobs.\\n\\n▼ What takes up the largest portion of living expenses?\\nProbably our child's education costs. He hasn't finished his studies yet. Our son graduated from Ewoo School (an alternative school), spent a year as a repeat test-taker [a student retaking CSAT after high school graduation], and entered Kyung Hee University's philosophy department. He's now a senior. He'll probably go to the military after graduation.\\n\\n▼ Was there a special reason for sending your son to an alternative school?\\nPerhaps because our child didn't receive much parental care from a young age, he wasn't very bright when he entered the upper grades of elementary school during adolescence. So we sent him to an alternative school instead of a regular middle school. While academic competitiveness might be lower since they don't focus on entrance exams, the atmosphere is free and allows diverse experiences, which seemed like a good fit for our child. When we sent our child to that school, we also moved to Suji, Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, near the school. He also completed high school at Ewoo School, and he became much brighter while attending that school. His interest in humanities grew there, which led him to choose philosophy for university, and now he shows deep interest in social issues.\\n\\n▼ Do you and Representative Sim often discuss social issues or political matters at home?\\nRepresentative Sim usually wakes up at 5:30 AM and leaves the house before 6 AM. She mostly comes home after 10 PM. So I don't talk to her much at home. She talks with many people outside, and when she comes home exhausted, I shouldn't tire her out further. She needs to recharge to go out and be active the next day, so aside from absolutely necessary conversations, we don't talk much.\\n\\n▼ How many points would you give Representative Sim as a wife and mother?\\nSince I handle our household affairs, judging by her work outside the home, I'd give her about 95 points. Our son also considers his mother a role model. She tries to do her job uprightly and sincerely. Even though she doesn't have much time with family, when she's home, she tries to make one more stew for the two men in the house.\\n\\n▼ What dish does Representative Sim cook well?\\nShe makes seasoned crab well and is confident about it. She makes it well by kneading it with her hands.\\n\\n▼ You must be a popular 'yoseknam' (man who cooks well) these days.\\nWhen I'm with my son, I make kimchi stew or army stew quite well, but my skills aren't extraordinary. If I had someone to eat my homemade meals three times a day, I think I'd enjoy cooking and want to learn properly, but both my wife and son leave early in the morning and mostly solve meals by eating out. I often eat alone, so I just eat with rice, kimchi, and seaweed, or grill some fish and make do.\\n\\n▼ Listening to your story, it seems you and your wife rarely fight.\\nCan married couples have no disagreements at all? Living together, we know what irritates each other, so we avoid those things. No couple is 100% satisfied with each other. Living together, you're bound to see shortcomings. For example, my inability to clean thoroughly might seem inadequate to Representative Sim, and I might have various feelings about Representative Sim too, but thinking rationally, since it's not problematic enough, I don't bother mentioning it. For instance, there are cases where my wife's and my perspectives differ and our views clash, and it's due to remaining male-centered thinking.\\n\\n▼ What if your roles were reversed?\\nIf my wife became the husband, she probably wouldn't be patriarchal. I don't think she'd have excessive expectations of her spouse either (laughs).\\n\\n▼ How do your parents view their son living as a househusband?\\nNaturally, they had expectations for me, so they could say, 'You could do politics too, why don't you?' These days, some residents in the district (Ilsan Deokyang-gu) say the same thing, but if I hadn't married at all, it would be different, but since someone needs to be the foundation for another person to stand, my parents understand. Now my mother thinks very proudly of my wife as a daughter-in-law. My late father felt the same way.\\n\\n▼ What kind of external support do you provide outside the home?\\nI do civic activities for district residents and other civic movements related to the Justice Party. I also think that's important external support I should provide.\\n\\n▼ When was the most difficult time in your married life?\\nI started publishing business around the time we married in 1992 and did it for about 10 years, but when the 1997 foreign exchange crisis hit, we faced difficulties. The business didn't completely collapse, but sales dropped and debt accumulated, making recovery difficult. At that time, Representative Sim continued union work, but such problems put pressure on our lives, making things very tough.\\n\\n▼ How did you overcome that crisis?\\nThanks to help from people around us and cooperation, the problem was resolved around 2003, just before Representative Sim entered the National Assembly. After that, while exploring other career paths, I once thought about becoming a traditional Korean medicine doctor, but I gave up after my wife entered politics. I judged it wasn't time to start new ventures. I still think my choice then wasn't bad.\\n\\n▼ When she failed to be reelected in 2008, what comfort did you give Representative Sim?\\nIn a country with representative democracy, being outside the National Assembly reduces a politician's sphere of activity, so I said, 'Let's work in the district for four years and start again. There's so much work for us to do in this world.' Afterward, Representative Sim worked with local residents to create a village school, giving lectures, planning, and carrying out activities needed in the community.\\n\\n▼ How did you feel when Representative Sim, who re-entered the National Assembly in 2012, resigned from her co-representative position taking responsibility for the Unified Progressive Party's proportional representation primary fraud scandal?\\nAt that time, the biggest faction within the Unified Progressive Party was the old Democratic Labor Party faction represented by Lee Jung-hee. The next biggest faction was the People's Participation Party faction represented by Yoo Si-min, and the Sim Sang-jung-Roh Hoe-chan faction was the smallest. The three factions united in a co-representative system to consolidate power, but chemical homogenization between the two large factions was difficult. That problem manifested in the proportional representation primary fraud. Since Representative Sim had no way to resolve that problem, she resigned from the co-representative position. Thanks to that, I think the newly created Justice Party could establish in voters' minds the perception that it's constitutionally different from the Unified Progressive Party, which was dissolved in 2014.\\n\\n▼ Recently, presidential candidates compared their images to food, which became a topic. What food could Representative Sim Sang-jung be compared to?\\nSim Sang-jung is salt. She has consistently worked with conviction to prevent this society from rotting, and she plays the role of seasoning to meet the times by presenting policies our society needs at each moment, so I think she resembles salt.\\n\\n▼ What do you think Representative Sim did best as a politician?\\nRaising issues about chaebol [large conglomerate] problems, industrial accidents involving female Samsung Electronics workers with leukemia, and humidifier disinfectant damage—bringing attention to people's suffering in daily life—these were all good works. But above all, I want to emphasize her consistent pursuit of the importance of modern democratic parties. It's really problematic when parties, which are the subjects of representative democracy, don't accurately read the will of the sovereign people and use top-down nomination processes. Representative Sim wants to create proper parties and do politics that well serves public opinion.\\n\\n▼ What kind of country does Representative Sim dream of for Korea?\\nShe wants to create a country where anyone who works hard is rewarded, a country where such people are happy. That's why she compressed this presidential election's slogan into 'Democracy with Labor.' She also dreams of a Korea where peace is established on the Korean Peninsula without the danger of war and exists within mutually beneficial international relations.\\n\\n▼ If Representative Sim is elected president, what would you like to do as 'First Gentleman'?\\nIf that happens, I think that would be the day our country becomes a 'advanced welfare state.' It would be a time when we wouldn't need to envy other countries. When that time comes, capable talents will fulfill their roles in appropriate positions, so would someone like me really be necessary? If there's any errand work to do, maybe I could do that. If such a day really comes, I'd like to work on environmental issues for the future of humanity.\\n\\n▼ Do you have a life motto that serves as your compass?\\n(Pointing to calligraphy reading 'Like the First Time' hanging on the office wall) This is calligraphy by teacher Shin Yeong-bok [prominent Korean intellectual and calligrapher] meaning not to lose one's initial intentions. Looking at his calligraphy and contemplating its meaning puts my mind at ease. I also like the saying 'Yugong Yisan' [The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains]. It means you can achieve anything if you work steadily and diligently. I also took to heart words spoken by a history teacher while teaching Chinese history. It's from a writing by Fan Zhongyan [Chinese scholar-official], a military strategist and prime minister during the Song Dynasty, which can be expressed in four Chinese characters as 'Seonwoo Huwak' [Worry First, Enjoy Later]. It means 'A scholar should worry about the world's concerns before others and enjoy the world's pleasures after others.' I think it's something public officials must engrave in their hearts (laughs).\\n\\nAs we concluded the interview, we asked about his wishes for this year. He answered without hesitation: 'For the wishes of the candlelight public sentiment to be fulfilled.'\\n\\n'Current domestic and international situations are bad, and people's lives are tough. Until the Constitutional Court's impeachment ruling comes out, I earnestly hope that the good public sentiment waiting patiently, though frustrated, won't be betrayed. I hope this situation is resolved quickly as the candlelight public sentiment wishes, and national affairs become stable.'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 13600, "output_tokens": 6283, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The faces of Park Chan-ik (front row, left) and Jo So-ang (back row, second from left), who organized the Korean Independence Army in Manchuria in 1919, are visible. Dong-A Ilbo DB\\n\\n《While the February 8 Independence Declaration conspiracy was in full swing in Tokyo, Japan, secret orders from the Dongje Society were also delivered to Manchuria, China. Jo So-ang, who had been in despair over the divisions among Manchurian independence movement groups that each acted as separate heroes, was hiding in seclusion in Jilin...》\\n\\nOn January 24, 1919 (December 23, 1918 by the lunar calendar), agent Jeong Won-taek (1890-1971), who had received secret orders from Shin Gyu-sik, leader of Shanghai's secret organization Dongje Society [Tongji Society], left Fengtian and infiltrated Jilin. This was when Dongje Society agents in charge of Japan were busy conspiring with Korean students in Tokyo for the February 8 Independence Declaration. Jeong Won-taek also had to succeed in organized independence activities centered in the Jilin region of Manchuria. Only then could they provide strength to Korean representatives like Kim Gyu-sik who had been dispatched to the Paris Peace Conference.\\n\\nJeong Won-taek, a graduate of the Dongje Society's educational institution Pakdal Academy, met senior comrade Park Chan-ik (1884-1949) at a Chinese inn (客棧, Chinese lodging facility) in Jilin Province. Jeong Won-taek showed Park Chan-ik Shin Gyu-sik's secret message and mentioned confidential independence declaration activities in various regions including America, Shanghai, Japan, and Korea.\\n\\nSeeing Shin Gyu-sik's secret message, Park Chan-ik missed the 'stylish elder brother' Shin Gyu-sik from Shanghai with his black sunglasses and Kaiser mustache. Park Chan-ik had met Shin Gyu-sik and sworn brotherhood when he attended the government industrial training school in Korea. In 1909, Shin Gyu-sik was the president and editor of the magazine 'Industrial World,' launched to promote industrial development in the Korean Empire, while Park Chan-ik was the publisher.\\n\\nPark Chan-ik and Jeong Won-taek decided to rally independence activists from West and North Jiandao according to Shin Gyu-sik's secret orders and carry out independence activities.\\n\\nFirst, Jeong Won-taek contacted Jo So-ang (Jo Yong-eun, 1887-1958) through coded messages using postal boxes at post offices. This was a method of writing codes that only Dongje Society agents could understand on postcards and sending them to communication addresses. (From Jeong Won-taek's diary 'Jisan Foreign Travel Diary' - all dates mentioned below are lunar calendar dates converted to the solar calendar)\\n\\n○ The Conflicted Thinker\\n\\nOn January 26, Jeong Won-taek made contact with Jo So-ang, who was staying at a Taoist temple (道館, Taoist temple) in a remote area outside the east gate of Jilin Province. Seeing that he had made a Taoist temple his residence, this was indeed 'very much like So-ang.' Jo So-ang, with his notably large head, exuded the aura of a religious figure or thinker, unlike what one would expect from a Meiji University law graduate.\\n\\nChunwon Yi Gwang-su described his time living with Jo So-ang in Shanghai in 1913: 'He (Jo So-ang) would sit quietly on his bed reading the Quran, or otherwise sit with his eyes half-closed, swaying his body left and right.' (Yi Gwang-su's 'My Confession')\\n\\nAt that time, Jo So-ang was active as a teacher at Pakdal Academy operated by the Dongje Society, and whenever he had spare time, he would study world religions including Islam and philosophy, or enjoy meditation. In 1914, as part of the independence movement, he conceived an original religion called Yukseong-gyo [Six Saints Religion] that worshipped Dangun [legendary founder of Korea] and six sages from East and West, and even wrote religious texts called 'Ilsin-gyo-ryeong' [Monotheistic Religious Command]. So it wasn't particularly strange that Jo So-ang was staying at a Taoist temple where Taoist masters resided.\\n\\nThe weather in Jilin was still deep winter. The two men drank warm ginseng tea and shared their feelings after meeting for a long time. There had been an occasion when Jo So-ang was arrested by Chinese police in Manchuria as a suspicious person, and Jeong Won-taek had actively stepped forward to help him. After sharing various personal stories and finishing a cup of tea, Jeong Won-taek brought up the main topic.\\n\\n'Now, following communication instructions from Teacher Ye-gwan [Shin Gyu-sik], I am carrying some documents to rally Manchurian comrades and correspond secretly with the Russian territory [Maritime Province]. This is the important responsibility that Nam-pa [Park Chan-ik] and So-ang must undertake.'\\n\\nJeong Won-taek urged swift action, saying time was urgent. However, the reaction of Dongje Society agent Jo So-ang was unexpected.\\n\\n'When I came here from West Jiandao, I had made a resolution. I decided to hide in this Taoist temple from now on, not interfere with worldly affairs, not argue with people, and simply cultivate myself alone. Leave me be.'\\n\\nJo So-ang spoke calmly. Jeong Won-taek was shocked by these unexpected words. Wasn't this Jo So-ang, who had consistently carried out independence activities with Shin Gyu-sik from early on? His older brother Jo Yong-ha had gone into exile in China after the 1905 Eulsa Treaty was concluded and was conducting independence activities in Manchuria and America, while his younger brother Jo Yong-ju had also followed his brother (Jo So-ang) into exile and was active as an independence activist. Yet here he was, saying he would now quietly cultivate himself in seclusion.\\n\\nAt that time, Jo So-ang was in anguish.\\n\\n'As World War I was drawing to a close, overseas Korean communities had not even a hair's breadth of hope for unity, and the masses at home were also quietly without any sound. My heart was very anxious, so I resolved to rally Koreans in the Northeast region and went there alone. At that time, the big figures in the Korean expatriate community were each acting as heroes and maintaining separate territories, so there was no hope for unification and it ended in failure. Thus I secluded myself in Jilin Province and read books.' (Jo So-ang's 'Autobiography,' published in 1943)\\n\\nIn an essay he wrote after returning to Korea in 1946, reflecting on the period before and after the March 1st Movement of 1919, he recorded:\\n\\n'I deeply lamented and was disappointed by our nation's lack of unity. However, this was my hasty judgment and miscalculation. When that spirit matured and the timing was seized, I discovered and learned from the March 1st Movement that there is no nation with stronger unity than ours.' (Jo So-ang's 'The March 1st Movement and I,' Jayu Shinmun, February 26, 1946)\\n\\nUntil the flames of the March 1st Revolution ignited at home, Jo So-ang had moved beyond skepticism to almost despair about the inability of people of the same blood to unite.\\n\\n○ The Original Independence Declaration: The Daedong Unity Declaration\\n\\nThe Daedong Unity Declaration (left photo), with 14 independence activists including Shin Jeong (Shin Gyu-sik) and Jo Yong-eun (Jo So-ang) listed as initiators, is evaluated as the original independence declaration. The seal of the Dongje Society that led the Daedong Unity Declaration. Provided by Independence Hall of Korea and Gyeonggi Provincial Museum\\n\\nJo So-ang had good reason for this. His 'Declaration of Daedong Unity' (Daedong Unity Declaration), which contained his political beliefs, had returned as an empty echo despite countless efforts.\\n\\nIn July 1917, Jo So-ang drafted the Daedong Unity Declaration with comrades in Shanghai and distributed it to independence movement organizations at home and abroad. It was a declaration calling for convening domestic and international representative conferences to organize an institution called 'Musang-beopin' [Supreme Legal Person], namely a government, based on the principle that Daedong unity was essential for the independence movement above all else.\\n\\nKey figures of the Dongje Society were listed as initiators of the declaration. Led by Dongje Society leader Shin Gyu-sik, there were 14 people including Jo So-ang, Shin Seok-u, Park Yong-man, Park Eun-sik, Shin Chae-ho, Jo Seong-hwan, Kim Gyu-sik, and Yun Se-bok. Given that it was a declaration signed by renowned independence activists, its weight was considerable.\\n\\nParticularly, the Daedong Unity Declaration drafted by Jo So-ang contained content publicly and officially declaring that the sovereignty of the (Korean Empire) emperor had been transferred to the people. It clearly stated that the national polity to be established after national independence would be a nation of popular sovereignty, not a monarchical restoration.\\n\\n'The day when Emperor Yunghui [Sunjong] abandoned the three treasures [land, people, politics] - August 29 of the year Gyeongsul (1910) - is the very day our comrades inherited them, for not a moment did we stop breathing during that time. Our comrades are complete heirs, so the time of imperial authority's extinction is the time of popular rights' birth, and the last day of old Korea is the first day of new Korea. Why is this so? Our great Korea has been Korea for Koreans, not for non-Koreans, since time immemorial. The giving and receiving of sovereignty among Koreans is an unwritten constitutional law in history. The transfer of sovereignty to non-Koreans is fundamentally invalid and absolutely impermissible to Korea's national character.' ('Daedong Unity Declaration')\\n\\nThis was also a 'revolutionary' declaration that clearly presented the goals and direction of the independence movement, which had been stagnant at the time. In fact, when the Daedong Unity Declaration was published, the independence movement at home and abroad was facing its worst situation.\\n\\nIn 1911, as part of military rule, Japan fabricated an assassination attempt on Joseon Governor-General Terauchi Masatake and arrested en masse leaders of the Sinminhoe [New People's Association] organized by Ahn Chang-ho, Yi Dong-nyeong, Yi Seung-hun, and others. The Sinminhoe, an anti-Japanese nationalist organization in the northwestern region, was completely disbanded. This was the so-called '105-Person Incident.' Due to this incident, independence activists based domestically fled overseas, with Yi Seung-man going to America and Kim Gyu-sik to China. Subsequently, domestic resistance organizations like the Independence Army (1912-1914) and the Korean Restoration Association (1915-1918) were discovered one after another, leading to the collapse of the righteous army movement.\\n\\nOverseas conditions were also difficult. In 1915, Yi Sang-seol, Shin Gyu-sik, and others established the New Korea Revolutionary Party in China and attempted to create an exile government supporting Emperor Gwangmu [Gojong], but this was also discovered and came to nothing. It was around this time that a declaration completely ending the pro-imperial [bohwang] line of independence movement strategy centered on the Korean Empire's emperor was published.\\n\\nJo So-ang, who drafted the Daedong Unity Declaration, judged that since the duties and rights of the three treasures belonged to the people, a subject to exercise them was necessary. Since domestic compatriots were currently constrained by Japanese rule, overseas comrades must bear that responsibility, and for this purpose, he proposed that national representatives from various overseas regions hold conferences to establish the sole supreme institution. (Jo Dong-geol's 'The 1917 Daedong Unity Declaration for Establishing the Provisional Government')\\n\\nThis declaration later became the foundation for the independence declaration of the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. This is also why Shin Gyu-sik, director of the Dongje Society, and Park Eun-sik, president, named the Daedong Unity Declaration the 'First Shanghai Proclamation' in the inaugural issue of the weekly magazine 'Jindan' published in 1920, the year after the March 1st Movement, defining it as the first independence declaration.\\n\\nHowever, the response when the declaration was actually published was disappointing. Although the declaration would have been widely known through 'Sinhan Minbo' (North America), 'Gungmin-bo' (Hawaii), 'Hanin Shinbo' (Vladivostok), 'Cheonggu Shinbo' (Ussuriysk), almost no organizations responded. Jo So-ang was considerably disappointed.\\n\\nJo So-ang then went to China's Northeast region in 1918 to attempt unification of independence movement organizations based on Korean expatriate communities. This also failed. As he put it, not a single organization that acted as separate heroes responded.\\n\\nThis was a point that Dongje Society agent Park Chan-ik also felt.\\n\\n'Saying that military activities with armed force were important in the independence movement, everyone created armed organizations. Even someone with a few subordinates boasted of being an independence army commander, and those with 100 or 1,000 people also each showed off as independence army commanders. Even while walking the same path, each put forward their own theories and were reluctant to become one.' ('Biography of Nam-pa Park Chan-ik')\\n\\n○ 'The Opportunity to Make a Great Outcry Again Has Come'\\n\\nJeong Won-taek persuaded Jo So-ang, who said he would live by cultivating his spirit.\\n\\n'Whether it's me, you [Jo So-ang], or various other comrades, the reason we abandoned parents, wives, and children after the national humiliation and sweetly endured hardships and suffering while sleeping rough in the wind and rain in distant lands was all based on the saying that if one has will, it will eventually be achieved, awaiting the right time. Now the war clouds in the West have cleared for the first time and peace conferences are opening in Paris, with weak nations proclaiming self-determination. Though the work may be imperfect, the time has come. Don't calculate the success or failure of the work - this is the opportunity to rise once and make a great outcry. If we miss this opportunity, when will we wait for another? Secluded cultivation won't be too late even when old.'\\n\\nFinally, Jo So-ang's heart was moved. Jeong Won-taek and Jo So-ang met together with Park Chan-ik, who was staying at an inn, then discussed activity plans at the house of Yeo Jun (1862-1932) outside the north gate of Jilin Province.\\n\\nAt the end of February 1919, independence activists from West and North Jiandao secretly gathered at the house of Yeo Jun, former principal of Shinheung Military Academy. Some came after hearing rumors to contribute funds for the cause. A Mr. Kim from Pyongyang, who had come to Jilin for wasteland development business in Manchuria, provided 6,000 won [approximately $4,600 USD] from his funds. Also, Jeong Myeong-seon from Chungnam Province contributed 1,000 won [approximately $770 USD] to be used for the independence movement.\\n\\nFinally, on February 27, the Korean Independence Army was organized at Yeo Jun's house to carry out independence activities in earnest. Yeo Jun, who was the oldest, was elected as president, with Park Chan-ik as general affairs and foreign affairs, Hwang Sang-gyu as finance, Kim Jwa-jin as military affairs, Jeong Won-taek as clerical affairs, and Jeong Un-hae as propaganda and liaison. Jo So-ang was selected as the Jilin representative to be dispatched to Shanghai. ('Jisan Foreign Travel Diary')\\n\\nThe Korean Independence Army chose the line of armed resistance against Japan. Kim Jwa-jin, who would gain fame the following year (1920) in the 'Battle of Cheongsanri,' was responsible for purchasing horses and weapons needed for military force. Also, they decided to draft a Korean Independence Declaration under the leadership of the Korean Independence Army. Unlike Tokyo's February 8 Independence Declaration, they put the use of force at the forefront of the independence movement. This is how the declaration known as the 'Muo Independence Declaration' came to be born. (There is controversy about the publication date of the Korean Independence Declaration. We will examine this in the next issue.)\\n\\nAn Young-bae, Reporter ojong@donga.com\\n\\nA monument to Jo So-ang's sayings erected at Independence Hall of Korea.\\n\\nMain Characters\\n\\nJo So-ang:\\nBorn in Paju, Gyeonggi Province in 1887.

[Reporter Lee Hoon-gu, Dong-A Ilbo]\\n\\nExpectations that April would be cruel are rapidly reversing. This is due to the megaton-level warm winds of the inter-Korean summit at the end of April and the North Korea-US summit in May. Expectations emerge that this could melt the Cold War on the Korean Peninsula. However, there will be no shortage of obstacles. All dialogues with North Korea related to nuclear issues over the past 20-odd years have ended in failure. It would be good if this dialogue goes well and leads to denuclearization, but it may not turn out that way. This time, if the talks break down, it won't end there. The danger may become even greater. We intensively investigated recent US military movements.\\n\\n\\\"Either a genius or a communist\\\"\\n\\nBritish BBC broadcast reported on February 9 that US President Donald Trump accepted North Korean Workers' Party Chairman Kim Jong-un's proposal for talks, saying \\\"The political gamble of the 21st Century is unfolding.\\\" It then evaluated President Moon Jae-in, who mediated the North Korea-US dialogue, as \\\"either a diplomatic genius or a communist who destroys his own country.\\\" The forecast followed that \\\"if President Moon's efforts to mediate between North Korea and the US fail, we could return to the brink again.\\\"\\n\\nAccording to foreign media, the most important player in this gamble is Kim Jong-un. He may be a master of propaganda who waves the olive branch (message of peace). However, the main actor who forced Kim Jong-un to come to the negotiating table was probably President Trump. North Korean defectors report that North Korea's internal situation is heading toward the worst due to economic sanctions. Not only residents who make a living from over 1,000 marketplaces [jangmadang], but also officials who parasitically depend on them have seen their lives rapidly deteriorate.\\n\\nMost Workers' Party officials are said to sustain their lives by receiving bribes because monthly wage income of $10-20 is insufficient. With unprecedented sanctions cutting off their money sources, discontent among the ruling elite, including these officials, is said to be exploding.\\n\\nAccording to scholars who study socialist systems, the power dynamics between dictators and ruling elites are most important in such systems. In normal times, they maintain a transaction structure where dictators give goods as gifts to ruling elites and receive loyalty in return. Kim Jong-un also gives luxury items like Mercedes-Benz cars and trading rights to officials. This is similar to feudal kings granting trading rights to merchant operators who filled the royal treasury. However, when this transaction structure breaks down for any reason, some ruling elites become dissatisfied with the dictator. The dictator then falls into a situation where internal control becomes impossible and is eventually removed.\\n\\nCurrently, Kim Jong-un is driven into a situation where he cannot properly supply goods to North Korea's ruling elite due to serious sanctions. The transaction structure that sustains the system has begun to malfunction. The possibility of cracks emerging from within the Kim Jong-un regime is growing. With four UN sanctions last year, North Korea-China trade, which accounts for 90% of North Korea's trade, was cut in half compared to the previous year. Kim Jong-un and North Korea faced a situation of either starving to death or being beaten to death.\\n\\nCracks from within?\\n\\nSigns that North Korea was trying to shift to a peaceful phase were detected at the end of last year. North Korea launched the Hwasong-15, an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of attacking the US East Coast, on November 29 last year. However, this was a high-angle launch and was assessed as not having fully secured reentry technology for the warhead.\\n\\nAtmospheric reentry requires attitude control technology to enter at a 20-30 degree angle from vertical to reduce warhead friction, heat-resistant alloys and ablation technology to withstand 6,000-7,000 degrees of heat and partial erosion of the warhead. At the same time, detonation devices that cause nuclear fission and fusion reactions at desired target points and times must operate.\\n\\nHowever, North Korea is assessed as not yet having completed these technologies, which can be called the core of intercontinental ballistic missiles. This is because North Korea has not released detailed announcements regarding missile specifications. North Korea should have revealed results of precise analysis of the Hwasong-15 using measurement equipment and analysis fleets at the impact point.\\n\\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyzed in November last year that North Korea would need 3-6 months to complete reentry technology. Based on the end of November last year, the 6-month point is May this year. North Korea must do everything possible to complete missiles within this 6-month period. Trump pressured Kim Jong-un to take concrete denuclearization measures and accepted the summit meeting to coincide with the May deadline. Since North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles are not yet complete products, their value inevitably diminishes accordingly.\\n\\nNorth Korea declared completion of nuclear force through a government statement on November 29 last year. This means that a country seeking to possess nuclear weapons has gained the capability to achieve that goal. However, this declaration appears to be a political declaration made at the entrance to technical completion of nuclear force.\\n\\nNevertheless, North Korea is taking steps as a nuclear-armed state. In his New Year's address, Kim Jong-un said, \\\"We achieved the historic great work of completing national nuclear force,\\\" adding, \\\"It became a powerful deterrent that can block and respond to any nuclear threat and suppress the US from adventurous fire-playing.\\\" He was confident that \\\"the US can never wage war against me and our state.\\\"\\n\\nChosun Sinbo [the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan's newspaper], which represents North Korea's position, mentioned the North Korea-US summit on March 10. The newspaper said, \\\"Peace talks are about to begin that will put a permanent end to the invasion war commotion that the US, the main culprit of division, has been engaged in.\\\" Regarding the background, it claimed, \\\"While Trump has hinted at the possibility of military action against Korea [North Korea], in reality he had no choice but to avoid armed conflict and dialogue with nuclear-armed Korea [North Korea].\\\" It argued that the US could no longer delay dialogue because North Korea completed nuclear weapons. However, for some reason, the full text of Chosun Sinbo's article was deleted after just one day.\\n\\nMunich Syndrome\\n\\nOn September 29, 1939, British Prime Minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain brought back the Munich Agreement containing provisions to hand over Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region to Germany. He praised the Munich Agreement signed by Adolf Hitler as \\\"glorious peace.\\\" In response, Winston Churchill said it was \\\"surrendering to Nazi violence threats\\\" and \\\"it's a ridiculous delusion to think you can feel secure by throwing a small piece of meat to a pack of wolves.\\\"\\n\\nGermany annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia in March the year after signing the Munich Agreement and invaded Poland in April. It was the beginning of World War II. Chamberlain's misjudgment is called the 'Munich Syndrome,' representing the limitations of appeasement policy.\\n\\nSeveral security experts positively evaluate the results of this special envoy delegation's agreement while also recalling Munich Syndrome. This is because such risks always accompany negotiations with dictators. While Chamberlain at least brought back documents, this inter-Korean agreement doesn't even have documents. North Korean authorities and media outlets have not confirmed the agreement content even after considerable time has passed since the agreement emerged. Korea trusted only Kim Jong-un's words and mediated with President Trump, leading Trump to accept the North Korea-US summit. If it goes well, it's Nobel Peace Prize material. However, as BBC said, if it goes wrong, not only North Korea but also Korea will be driven to an even deeper precipice. I am concerned about this point.\\n\\nIn fact, there are many suspicious aspects to Kim Jong-un's sudden reversal. North Korea has frequently broken important agreements in the past. The July 4 Joint Statement signed in 1972 and the Basic Agreement became waste paper. The 1991 Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was also treated like an old shoe. The 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework that resolved the first nuclear crisis was also scrapped. The September 19 Joint Statement that emerged from the Six-Party Talks in 2005 also became useless due to subsequent nuclear tests. The subsequent February 13 Agreement and October 3 Agreement specifically promised to mark, seal, report, dismantle, and verify nuclear facilities. In June 2008, North Korea blew up the Yongbyon reactor cooling tower. However, these agreements and the explosion also ended as shows.\\n\\nNorth Korea has used the typical negotiation tactics of communists who agree on principles and then pick fights over specifics. In 2012, the US and North Korea reached the February 29 Agreement supporting North Korean infants and young children. North Korea then fired a long-range missile less than two months later. All agreements signed with North Korea have ultimately failed. This is North Korea, which overnight nullifies even the armistice agreement that has the character of an international treaty. North Korea's history of breaking agreements is too brilliant. There is no guarantee anywhere that this agreement won't be broken.\\n\\nAccording to the special envoy delegation, Kim Jong-un attached conditions of 'eliminating military threats' and 'guaranteeing regime security' when discussing denuclearization. These are words North Korea has repeatedly claimed. North Korea has said almost nothing about 'how to eliminate military threats and guarantee regime security.' This part is highly likely to become a minefield.\\n\\nFurthermore, North Korea cannot easily give up nuclear weapons due to current internal circumstances. North Korea called itself a 'nuclear-armed state' in its 2012 constitutional revision and enacted the so-called 'Nuclear Possession Law' in 2013, officially titled 'Law on Consolidating the Position as a Self-Defensive Nuclear-Armed State.' Having promoted nuclear possession to be ingrained in North Korean people's minds, it won't be easy to suddenly decide to abandon nuclear weapons. Rather, North Korean media have remained silent about the summit agreement while reporting that \\\"nuclear force is a sword of justice\\\" and \\\"we won't beg the US for dialogue even after 100 years.\\\"\\n\\nNorth Korea's conciliatory policy has always been part of a time-buying strategy. There are signs this time was no different. Two strategic directions were adopted at the Workers' Party Central Committee plenary meeting at the end of last year: 'how to make nuclear possession a fait accompli' and 'how to overcome sanctions.' It is highly likely that they shifted to a peaceful phase to neutralize sanctions and buy time.\\n\\nNorth Korea has used South Korea whenever it faced difficulties. In the 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed and North Korea faced economic difficulties, it changed its attitude, adopted the Basic Agreement and made the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It then safely passed through the Arduous March [North Korea's famine period in the 1990s]. UN Security Council resolutions on sanctions against North Korea number 11 so far. They are tremendously comprehensive and extensive. These sanctions appear to have North Korea cornered as they pile up around North Korea's neck.\\n\\n\\\"Came to Korea as 3rd Division member\\\"\\n\\nNorth Korean-flagged tanker and small vessel conducting illegal oil trade in the East China Sea on February 16. [Japan Ministry of Defense]\\n\\nConsidering these points, the special envoy delegation's announcement is important, but we can barely believe it only when North Korea shows visible and concrete nuclear dismantlement actions. Indeed, even though President Trump accepted the North Korea-US summit, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders emphasized on March 9, \\\"The US will continue maximum pressure on North Korea, and if North Korea doesn't show actions consistent with denuclearization will, we won't pursue talks.\\\" She then drew a line saying, \\\"The US is not currently in a negotiation phase with North Korea\\\" and \\\"The US responded to North Korea's dialogue request on the premise that North Korea keeps its promises.\\\" Even with a summit scheduled with North Korea, US pressure on North Korea continues. Signs of being prepared for war are not relaxing.\\n\\nMr. A, a US military non-commissioned officer who served at the 2nd Infantry Division and was transferred to the US mainland last summer, returned to Korea in the first week of March, less than a year later. This is the same Mr. A from the March issue of 'Shin Dong-A' who \\\"couldn't bring his family this time and came to Korea alone.\\\" I recently met and spoke with Mr. A. He said, \\\"I came to Korea as a member of the 3rd Division, not the 2nd Division.\\\" When I confirmed, it is true that a US Army 3rd Division unit came to Korea for the first time since the Korean War. The US Army 3rd Division 1st Brigade stationed at Fort Stewart base in Georgia has been rotationally deployed to Korea for 9 months. This matches AP's January 13 report that a US Army tank brigade from Georgia was being rotationally deployed to Korea. While Koreans think of the 2nd Infantry Division when considering US Forces Korea, it has been confirmed for the first time that the 3rd Division, which primarily handles ground warfare, came to Korea.\\n\\nUnits deployed on rotation for less than 9 months (Rotation Unit) are typically prohibited from bringing families. That's why Mr. A, a US Forces Korea member, came to Korea alone without family accompaniment this time. Regarding the controversy over prohibiting new US Forces Korea deployments from bringing families, it's confirmed that one of the US military's personnel methods of rotation deployment for less than 9 months was applied to units coming to Korea this time.\\n\\nMr. A told me, \\\"As soon as we were deployed to Korea, we've been strengthening training to war preparation levels, extending even to nighttime.\\\" Training reportedly continues through holidays. Mr. A also said, \\\"I don't know if I can rest next Sunday.\\\"\\n\\nBased on my experience working with and training with US military units, US troops almost always rest on holidays. If they train continuously through holidays, they usually have training holidays on weekdays to rest. However, since March, US Forces Korea personnel and reconnaissance aircraft have been training and operating during holidays, late nights, and early mornings. This doesn't necessarily mean they will definitely wage war, but they are conducting live-fire training at a level where they could immediately conduct war if necessary.\\n\\nThe US 3rd Division rotationally deployed to US Forces Korea this time successfully performed the mission of capturing Baghdad through bold flanking approaches as the main attacking division during the Iraq War in March 2003. At that time, there were 6 Iraqi corps and 15 divisions around the 3rd Division's advance toward Baghdad. However, these Iraqi forces could not stop the 3rd Division's advance in joint operations with naval and air forces at all. Due to stark differences in equipment and operations, Iraqi forces collapsed from the beginning. The deployment of the 3rd Division's main armored combat brigade, which has extensive combat experience and captured Baghdad in just 3 weeks after the war began, to Korea through rotation is not ordinary.\\n\\nElite armored units and joint naval-air operations methods\\n\\nRecently, talk around the US military suggests \\\"if the North Korea-US summit breaks down, the US will maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea while fully implementing maritime interdiction.\\\" The US seeks to consolidate international capabilities, considering that past maritime interdiction operations had little effect. Specifically, it will maximally organize UN Command force-contributing nations. The US held a foreign ministers' meeting of 20 countries including Korean War participants in Vancouver, Canada on January 15-16, grouping them as the Vancouver Group. When maritime interdiction is implemented in earnest, these countries' navies are expected to conduct joint operations with US forces.\\n\\nThe 'comprehensive maritime interdiction' announced by the US on February 23 targets 28 vessels flagged by North Korea, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Panama, along with 27 companies including shipping companies and one individual. This is evaluated as the strongest pressure measure short of military action.\\n\\nIn relation to this, the UK Treasury placed 16 North Korean individuals and 1 organization involved in the Hwasong-15 ICBM launch at the end of last year on its sanctions list. Australia investigated its domestic real estate company 'Brit Australia' on March 8 for allegedly violating sanctions by shipping North Korean coal disguised as Russian coal. India added items to economic sanctions against North Korea on March 7.\\n\\nUS maritime interdiction has essentially begun. The US is strengthening pressure by photographing and publicizing North Korean vessels conducting transshipment using artificial satellites and reconnaissance satellites. The US also released photos of the North Korean Geumbyeol Trade-affiliated Ryesong River 1 conducting transshipment, taken on October 19, 2017, on the Treasury Department website on November 22, 2017. Submarines are deployed to areas difficult to observe by satellite. Vancouver Group naval forces are being mobilized for this.\\n\\n\\\"It has been confirmed that Canada deployed submarines to operations monitoring maritime trade that helps North Korea's nuclear and missile development,\\\" reported Canadian public broadcaster CBC on February 6. According to CBC, the Canadian Navy's diesel-electric submarine 'HMCS Chicoutimi' has been conducting operations monitoring vessels that could help North Korea in waters near the Korean Peninsula since February. This submarine observes high-seas transshipment that North Korea frequently uses while tracking not only warships but also commercial vessels.\\n\\nCurrently, the Reagan Carrier Strike Group and Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group are deployed around the Korean Peninsula. However, visible forces are not everything. It's impossible to know how many countries' submarines are operating in the East Sea area for maritime interdiction. Some experts say \\\"the East Sea has become a 'submarine paradise.'\\\" As maritime interdiction strengthens, losses to the North Korean economy will inevitably grow.\\n\\n8 Aegis ships mobilized for 'North Korean missile interception'\\n\\nThere's also talk that if North Korea drags out time without taking visible denuclearization measures, the US will resort to direct physical sanctions. A representative measure is maritime blockade. This measure could be implemented simultaneously with blocking smuggling in the North Korea-China border region.\\n\\nCountries that would primarily engage in this maritime blockade are the US, Japan, Britain, Australia, and Canada. India might also participate. Some experts predict Korea would take an ambiguous attitude. The story is that Korea would participate at a level of seeking US understanding while not engaging in actual force, concerned about dampening momentum for the inter-Korean summit at the end of April.\\n\\nMaritime blockade could drive North Korea into a withering situation. It also tightens psychologically. The maritime blockade process involves blocking vessels traveling to and from North Korea, which requires using force. For this, all vessels entering and leaving North Korea would be stopped and searched by participating countries' naval forces. Armed personnel on North Korean vessels, mainly North Korean soldiers, would resist during this process. Combat with them would be unavoidable and casualties could occur.\\n\\nNorth Korea would oppose such maritime blockade. If accidental clashes occur before the inter-Korean summit at the end of April, the inter-Korean summit cannot be optimistic. North Korea might conduct military provocations against South Korea and Japan or carry out nuclear and missile tests. However, if atmospheric reentry technology is not completed, North Korea would likely buy time until May by responding to the inter-Korean summit.\\n\\nHowever, whether delayed to April or May, North Korea's armed resistance makes maritime blockade stronger. This is because the strongest forces, including US strategic assets participating in Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises, are already deployed and training in Korean Peninsula waters and nearby seas in April and May. If maritime blockade is implemented, the Carl Vinson Strike Group and Reagan Strike Group would also participate.\\n\\nIf North Korea responds to maritime blockade by conducting ICBM or submarine-launched ballistic missile tests, the US would likely intercept these missiles or strike launch points before launch this time. This is because such North Korean provocations have already crossed America's red line. North Korea's ballistic missile launches are already prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, and the UN and international community have issued numerous warnings about North Korean ballistic missile launches. The US also has grounds to utilize such international consensus.\\n\\nSpecifically, the US would bring forces into the East Sea capable of neutralizing North Korean ballistic missiles and launchers during Korea-US joint military exercises. At least 8 or more US and Japanese Aegis ships could be mobilized to intercept North Korean missiles. To strike North Korean ballistic missile launch sites, B-1B strategic bombers and F-35B vertical takeoff and landing stealth fighters could frequently fly over the East Sea.\\n\\nPossibilities of reducing Korea-US joint exercises are being discussed domestically following the series of summits. However, the US is actually strengthening participating forces and scale. F-35B stealth fighters aboard US amphibious assault ships will participate for the first time in Korea-US joint amphibious landing exercises conducted as part of Foal Eagle training. F-35B can precisely strike strategic targets like Pyongyang's presidential palace while evading North Korea's radar network, and the Wasp-class ship carrying 6-20 F-35Bs would become core US forces if preventive war breaks out. The amphibious exercise scale is also reportedly more than doubling from last year, reflecting the US position of continuing sanctions and 'maximum pressure' until substantial progress in denuclearization occurs.\\n\\nSince last year, the US has completed preliminary rehearsals for preemptive strikes by flying B-1B bombers and F-15 fighters beyond the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the East Sea. F-35B is particularly powerful in secretly taking off and infiltrating North Korean airspace. US aircraft carrier-based aircraft also appear to have partially switched from some F-18E/F to F-35B. This appears in President Trump's speech to the Korean National Assembly in November last year.\\n\\nNo-fly zone establishment is a military operation signal\\n\\nDecember 6, 2017: 2 Korean Air Force F-16s, 2 F-15Ks, 1 US B-1B, 2 F-35As, and 2 F-35Bs (from left) flying in formation over Korean Peninsula airspace. (Above) F-35B vertical takeoff and landing stealth fighter. [Air Force]\\n\\n\\\"Currently, the world's three largest aircraft carriers are deployed around the Korean Peninsula with F-35 and F-18 fighters loaded.\\\"\\n\\nIf US carrier-based aircraft are changing to F-35s, this would be an enormous burden for North Korea.\\n\\nSome US military officials also suggest \\\"if the North Korea-US summit fails to achieve North Korean denuclearization, the US could declare a no-fly zone over all North Korean territory.\\\" During the 2003 Iraq War, the US pre-established a No Fly Zone over Iraq, shooting down fighter aircraft flying within Iraq and systematically removing Iraq's anti-aircraft weapons. If the US establishes a no-fly zone over North Korea, this would be accepted as a signal for military operations.\\n\\nElimination of Kim Jong-un by US forces (decapitation operation) could be carried out decisively when Kim Jong-un appears at external events. According to military authorities, most of Kim Jong-un's external activities are known. One official said, \\\"If we track Kim Jong-un's movements for about 1-2 months, we can accurately know his external activities. Decapitation operations can succeed.\\\" It would be more effective with US special forces including the 75th Ranger Regiment, Delta Force, or Navy SEALs. US nuclear-powered submarines carry Navy SEAL teams and submarines that secretly infiltrate them. Navy SEALs killed Bin Laden and buried him in the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nThe Moon Jae-in government is reportedly closer to the position that decapitation operations can be conducted when North Korea actually provokes. However, US hardliners have openly revealed that decapitation operations could be conducted before North Korea mounts nuclear warheads on ICBMs. Ultimately, if the US judges decapitation operations unavoidable, it might carry them out unilaterally regardless of the Moon Jae-in government's intentions.\\n\\nPresident Trump might try to surgically remove North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles. It's reportedly being reviewed as roughly 6 stages: \\\"△Disabling communication and power networks of North Korea's war leadership with e-bombs, EMP bombs, and graphite bombs, △Destroying North Korea's nuclear and missile manufacturing and storage facilities with Tomahawk and other long-range precision strike missiles, △Destroying North Korea's medium-high altitude air defense network, △Deploying Global Hawk over North Korean airspace, △Real-time elimination of fleeing North Korean missile mobile launchers with stealth fighters, △Destroying Punggye-ri nuclear test site in South Hamgyong Province with MOAB bombs and bunker busters.\\\"\\n\\nKorea-US disagreement on decapitation operations?\\n\\nNorth Korean long-range artillery unit firing scene. [Rodong Sinmun, Dong-A DB]\\n\\nThe most important condition for this military option is utilizing US forces outside the Korean Peninsula. This is due to the armistice agreement. If US Forces Korea intervene, they would cross the ceasefire line and directly violate the armistice agreement. The US Forces Korea commander who also serves as UN Command commander simultaneously handles Korean Peninsula defense missions and armistice agreement management missions. If US forces under such a UN commander cross borders, they would violate the armistice agreement themselves, giving China grounds to intervene as a party to the agreement.\\n\\nTherefore, to block Chinese intervention on the Korean Peninsula, the US might try to handle North Korea's nuclear weapons as international non-proliferation issues and direct threats to the US, dealing with them from a self-defense perspective. There's also talk that the US won't withdraw participating forces even after Foal Eagle training ends.\\n\\nIf most of North Korea's ballistic missiles were removed, North Korea's means of retaliation would be long-range artillery deployed north of the Seoul metropolitan area. When Yongbyon bombing theories emerged in 1994, Korean and US forces did not have means to quickly suppress North Korea's long-range artillery.\\n\\nResponse capabilities have greatly improved now. The military views North Korea's long-range artillery north of the Seoul area as about 340 guns and knows their locations inside out. Operational plans have been established for Korean and US artillery, missiles, and fighter aircraft to attack long-range artillery tunnels and firing positions. At this rate, most long-range artillery would be eliminated within 2-3 days. Long-range artillery has only one round loaded for firing, with remaining shells in tunnels. Destroying tunnel entrances eliminates shells for reloading long-range artillery.\\n\\nOperational and intelligence experts judge that North Korean long-range artillery could fire a maximum of 3,000-5,000 rounds toward the Seoul area in one volley during contingencies. An estimated one-third of these shells could hit buildings. This is because road and open space areas are larger than building areas. Long-range artillery cannot penetrate concrete walls. The Seoul area has abundant places to take shelter, including subways, underground parking lots, and behind concrete buildings. If early warning systems operate well, damage can be reduced. If North Korea's war leadership is paralyzed, expansion to full-scale war would be difficult. Some argue the US couldn't wage war due to war cost issues. However, that's the case for full-scale or prolonged war.\\n\\nKorea bears burden of guaranteeing Kim Jong-un...\\n\\nI hope the two summits proceed well and North Korean denuclearization is realized. However, the agreement brought by the special envoy delegation has many minefields. There's also risk of being driven to an even steeper precipice if summits don't proceed well. President Trump created a situation where Korea guaranteed Kim Jong-un's denuclearization will by having National Security Advisor Chung Eui-yong make the announcement. Though this shouldn't happen, if by any chance the North Korea-US summit goes wrong, responsibility could fall on Korea. Korea's voice would weaken and possibilities for US-led preventive war would grow.\\n\\nKim Ki-ho\\n●Graduate of Korea Military Academy (35th class), retired Army Colonel\\n●Strategic planning officer at Joint Chiefs of Staff Strategic Staff\\n●Operations Planning Division Chief at Korea-US Combined Forces Command\\n●Professor at National Defense University Graduate School of National Security, Department of Military Strategy\\n●Current KBS guest commentator, visiting professor at Kyonggi University Graduate School of Politics\\n| Kim Ki-ho, Visiting Professor at Kyonggi University Graduate School of Politics missionhero@naver.com\\n《This article appeared in the April issue of Shin Dong-A》\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 14755, "output_tokens": 6839, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

I will serve the people and bring peace to the nation. I will develop the economy and integrate society. I will promote culture and advance science and technology. I will strengthen security and lay the foundation for peaceful unification. I will fulfill our responsibilities in the international community and contribute to the prosperity of humanity.\\n\\n▲ Video provided by KTV\\n▲ Video coverage: Park Tae-geun, Donga.com reporter\\n\\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Korea. We regained our lost land and established our nation, and we risked our lives to protect that nation. Everyone lived earnestly as one. Thus, we simultaneously achieved the tasks of industrialization and democratization in the shortest period in world history. We accomplished this solely with our will and our strength. The poorest country on earth became one of the world's top 10 economic powers. We rose from a country that received help to a country that gives help. Now we can stand shoulder to shoulder with advanced nations.\\n\\nOthers call this a 'miracle.' They also call it a 'myth.' But we know. It is not a miracle, but the crystallization of blood, sweat, and tears we all shed together. It is not a myth, but the true story of the life we have lived. It is the tearfully great story of our ancestors who gave their lives for independence, the soldiers who died on the battlefield, the farmers who cultivated the land under scorching sun and rain and wind, the workers who guarded industrial sites day and night, and the young people who devoted their youth to achieving democratization.\\n\\nThe citizens who brought out gold jewelry from their wardrobes to face the foreign exchange crisis, the volunteers who collected and cleaned oil on winter beaches, and the countless office workers and public officials who silently performed their assigned duties in various areas of society—all of them are the protagonists of Korea's success story. Now we can tell these stories openly. These are stories we tell with gratitude but also with dignity. This pride is the strength of Korea that opens the future.\\n\\nNow, I want to find and open the path to the future with confidence together with you. I want to break free from the shackles of the past, view the constraints of reality with composure, and advance together toward future possibilities.\\n\\nRespected citizens!\\n\\nAs President of the Republic of Korea, I declare 2008, the first year of starting a new 60 years, as the inaugural year of Korea's advancement. I declare a solemn beginning toward a country overflowing with abundance, consideration, and dignity—a society where we cherish the fruits of industrialization and democratization, where each person fulfills their own role, and where we cooperate for public welfare.\\n\\nFor the past 10 years, we sometimes hesitated and experienced setbacks, but now we will start again, making even the pain of failure as well as the joy of achievement our assets. We must move beyond the 'era of ideology' to the 'era of pragmatism.' The pragmatic spirit is a rational principle that penetrates the history of East and West, and practical wisdom effective in navigating the waves of globalization. It is the zeitgeist that realizes a life where humans and nature, material and spirit, individuals and communities harmoniously and beautifully come together.\\n\\nIn achieving Korea's advancement, there is no separation between you and me, no discrimination between us and them. With a pragmatic spirit toward cooperation and harmony, I want to melt class conflicts and resolve hardline struggles. A country where the government serves the people with sincerity, where the economy runs vigorously, where labor and management unite as one to warmly care for minorities and the weak, where we nurture excellent talent to send to the world and attract the world's talent—this is the vision of Korea I envision. This is the dream of an advanced first-class nation that the Lee Myung-bak administration seeks to achieve.\\n\\nThe miracle will continue. The myth will carry on. I will reignite the engine of development that amazed the world and make it run even more vigorously. If I take the lead and you, the people, unite and step forward, we can certainly achieve it.\\n\\nRespected citizens! At this point, there is something we must resolve together. We must coldly recognize the rapidly changing trends of the times and renew our determination to change ourselves. While we were complacent, the world has moved far ahead of us. Late-developing countries are also closely pursuing us. National competitiveness is declining, and instability in resources and financial markets threatens our economy.\\n\\nDomestic circumstances are also not easy. The middle class has shrunk and ordinary people's lives have become difficult. Relations between classes and groups are still mired in the swamp of conflict and struggle. Civil society has grown quantitatively, but claims of rights are outpacing sense of responsibility. A low birth rate and aging society is coming. The burden we bear as a divided nation is also heavy.\\n\\nAt this crossroads that will determine our national fortune for the next 60 years, to smoothly overcome this historic turning point, I request that you, the people, take more active steps toward change. If we neglect change, we will fall behind. If we resist change, we will be swept away. We must ride the flow of change and create change. Even if it is difficult and painful, we must change faster. If something is unreasonable or does not fit the times, we must boldly part with familiar things. The direction is openness, autonomy, and creativity.\\n\\nRespected citizens! Reviving the economy is most urgent. We must secure new growth engines to grow more vigorously and create more jobs.\\n\\nI want to transform the government first into a competent organization. I will increase efficiency with a 'small government, big market.' I will create a 'government that works well.' From now on, the government will help those who do well to do even better and serve as a source of strength where help is needed. I will transfer to the private sector what is not necessarily the government's job. I will introduce competition to the public sector as well. Taxes must also be lowered. Only then will investment and consumption revive. I will gradually reduce the number of civil servants and quickly eliminate unnecessary regulations. Citizens will soon see the new government working efficiently.\\n\\nBusinesses are the source of national wealth and the protagonists of job creation. Anyone should be able to easily start a business and build factories. I will improve market and institutional environments so that business leaders can step forward to invest and enthusiastically traverse world markets. Small and medium enterprises pursuing technological innovation must be invigorated. I will help them grow into mid-sized companies to cooperate and compete with large corporations. Business leaders who manage transparently and fairly should be respected, and companies that invest and create jobs should be loved.\\n\\nLabor and management are the two wheels that move the cart called business. If either fails to do its part, the cart overturns. In advanced countries, labor disputes have dramatically decreased. This is because both labor and management share the recognition that 'radical struggle ultimately brings self-destruction.' Autonomous improvement of labor-management culture is an essential requirement for advancement. Now we must end the 'era of struggle' and open the 'era of partnership.' Both businesses and unions must make concessions and approach each other step by step.\\n\\nEspecially during difficult times, businesses must exert strength. Businesses must first embrace workers with transparent and fair management. At such times, workers must also work harder. They must avoid illegal struggles and increase productivity. Only then will labor-management relations become healthy. The government will also work with principles and sincerity.\\n\\nMarket opening is an unavoidable major trend. As a country where export industries account for a large portion of the economy, we must increase national wealth through free trade agreements. However, there are many concerns in sectors vulnerable to opening. Farmers and fishermen particularly feel this way. But we cannot just sit down here, can we?\\n\\nAll of us Koreans are sons and daughters of farmers and fishermen. Concerns about agriculture, rural areas, and farmers are concerns about the nation. The government will work together in preparing countermeasures. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries must no longer remain primary industries. We must upgrade them to competitive secondary and tertiary industries by incorporating advanced production technology and combining them with distribution service management. We must also step forward boldly in pioneering overseas markets. If farmers, fishermen, and the government unite in purpose and pool wisdom, we could even make this an opportunity to turn misfortune into fortune.\\n\\nRespected citizens! Everyone should enjoy a life worthy of human dignity, and we should all become a healthy and comfortable society. The state must care for those who desperately need help. Charity-based, reactive welfare is not the solution. We must move toward active, preventive welfare. Only then can we create a world without dropouts. Benefits will go to those who truly need them.\\n\\nWomen are dignified protagonists of civil society and national development. Women's social participation makes society mature. I will promote gender equality policies and work to expand citizenship and social rights. I will increase opportunities and improve related systems so that more women can reach decision-making positions.\\n\\nI want to build a customized childcare system tailored to needs according to life cycles and living circumstances. If the government relieves the burden of childcare, not only will the low birth rate problem improve, but we can also enhance quality of life and human resources.\\n\\nI will not turn away from the suffering of the younger generation. I will help young people enter society by creating more jobs domestically and internationally. By stabilizing housing life, I will secure the foundation for stability not only in personal life but also in society. Welfare measures for the elderly are also urgent as we face an aging society. I will make old-age pensions realistic and improve public welfare. I will increase medical benefits and facilities for the elderly and work to create jobs for seniors who have the will to work.\\n\\nI also want to give disabled people warmer consideration along with more opportunities. For those who can work, jobs are the best welfare. For those who cannot do so, the state will take responsibility and care for them.\\n\\nRespected citizens! Advancement is done by people. And it is done for people. Korea's advancement depends on how many excellent talents we can secure.\\n\\nYoung people are the power generators of dreams and vitality who will shoulder Korea's future. I will actively work to develop young people's aptitude and potential and strengthen their digital and global capabilities.\\n\\nEducational reform is most urgent. We must break away from uniform government-controlled education and closed entrance exam-focused education. We must accept global standards and breathe the spirit of autonomy, creativity, and competition into educational sites. I will focus on diversifying school types and enhancing teachers' competitiveness. Only then will public education be normalized and the private education [hagwon education] craze subside. Students' aptitude and creativity will come alive.\\n\\nUniversity autonomy is key not only to national competitiveness but also to the advancement of Korean society. We must increase educational and research capabilities to compete fiercely with universities around the world. We must stand at the forefront of a knowledge-based society. We must qualitatively expand educational opportunities. Even those in difficult circumstances should be able to study. I will break the cycle of poverty through educational welfare.\\n\\nScience rationally changes and advances society. Some of Korea's science and technology has reached world-class levels, but we still have a long way to go. Looking ahead 20 to 30 years, I will cultivate creative capabilities in science and technology. I will nurture excellent science students and create a social climate that respects and treats scientists well. Science and technology opens the door to the future. The state must support research and development in basic science, source technology, and large-scale technology with long-term plans. I will also seek ways to make research and development cooperation systems between universities, businesses, and government more substantial.\\n\\nHousing is not property but infrastructure for living. I will actively pursue housing welfare policies that improve the level of residential life and stabilize housing prices. I want to reorganize the structure of national territory in a future-oriented way. Ocean orientation and regionalization are global trends. We must also prepare spatial utilization plans necessary for future lifestyles. In any case, I will maintain eco-friendly and culture-friendly principles to enhance the health and dignity of national territory.\\n\\nEnvironmental conservation improves quality of life, and environmental industries create new growth engines. Global environmental changes are threatening humanity. Weather disasters are becoming more frequent and their scale of damage is growing. We too must actively participate in reducing carbon emissions. Our economy will experience difficulties at first to adapt to this. However, we must endure that pain and adapt creatively. We must change overall policies related to food, environment, water, resources, energy, etc. in an environmentally friendly direction.\\n\\nOur country is a cultural nation with a long history. The Korean Wave [Hallyu], which has recently attracted attention on the world stage, is connected to such tradition. Only when modernization of traditional culture and advancement of culture and arts go together will economic prosperity also shine. Culture is now also an industry. We must enhance the competitiveness of the content industry to lay the foundation for a cultural powerhouse. When cultural levels rise, the dignity of life increases. We must enjoy with culture, harmonize with culture, and develop with culture. The government wants to do its best so that the potential of our culture can bloom fully in the open space of the 21st century.\\n\\nRespected citizens! The Republic of Korea will pursue global diplomacy that engages and exchanges with the international community with a broader perspective and more active attitude. We will become friends with all countries and all people in the world, transcending differences in race, religion, and wealth. While respecting the common human values of democracy and market economy, we will participate in the peace and development of the global village.\\n\\nWith the United States, we will develop and strengthen our traditional friendly relationship into a future-oriented alliance relationship. Based on the historical trust formed between the two countries, we will solidify our strategic alliance relationship. Solidarity with Asian countries is also very important. Especially, we will strengthen cooperative relationships with Japan, China, and Russia equally to seek peace and common prosperity in East Asia.\\n\\nTo operate the engine of our economy stably, we will also work to secure resources and energy stably. In addition, we will lead international cooperation for peace and environment. Befitting our economic scale and diplomatic capabilities, we will pursue contributory diplomacy that realizes universal human values. We will actively participate in UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) and expand official development assistance (ODA).\\n\\nBy emphasizing cultural diplomacy, we will make communication with the international community smoother. When our traditional culture and cutting-edge technology come together, we will be able to showcase Korea's charm to the world.\\n\\nUnification between North and South is the aspiration of 70 million people. Inter-Korean relations must develop more productively than before. We will approach this not with ideological standards but with pragmatic standards. Our goal is for residents of both North and South Korea to live happily and to lay the foundation for unification. As revealed in the 'Denuclearization and Opening 3000 Initiative,' if North Korea abandons nuclear weapons and chooses the path of opening, new horizons will open for inter-Korean cooperation. In cooperation with the international community, we will help North Korean residents' income reach $3,000 within 10 years. I believe that is the way to care for our compatriots and the way to hasten unification.\\n\\nPolitical leaders of North and South must share thoughts on how to help 70 million people live well, and how to open the door to unification while respecting each other. For such work, I think North and South summits should meet anytime and talk with open hearts. That opportunity remains open.\\n\\nThe foundation of politics lies in making people comfortable and giving them zest for life. However, politics is not meeting people's expectations. We cannot create an advanced first-class nation without politics changing. We must create and present the nation's development direction and practical alternatives. We must relieve people's livelihood hardships and give hope. This is the foundation of pragmatic politics.\\n\\nThe road looks long. However, let's start with what's possible. Let's boldly break with wasteful political practices. Let's take care of productive work that upholds the people's will and relieves the people's suffering. I will wide open the door to dialogue beyond ruling and opposition parties. I will cooperate with the National Assembly and respect the judiciary's intentions.\\n\\nRespected citizens! A rural boy who had difficulty even connecting meals became a street vendor, worked his way through school, was a day laborer, a salaryman, and went through being a major corporation chairman, National Assembly member, and Mayor of Seoul. And he became President of the Republic of Korea. Like this, Korea is a country where you can dream. And it is a country where you can realize those dreams.\\n\\nI hope all Korean citizens will have dreams. And I hope they will work hard to realize them. I want to make this precious land overflow with opportunities. A country where there is hope even in poverty, a country where you can get back up even after falling, a country where success opportunities are guaranteed to any citizen who works hard with sweat—I want to create such a country.\\n\\nI will expand the map of Korea in people's hearts to the world. I will let the world's civilization enter this land without obstruction and be created as new values. Thus, I will make Korea a country that sends new values to the world, an advanced first-class nation. This is the wish of our predecessors, the hope of our generation, and a promise to future generations. I, Lee Myung-bak, will lead the way.\\n\\nIt is difficult with government power alone. Citizens must step forward together. Each person must take action themselves. Parents must raise their children's bodies and minds more robustly. Teachers must teach students more earnestly. Business leaders and workers must join hands and advance more progressively. Young people must work harder for self-development. Soldiers and police must guard the nation and society more faithfully. Religious leaders, civic activists, and journalists must also shoulder heavier responsibilities. Public officials must serve the people more wholeheartedly. I will work hard starting with the president.\\n\\nRespected citizens! Our epochal task, the great advance toward Korea's advancement, has begun. Beyond the Miracle on the Han River, let us all move forward together toward a new myth of the Korean Peninsula. I, Lee Myung-bak, will lead the way. If the people unite and rise up together, we can achieve it. It will certainly happen. Thank you.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2008\\nPresident of the Republic of Korea, Lee Myung-bak\\n▲ Video provided by KTV\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11052, "output_tokens": 4606, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

If you perform well in the vocabulary and grammar section that other test-takers find difficult, the path to admission becomes that much easier.》\\n\\nVocabulary-Spacing Frequently Tested... Understand Principles → Develop Application Skills\\n\\n○ Types of Vocabulary and Grammar Problems\\nThe standards that serve as principles for the vocabulary and grammar field can be considered as those presented by the National Institute of Korean Language. The National Institute of Korean Language is a government-affiliated organization responsible for the Korean language purification movement, presenting dictionary standards and establishing frameworks that serve as criteria for grammar. When studying the vocabulary and grammar field, it's good to use the materials presented by the National Institute of Korean Language as a foundation.\\n\\nAccording to these materials, orthography includes △spelling △standard language △foreign words △romanization, etc.\\n\\nIn spelling problems, vocabulary exemplified in 'Korean Spelling Rules' and spacing problems have high frequency of appearance. Rather than simply memorizing, one must understand the principles to enable practical application for comprehensive defense. Knowing the principles means achieving victory in every battle. In 'Standard Language Regulations,' the standard language and standard pronunciation presented as examples are important. Here too, it's dangerous to only memorize examples. One must memorize the regulations themselves and study to enable application. Knowing the regulations accurately prevents losing points in this area. For foreign word transcription rules, it's good to learn vocabulary that's easy to get wrong based on basic principles. Since foreign words are also standard language (native words, Sino-Korean words, and foreign words are standard language), they are subject to standard language regulations. For 'Romanization Rules' revised in 2000, one must understand the basic principles and the notation forms that have changed from before. While foreign words and romanization may not have very high testing weight, it's advantageous to be familiar with basic matters.\\n\\nProblems about vocabulary semantic relationships and meaning usage are also tested. Particularly, ambiguous expressions and redundant expressions have high difficulty levels. Therefore, careful attention must be paid when studying these. When studying the Chinese character area, one easily feels like picking up a needle in a sand field, but at minimum, one should solve past problems from the Korean language area to make heaven want to help. Those who are completely unprepared cannot notice the signs even if heaven helps. One should study practical Chinese characters and even idioms to the extent of being able to appropriately apply them in context to avoid regret.\\n\\nFinally, regarding sentences, problems mainly about △sentence components △sentence structure △grammatical elements are tested. Since these are areas that easily cause confusion, thorough understanding is necessary before moving on. However, once understood, this is also an area where application skills are demonstrated. Correct sentences are an area with increasingly high testing weight in Korean language. Therefore, one must study perfectly to be able to apply language norms in practice for peace of mind. Problems are tested focusing on △correspondence relationships between sentence components △appropriate word choice △unnatural sentences, etc.\\n\\nVocabulary and grammar problems are ultimately an area closely related to actual language life. Today's test-takers find this difficult because they are weak in this area. After understanding major principles, one must practice using them correctly in daily life.

The schools without hagwon education that the ministry envisions are schools where students reduce their hagwon education by half within three years. The plan is to first select 400 schools this year, about 3.6% of all elementary, middle, and high schools nationwide, then expand to 600 schools in 2010, 800 in 2011, and 1,000 in 2012. The 400 schools that will begin operating from July this year will be selected by next month.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education will also announce 'Comprehensive Measures to Reduce Hagwon Education' on the 28th. Various policies are expected to be presented, including restrictions on hagwon late-night instruction, participation of education companies in after-school programs, improvements to school records [GPA], and reforms to special-purpose high school admissions.\\n\\nSchools designated as schools without hagwon education will receive an average of 150 million won [approximately $113,000 USD] annually for three years. The Ministry of Education stated that each school will use this money to strengthen regular classes, enhance after-school programs, expand educational facilities, and build the power of public education. This plan is nothing new. These are all things the Ministry of Education is already pursuing, with implementation plans and budgets already separately allocated for each item.\\n\\nThe key is still 'cutting hagwon education costs in half.' Yang Seong-gwang, Director of Human Resources Planning and Analysis, stated that day, \\\"The goal is to survey the hagwon education costs of students at relevant schools before starting the project, then reduce them by 20% after one year, 40% after two years, and 50% after three years.\\\" He added that student and parent satisfaction with school education should reach over 80% within three years. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced it would reduce hagwon education costs by up to 80% within three years. It's like a corporation setting cost reduction targets.\\n\\nHowever, accurately surveying students' hagwon education costs is virtually impossible. To prepare for this project, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education surveyed hagwon education costs at 21 elementary, middle, and high schools in Seoul early last month. They distributed survey forms to students and had them complete and submit them together with their parents. Realistically, such surveys are the only way education authorities can investigate hagwon education costs. The total monthly average hagwon education costs at 7 general high schools in Nowon, Seocho, Songpa, Yangcheon, and Yeongdeungpo districts was 826 million won [approximately $622,000 USD]. This averaged 658,000 won [approximately $496 USD] per person.\\n\\nEducation Policy Confusion... \\\"Worried Schools Might Become Hagwons\\\"\\n\\nAlthough these are areas with many hagwons and high levels of hagwon education spending, there was a significant difference from the 2008 Seoul area survey results announced by the Ministry of Education and Statistics Korea (375,000 won [approximately $283 USD] per person). Even comparing all elementary, middle, and high school students, the monthly hagwon education costs per person were nearly twice the Ministry of Education statistics (see page A12 of this paper's April 29 issue). There are also questions about whether the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's survey results, which distributed forms to parents and had them write down hagwon education costs, properly reflected the actual scale of hagwon education.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education cannot be unaware of these problems. Yet the fact that they hurriedly introduced the 'Schools Without Hagwon Education' and 'Cutting Hagwon Education in Half' projects shows how great the government's sense of compulsion is. The roots of this compulsion are various. The biggest seems to be that hagwon education costs actually increased in the first year of the Lee Myung-bak administration. The Lee Myung-bak government's education policy was 'doubling public education satisfaction, halving hagwon education,' but last year the monthly average hagwon education costs for English and math increased by 11.8% and 8.8% respectively compared to the previous year. The total scale of hagwon education costs also increased by 4.3%. There are also outcries from the field that the perceived level of hagwon education is rising daily. The education sector diagnoses that with President Lee having set a goal to be remembered as an 'education president,' the anxiety that it would become increasingly difficult if visible hagwon education reduction results aren't produced in the second year of his administration is combining with impatience to turn into compulsion.\\n\\nTogether with the recent restriction on hagwon late-night instruction that clearly revealed the confusion in education policy, schools without hagwon education show a cross-section of this administration's education philosophy. Rather than establishing principles for public education and trying to solve the 'causes' of problems, they are leaning toward symptomatic treatment that only tackles the hagwon education that appears as 'results.' As a result, education policy is veering off course with the discord between the ruling party, government, and Blue House overlapping between Presidential Committee on Future Planning Chairman Kwak Seung-jun's 'war plan' and the Ministry of Education's defensive prescriptions. A high school principal in Seoul said, \\\"Looking at the government's hagwon education measures, I'm worried that rather than schools absorbing hagwon education demand, schools might become hagwons altogether.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Kim Hee-gyun foryou@donga.com\\nGovernment Selects and Supports 400 Schools Without Hagwon Education\\n\\n▶ Popular Articles on Donga.com\\n- US Forces Korea Pilot Receives Medal After 6 Years for 'Crashing Away from Civilian Areas'\\n- \\\"I Couldn't Understand My Daughter's Suicide Attempt After Sending Her to Study Abroad...\\\"\\n- Foreign Cars Racing Through Central Pyongyang...Video Calls with 3G Mobile Phones Too\\n- Lee Byung-hun's Overseas Debut Film, Love Scene Partner is 'Director's Wife'...\\n- Female College Student 'Ten Pro' Appears on SBS Talk Show...\\\"Isn't That Too Much?\\\"\\n\\n▶ Popular Videos\\nReconnoitering Enemy Positions from 4km Altitude\\nCan You Play 'Go-Stop' in the New Equus?\\nProfessor Frankl Spreading the Ultimate Martial Art Jiu-Jitsu\\nWhat's at the Center of LG's Early Season Rise?\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4054, "output_tokens": 1668, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Then just knock on doors first\\\"\\nLast year, 27-year-old couple Lee Seong-jong (right) and Son Ji-hyun, who traveled through 10 African countries by bicycle for 6 months, are passing through an African village. In travels where they often had to rely on help from unfamiliar locals, Son's bright and outgoing personality was a great asset. Photo provided by Lee Seong-jong\\n《The 27-year-old couple Lee Seong-jong and Son Ji-hyun, who live in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, traveled Australia and New Zealand by bicycle from June 2007 to July 2008, and 10 African countries from March to October 2009. The distance they covered on two wheels amounts to roughly 10,500km. The couple, met on the 23rd, are preparing for another adventure this fall. Husband Lee, who is essentially half-unemployed, was wearing a brown winter jacket zipped up to his neck despite the warm spring weather of 15 degrees Celsius. Contrary to expectations, he even had a belly. Wife Son, dressed in overalls, had a youthful face with fair skin and a bright expression that wouldn't look out of place on a high school student. To think that this veteran traveler couple who had trekked through jungles teeming with wild animals and crossed deserts looked like people you'd commonly see at bus stops or subway stations. But when you heard their story, there was extraordinariness within the ordinariness.》\\nThe home of couple Lee Seong-jong (right) and Son Ji-hyun is located on remote farmland in Deokyang-gu, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, accessible only after traveling a long way down an unpaved road from the main street. Here, they are planning a life that combines adventure with livelihood. Goyang=Hong Jin-hwan, reporter\\n①Quick decision-making=They started dating at the end of 2004 and it took 222 days until marriage. They decided to marry after dating for just 3 months. At the time, Lee was on leave from his sophomore year in mechanical engineering at Chung-Ang University and doing alternative military service, while Son had just graduated from Korea University's College of Health Sciences and gotten a job as a nutritionist. \\\"What's the point of dragging it out?\\\" was their reason for the lightning-fast marriage.\\n②Flexibility=Both loved travel and planned a long-term trip. Originally they thought of a two-month Europe backpacking trip, but considering cost-effectiveness, bicycle travel caught their interest. That would require about 2 years of travel time. They prepared for a year with a route crossing China to Europe, collecting information and purchasing equipment. Their goal was to travel on $10 a day. While struggling to raise funds, just days before departure, they heard from a friend that Australia allows you to earn money while traveling, and like flipping a pancake, they changed their destination to Australia.\\n③Sociability=Son told the reporter in his 40s, \\\"32 years old? You're quite handsome.\\\" Son's amazing ability to easily approach any stranger. For the couple who lived in tents about 80% of the time during their travels, Son's personality was a great help. Locals gladly offered their front yards as camping spots to the smiling Son. Police stations and churches were no exception.\\n④Stubbornness=They planned to live an ordinary life after finishing their Australia and New Zealand trip. Lee highlighted his bicycle travel experience on job applications to major corporations but was repeatedly rejected. Son said, \\\"We were shocked that such an incredible experience didn't help at all with getting jobs.\\\" From then on, the two developed a stubbornness to succeed by combining travel with livelihood. Choosing dangerous Africa as their second travel destination was for this reason.\\n⑤Survival skills=Before the Australia trip, Lee worked at anything available—tutoring, hagwon instructor, construction labor—to save travel funds. He visited magazine companies out of the blue and secured promises to serialize travel stories, and after arriving in Cairns, Australia, for 3 months the couple worked cleaning hotel rooms during the day and as kitchen assistants and waitresses at restaurants at night to save money. They also contacted equipment companies and received sponsorship of expensive bicycles for their Africa trip.\\n⑥Optimism=Adventure is uncertainty. They willingly threw themselves into it. Son remembered the most heart-stopping moment of their travels as crossing the Mozambique border, dragging their bicycles for over 10 hours on sandy ground where robbers and lions frequently appeared. But they overcame the crisis thinking that once they got past this section, nothing in the world would be difficult. About a month ago, Lee started helping people who want to go on adventures by planning trips within their budgets and obtaining equipment for them. Income is still modest, but the couple smiled, saying \\\"things are getting better.\\\"\\nAdvice from this couple for people who want to go on long-term adventures but can't put it into practice: △If it's just a money problem, push through. New paths will open. △Build outstanding experience in your current job so you can make a comeback even with a gap in your career. △Outdoor activities are the trend. There are plenty of ways to turn adventure itself into profit. △The mental growth gained from adventure is incomparably valuable compared to several years of work experience.\\nKim Seong-gyu, reporter kimsk@donga.com\\n《 Hot News 》\\n☞ Hwang Jang-yop \\\"Why invest...

However, as we present the 'Dong-A Multicultural Award with LG' for the third year now, we can gradually sense that both the perception of multiculturalism and the hearts of immigrants are becoming brighter. This award was first established in 2010 by the Dong-A Ilbo and LG with support from the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. This year, △three multicultural families △two individuals contributing to multiculturalism △three organizations contributing to multiculturalism were selected. There were no recipients in the youth category. The judging panel consisted of Lee Bok-sil, Vice Minister of Gender Equality and Family; Ko Seon-ju, President of Korea Healthy Families Support Center; Yang Min-jeong, Director of the Multicultural Education Institute at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies; and Han Ki-heung, Deputy Editor of the Dong-A Ilbo Editorial Bureau.

Devoted all efforts to human rights movement to eliminate discrimination against migrant workers ▼\\n\\nReporter and PD for migrant broadcasting 'MWTV'. Activist for 'Burma National Action,' a Myanmar democratization movement group. Leader of migrant worker band 'Stop Crackdown.' Multicultural human rights instructor...\\nThese are the modifiers that describe So Mo-tu (38, photo). The 18-year journey he has lived since setting foot on Korean soil in 1995 is clearly revealed in this resume. He said he can feel Korea transforming into a multicultural society firsthand:\\n\\\"When I first came to Korea, people looked at me with curiosity wherever I went. Now they don't look at me as specially as before. This is proof that Korean society no longer feels awkward living alongside other ethnic groups.\\\"\\n\\nHe was once a person who had fallen out of favor with the Korean government. This was because he devoted himself to human rights movements, such as advocating for the elimination of discrimination against migrant workers. In 2009, the Ministry of Justice rejected his refugee application, stating that he 'was passive in democratization activities in Myanmar and would not be punished even if he returned.' He filed a lawsuit in court for 'cancellation of the refugee recognition denial decision' and lost in the first trial, but won in the second trial in November 2010. Recognized as a refugee, he said, \\\"There may be Koreans who dislike me. But I'm someone who has spent half my life in Korea. I think I can engage in human rights movements precisely because I truly love Korea.\\\"\\n\\nHe argued that multicultural policies that support only immigrants separately need to be revised. He emphasized, \\\"Immigrants get amusement park discount tickets just for being multicultural. But immigrants feel uncomfortable with this kind of special treatment. We should compete on equal terms with Koreans and decide support based on the same conditions. This is a truly multicultural society.\\\"\\nReporter Yu Geun-hyeong noel@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Individual Award Winner Isabel... As counselor, interpreter, 'big sister' to immigrant women ▼\\n\\n\\\"There were many women who said they were beaten by their husbands every day. I couldn't just listen.\\\"\\n'Filipina wife' Isabel (51, photo) was shocked by the lives of marriage immigrant women she first encountered when she came to Gwangju following her husband in 2000.\\n\\nStarting as an English hagwon instructor, she began helping immigrant women in earnest from 2002. She emptied her salary to support immigrant women who had fled violent husbands with living expenses and medical costs. Even now, she is not financially comfortable. However, emphasizing that 'service is a mission given to me,' she said clearly: \\\"I married late at 37. My role is to be the 'big sister' who can care for most of the young multicultural women.\\\"\\n\\nShe said that what immigrant women need most is 'counseling.' This is because she believes conflicts between immigrant women and their husbands arise from not understanding each other's cultural differences. Since 2004, she has been volunteering as a family counselor at 'Gwangju Women's Hotline.' She also worked as an interpreter for immigrant women who needed legal help due to family problems, drug addiction, and other issues.\\n\\nWith help from neighboring residents who heard about her activities, she opened the 'Immigrant Women's Community Room' at the Gwangju Buk-gu Youth Training Center in 2010. This created a cultural space where immigrant women could gather and help each other. Since last year, she has been running a 'Mother Country Language and Culture Classroom' for about 60 children from multicultural families, conducting a campaign to properly understand the language and culture of their mothers' countries. She requested, \\\"Our society must sincerely accept the reality of multiculturalism and not spare more consistent interest and support.\\\"\\nReporter Lee Cheol-ho irontiger@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Family Award Winner Park Ji-young...

Iksan=Reporter Park Yeong-cheol skyblue@donga.com\\n\\nHer Korean in-laws' circumstances were no better than her Vietnamese family's.\\n\\nHer husband Lim Won-jun (52), who was 20 years older and whom she married just three days after being introduced through a marriage agency in October 2005, was a disabled person (physical grade 3) who could not use his left hand after receiving multiple brain surgeries due to construction site fall accidents in his youth. Right after marriage, her husband raised pigs but went bankrupt due to foot-and-mouth disease and could not earn living expenses. Taking care of her in-laws who suffered from old age ailments and stroke was already back-breaking work, but interest notices for the agricultural cooperative debt her father-in-law had incurred kept arriving every month.\\n\\nPark Ji-young (Vietnamese name: Do Thi Hong Han, 32) has been supporting her entire family alone since marrying into Onsu-ri, Wanggung-myeon, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do, just as she did in Vietnam. Although she married without knowing her husband was disabled, she did not express dissatisfaction. Since coming to Korea, she worked as a cleaner at a hospital near home while also collecting and selling cardboard boxes. After work, she would go to the hospital where her father-in-law was admitted to care for him. When she came home, she never forgot to massage her stroke-afflicted mother-in-law and keep her company.\\n\\nHer Vietnamese family also awaits her care. She tries to send even small amounts of money to her young siblings back home, wringing out a dry towel, but it's not easy. She also wants to bring her stroke-afflicted mother back home to Korea for treatment.\\n\\nEveryone in the village and at work praises her, saying 'a lucky charm has rolled in.' Her father-in-law, whom she cared for for 8 years, passed away a month ago, and her mother-in-law is now staying at her sister-in-law's house, so things are somewhat easier these days. She now works as a hospital kitchen assistant and her income has improved.\\n\\nFortunately, her first-grade daughter Seon-ah (7) is growing up smart and pretty, giving her great expectations. Her dream is to learn beauty work in the future. Her modest hope is to earn money stably and comfortably through beauty work, living peacefully with her husband and daughter while helping her family back home.\\nIksan=Reporter Kim Gwang-o kokim@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Family Award Winner Joya Judy... Working as native speaker instructor while dreaming of becoming nursing assistant ▼\\n\\nJoya Judy (right), who came from the Philippines as a bride, is out for a rare outing with her husband Park Yong-i and two daughters near their home. Provided by Tongyeong Multicultural Family Support Center\\n\\n\\\"Mother, hagwon! I'm going to hagwon.\\\"\\n\\nJoya Judy (39), who lives in a cozy farmhouse on Cheokpo-gil, Sanyang-eup, Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, with a view of the deep blue sea, politely greets her mother-in-law Yu Sun-deok (70) as she 'goes to school' to a nursing hagwon downtown around 9 AM. She also encourages her husband Park Yong-i (44) with somewhat awkward Korean, saying \\\"Take care and work well.\\\" Her husband works at a nearby octopus farm.\\n\\nShe married Park through an acquaintance's introduction in 2005 and began her life in Korea. She has been attending nursing hagwon since March this year to achieve her dream of becoming a nursing assistant. The certification exam is in March next year. She takes classes 5 hours a day, 5 days a week. Kang Seok-beom, deputy director of this hagwon, said, \\\"She's always positive and studies hard,\\\" and \\\"With multicultural families increasing, if she gets a job at a hospital, she'll have many advantages in interpretation and other areas.\\\"\\n\\nOn Tuesdays and Fridays, she rushes to the Tongyeong Multicultural Family Support Center as soon as hagwon ends. She teaches English to elementary school students in after-school programs. She teaches 4 hours a week and receives 480,000 won [approximately $360 USD] per month. For several years after marriage, she also worked at a seafood processing plant.\\n\\nShe majored in mathematics at a university in the Philippines and says, \\\"My husband's income is small, so I need to get a job at a hospital and earn money to raise the children well.\\\" The couple has two daughters: Da-bin (8), a second-grader, and Da-eun (5). The second daughter has disabilities, with delayed physical development and communication difficulties. An unmarried brother-in-law (34) also lives with them.\\n\\nOk Hae-suk, team leader at Tongyeong Multicultural Family Support Center, and Choi Gyeong-hui, visiting teacher, said, \\\"Judy is remarkably kind and has exceptional life skills,\\\" and \\\"She plays three roles - caring for family, attending hagwon, and working as a native speaker instructor - yet never loses her smile.\\\"\\nTongyeong=Reporter Kang Jeong-hun manman@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Family Award Winner Cho Man-suk... Village head who led road paving and shelter remodeling ▼\\n\\nCheon Bong-man and Cho Man-suk recently showed their affectionate side at a multicultural family event in Seoul. Cho says, \\\"My husband is my most reliable supporter.\\\" Provided by Cho Man-suk\\n\\n\\\"I opened my heart and approached them first. When I didn't know something, I asked thousands of times.\\\"\\n\\nCho Man-suk (46), who is from China, starts her day by visiting village elders to check on their well-being. She prefers being called the 'eldest daughter-in-law.' She said, \\\"When the elders compliment me saying I'm admirable, I feel really proud.\\\"\\n\\nShe is the village head of Seokgye-ri, Gogyeong-myeon, Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do. About 50 households and 130 residents live there. The residents, over 80% of whom are over 65, observed her character and sincerity and elected her as village head in August 2010. Although there was some opposition saying 'How can a foreigner, and a woman at that, be village head,' the elders did not bend their will.\\n\\nShe accomplished the long-cherished wish of paving the village farm road and remodeling the pavilion, which serves as a rest area. Recently, she also set up a yoga classroom at the senior center. These are the fruits of diligently visiting relevant government offices to file complaints and persuade officials.\\n\\nIn 1995, when she was working as a kindergarten teacher in Shenyang, China, she met her husband Cheon Bong-man (53) and fell in love at first sight, marrying him. She dreamed of a glamorous life, but difficult family circumstances and cultural differences made her consider giving up several times.\\n\\nHowever, she did not give up hope. Instead of her husband, whose health was poor, she took full charge of farming to make a living. She worked at restaurants and auto parts factories so her daughter Seol-bin (17) and son Seong-pyo (15) could receive good education. Though it was difficult, she also attended university and obtained certificates as a social worker, childcare teacher, and psychological counselor. Thanks to this, she was appointed as a visiting instructor for multicultural families at Yeongcheon Multicultural Family Support Center in 2008, and as a Gyeongsangbuk-do multicultural ambassador in March this year.\\n\\nCho said, \\\"Whenever things got tough, I would tell myself, 'I came to live in Korea. I didn't come chasing dreams.' By working hard like that, people around me recognized me.\\\"\\nYeongcheon=Reporter Jang Yeong-hun jang@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Creating a society of togetherness... You are our hope ▼\\n\\nOrganization Award Saenggaknamu BB Center... Created bilingual textbooks to help children's learning\\n\\nA marriage immigrant woman who is a member of Saenggaknamu BB Center is teaching children about her home country's culture. Members have been consistently teaching their children the language and culture of their mothers' countries. Provided by Saenggaknamu BB Center\\n\\n\\\"I think what's important for immigrant women living in Korea is building their own strength and demonstrating their talents. Only then can they be role models for their children.\\\"\\n\\nAn Soon-hwa (48, female), representative of the immigrant women's self-help group 'Saenggaknamu BB Center,' said she established the center based on this thinking. The center, which opened in October 2009, has about 800 online members and 280 offline members. Immigrant women from about 20 countries have joined. The center's name was chosen to mean that the thoughts of immigrant mothers and their children should grow strong like trees. BB stands for Bilingual and Bicultural.\\n\\nIn 2011, members developed a bilingual textbook called 'We Are One.' Their children would take this textbook to school and proudly show it to friends and teachers. Children who once felt ashamed of their mothers who were not fluent in Korean began feeling pride seeing their mothers who were fluent in their native languages.\\n\\nHelping immigrant women in difficulty is also their responsibility. In January 2011, they collected money to give blankets to immigrant women experiencing financial hardship. So they could have a warm winter. One immigrant woman expressed gratitude, saying, \\\"I've lived in Korea for 8 years, but this is the first time I'm covering myself with a new blanket.\\\"\\n\\nLast year, members visited China and introduced Korean language and culture to local children. They proudly promoted Korea, their second homeland, effectively serving as civilian diplomats.\\n\\nMembers have not forgotten their initial pledge when establishing the center to live as proud women who contribute to Korean society. Some members demonstrate their talents as National Assembly staff secretaries, bilingual instructors, and cultural foundation directors. Their dream is for more such immigrant women to emerge.\\nReporter Lee Sam-mul evey@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Organization Award KAIST... Operating convergence talent program for customized science education ▼\\n\\nKAIST operates a convergence talent program for multicultural students with aptitude in science. A KAIST student mentor is providing online education to an elementary school student. Provided by KAIST Convergence Education Research Center\\n\\n\\\"I was originally interested in science but had no clear goal. While attending the multicultural school, I was able to discover my talent in robotics.\\\"\\n\\nThese are the words of Hong Yevgeny (15), who entered Seoul Robot High School this year. Because his mother is Russian, he had the opportunity to attend the 'LG Love Multicultural School' operated by KAIST. Here he discovered his interests and entered the nation's only maister high school [specialized vocational high school] for robotics and mechanical control. He has already decided on a plan to study mobile robotics in the future.\\n\\nThe Convergence Education Research Center under KAIST's Natural Science Research Institute, which helped him, has been operating the Love Multicultural School convergence talent program with LG since 2010. Last year, a total of 67 elementary, middle, and high school students participated. Thirty students visit KAIST directly once a month to attend classes. They conduct experimental classes divided by elementary, middle, and high school levels.\\n\\nEleven KAIST mentors helped with hands-on classes where students directly set up volcanic eruption experiments or created desert oases, water rockets, and gene chips.\\n\\nThirty elementary school students who had difficulty coming to KAIST directly received online education. Tablet PCs were provided to all, and materials for experiments were sent in 'science boxes.' The center has consistently had students participate in science expos since 2010. Interest is high because of the experiential education. Last year, the attendance rate for second-term students was 94% offline and 89% online.\\n\\nThe convergence talent program is characterized not by simply supporting students, but by developing their aptitude in science and engineering fields in a customized manner. Of the 18 students who entered high school through this program, 9 achieved the success of entering special purpose schools including Changwon Science High School or autonomous private high schools.\\nReporter Kim Do-hyeong dodo@donga.com\\n\\n▼ Organization Award Jeollanam-do... Internet fee support and online Korean cooking classes ▼\\n\\nMulticultural families are learning how to make Korean food. Jeollanam-do serves as a supporter of multicultural families by providing themed Korean cooking recipes online. Provided by Jeollanam-do\\n\\nAs of December last year, there were 9,768 marriage immigrant women and about 10,000 children in the Jeollanam-do region. With the significant increase in international marriages, Jeollanam-do established a multicultural policy division within the Women and Family Department in June last year. Twenty multicultural family support centers are effectively serving as 'information exchange venues' for immigrant women and multicultural families. Last year, they spent 5.5 billion won [approximately $4.1 million USD] to operate Korean language education, family integration education, and employment-linked education programs.\\n\\nThe internet fee support project, which reduces communication costs for multicultural families, has been well-received, with a budget of about 450 million won [approximately $340,000 USD] allocated for six consecutive years. It supports 70% of internet usage fees for families that immigrated within 7 years. The online course (jn.damunwha.com) to help understand food culture, one of the conflict factors in multicultural families, introduces themed Korean cooking recipes in 6 languages.\\n\\nTwenty-three language instructors deployed to cities and counties evaluate the language skills of multicultural family children, provide language education appropriate to their level, and operate language gifted classrooms. They also created and distributed 1,000 copies of parent education materials containing information on daycare center usage and childcare techniques in English, Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese. The 'Mother (Father) Country Language Contest' that started in 2011 serves as a catalyst to strengthen family bonds in multicultural families.\\n\\nTraining immigrant women to work as translation and interpretation specialists at multicultural family support centers is also one of the main projects. In December last year, 16 immigrant women who received translation and interpretation capacity-building education passed the Test of Proficiency in Korean (levels 3 and 4).\\n\\nJeollanam-do Governor Park Jun-yeong pledged, \\\"Multicultural families have already become one of the common family forms in our rural areas. We will implement various policies so that multicultural families in our region can build happy families while nurturing dreams and hopes.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9820, "output_tokens": 4964, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
