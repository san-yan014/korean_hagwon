Please introduce yourselves.\\nGold Spoon IV Mom (hereafter IV Mom): Hello, I'm Gold Spoon IV Mom.\\nSuper Stamina Mom (hereafter Stamina Mom): Hello, I'm Super Stamina Mom.\\nHyochang-dong Good Wife and Mother (hereafter Good Wife): Hello, I'm Hyochang-dong Good Wife and Mother, back again.\\nNakseong-daei Alice (hereafter Alice): Hello, I'm Nakseong-daei Alice.\\nPyeongchon Easy Mom (hereafter Easy Mom): Hello, I'm Pyeongchon Easy Mom.\\nChae In-taek: Yes. You're all such vibrant people whenever I see you. Today, you vibrant people need to be not just vibrant but truly sharp and go beyond vibrant to really speak boldly about this topic. It's about career-interrupted women. We'll do this under the title 'Career-Interrupted Women's Resumes.' Looking at the situation now, many people have career interruptions due to childcare more than other reasons - because of childbirth and childcare. Because of this, they're seeking new lives or giving up their careers until then, and various things are happening. That's why the government creates employment support systems for career-interrupted women, and the appeals of career-interrupted women often appear in newspapers and broadcasts. What are the careers of today's participants like? Let me hear how secure your careers are.\\nEasy Mom: I'm Pyeongchon Easy Mom. In my case, I got married at thirty-two, but I think I made the choice of whether to marry or not in my mid-twenties. So my case isn't one of complete career interruption but career reduction, and I voluntarily chose to reduce it. I graduated from university and entered a major corporation where I worked from early morning to evening, until night.\\nChae In-taek: Not 9-to-5 but 5-to-11 or something like that?\\nEasy Mom: Yes, something similar. While living like that, I thought, 'Living this way, can I get married? Can I have children?' When I thought about it, I had to make a choice. After working for about 1-2 years, I thought, 'Ah, this kind of life isn't the life I want,' and 'Since I'm someone who will get married someday, I can't continue like this.' So I voluntarily quit and took the path of studies.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, the reason you quit was that in that kind of lifestyle, it would be difficult to get married, have children, and live the life you wanted?\\nEasy Mom: Yes, impossible.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, even impossible?\\nEasy Mom: I think it's impossible. And at that time, it was the first atmosphere where they were hiring many female college graduates in large numbers. In that atmosphere, I absolutely couldn't slack off at the company or take it easy. Also, because of my school background, the company's expectations of me were very high. So after much consideration, I left that way. While trying to keep my career alive, not to interrupt it, I'm living with continuous efforts, really tearful efforts.\\nChae In-taek: You mean a new career? You newly entered graduate school, got married, had a baby, and are building a career while balancing studies and childcare. You're currently a part-time instructor, right?\\nEasy Mom: Yes.\\nGood Wife: But last time you said you decided on your major at 15, and this time in your mid-twenties you're looking ahead ten years again... Your foresight is amazing. I'm really, why is this so annoying? Something's annoying about it (haha).\\nChae In-taek: You're saying you want to live life in a planned way, but even when you live with plans, such huge obstacles always appear outside your plans.\\nEasy Mom: I want to live easily.\\nGood Wife: The destination is similar.\\nEasy Mom: I plan to live easily, but it turns out to be the same thing.\\nChae In-taek: You planned to live easily, but the conclusion is living very hard. Die hard.\\nGood Wife: You say 'easy' but whether it's really easy is... (I don't know).\\nAlice: Compared to Easy Mom, I lived really normally, not strangely at all. I graduated from undergraduate school and just like ordinary people, I was lucky enough to enter a major corporation at that time. I entered the corporation and after seeing how the senior colleagues lived, I felt a lot of doubt. They recommended I quit, but when I didn't quit, after seeing them put my desk in front of the tea room, after experiencing that, I quit and thought, 'Ah, studying is my path. As expected,' so I did my master's. When I did my master's, I thought, 'Ah, to study in Korea, you need money,' so I needed that money and to continue studying, I entered a public institution and worked there. Then I passed the doctoral program, but according to graduate school regulations, I had to be a full-time student, so I quit the public institution and started my doctorate.\\nGood Wife: What a waste.\\nEasy Mom: That good public institution (you quit).\\nChae In-taek: You quit that good public institution job and entered the path of academia?\\nAlice: Yes. Just like an ordinary person, going to school and studying.\\nChae In-taek: Well, it doesn't seem like ordinary people. What kind of values were at work in between?\\nAlice: It was really ordinary values. I really wanted to maintain eating, living, and my studies as a profession.\\nChae In-taek: You wanted to study? You thought it would be good if studying were your profession?\\nAlice: Because the public institution, unlike general corporations or other companies, would send you to evening graduate school or let you use vacation more easily, although not like civil servants, the atmosphere was such that you could use vacation more easily, so I entered the public institution. So I thought I could do my doctorate that way too, but I learned about the school regulations too late and had to quit.\\nChae In-taek: Seoul National University made a regulation a few years ago that for the first two semesters after doctoral admission, you must attend full-time, right?\\nAlice: Yes. It seems to have been made so you can focus on studies.\\nChae In-taek: It has pros and cons, but for our Alice Mom, it could be a damaging occasion.\\nAlice: Yes. So actually after admission, I took a leave of absence for a year. I also felt the burden of possibly taking away someone else's opportunity (but I had no choice).\\nChae In-taek: You took a leave and continued at the public company.\\nAlice: Yes. I needed to save some money. So I saved money and worked until (before quitting). I really worked continuously without rest. I got pregnant at 35 and gave birth at 36. Until then, I also normally came to graduate school, did projects, and studied. I had really been building my career normally like that, but after getting pregnant, I wasn't particularly overworking myself, I was doing projects and research like ordinary graduate students, but what I hadn't taken care of before was my body, and generally using public transportation. From Seoul to the workplace is a round trip of 2 hours. It's not special for me, it's generally like that. Graduate students are the same, but we usually finish work around 11-12 PM. When there's work to do.\\nChae In-taek: Oh, attending graduate school and doing projects, the time you finish and leave is 11 PM?\\nAlice: That's right. Yes, it's not just me (many people are like that).\\nChae In-taek: Not AM? PM 12, 11. Ah yes.\\nAlice: I think fatigue accumulated. So in the middle of pregnancy, at 20 weeks, about halfway, there was so much bleeding that I had to stop all work and come home. And after giving birth.\\nEasy Mom: That's when involuntary career interruption began.\\nChae In-taek: When you started studying, quitting your previous job was a voluntary choice, but as you were adapting to that life of studying and doing projects, you got pregnant, but at 20 weeks due to bleeding and fatigue, you couldn't bear it anymore, so you involuntarily had to stop graduate school projects and only take care of your health?\\nAlice: Yes. Probably not just me, but anyone who attended graduate school in Korea... because graduate school isn't like a job where someone looks after you and decides where you go, it's not absolute but something you do yourself, so (everyone would be similar).\\nChae In-taek: Everyone outside thinks how rewarding, comfortable, and enjoyable a life of studying must be. But inside the cage, there are tremendous transactions and problems, and especially having and raising a baby while living graduate school life - the problems are as big and difficult as having a job?\\nEasy Mom: Maybe even bigger (than a job).\\nAlice: More than a job. Because people too easily say, 'You're studying, so you don't have to (study, work) for a while, right?'\\nChae In-taek: Ah, if you have a job, they say 'Work must be hard, so rest and take care of the baby,' but if you're studying, they demand why you can't do it. Ah, this will be an important point.\\nIV Mom: Yes. And you can't even make money (while doing it).\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you can't even make money while... Ah, social perception.\\nGood Wife: In Korea, people really devalue those who can't take care of themselves (IV Mom: while spending money) and can't earn their keep.\\nChae In-taek: Because you earn money, 'How hard you must work to earn money.'\\nIV Mom: 'You spend money, so why are you like that?'\\nChae In-taek: 'You study and spend money, what's so hard about that?'\\nGood Wife: 'Are you showing off?'\\nChae In-taek: Alice Mom, you've experienced both working and the life of studying and doing projects in graduate school. Honestly, there are various cases so horizontal comparison wouldn't work, but based on your experience, what comparison could be made between the two?\\nAlice: Um, whether you gain physical freedom or mental freedom, spiritual freedom.\\nChae In-taek: Spiritual freedom and physical freedom.\\nAlice: That's what I felt. When working, you have no soul but rather that schedule, especially since my last job was at a public institution. If you move according to that schedule, your mind really doesn't have to focus on that work, which is a characteristic of bureaucracy. It doesn't collapse greatly if one person is missing. It becomes like that, but because you can't do anything according to your will, there's a resulting, how should I say, helplessness? That came to me. Many people don't feel this, but I felt helplessness. So I started studying, but after studying, I feel helpless about the economic situation. Because at the last public institution I worked at, my net income was over 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] annually. Net income was (that much) because I had some seniority. But after entering the doctoral program, the maximum pre-tax amount, not net income but pre-tax amount, that you can receive by doing the most projects in the doctoral program is 2.5 million won [approximately $1,900 USD].\\nEasy Mom: If you received that much from the school, you did a tremendous amount of work.\\nChae In-taek: Pre-tax 3000 [million won]. Working until eleven.\\nAlice: I was a legend. I was the legend who received 2.5 million won [approximately $1,900 USD], but doing that, per month.\\nChae In-taek: To become a legend, you have to work until midnight?\\nAlice: Work until midnight, pull all-nighters three or four times a month, and no weekends.\\nChae In-taek: No weekends either?\\nAlice: Yes, that's right.\\nChae In-taek: As a student?\\nEasy Mom: Oh no, not a student.\\nAlice: And when reports pile up at year-end, you should think you can't go home for about a week then.\\nChae In-taek: What about the baby?\\nAlice: That was before pregnancy.\\nChae In-taek: When you were doing projects before pregnancy?\\nAlice: Probably people who have children now and work at school (graduate students) really leave their children only at home and only do school work. That's what they have no choice but to do in Korea (that's the reality for graduate students).\\nChae In-taek: Just like people who work, they have no choice but to leave children completely at daycare centers or maternal family or, though difficult, paternal grandparents, and come to school to do projects like going to work.\\nEasy Mom: Otherwise, you can't proceed with studies. For classes, many graduate school classes are offered in the evening.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, evening classes are quite helpful for part-time students, but for full-time students, especially student mothers balancing childcare, it can be a very difficult situation.\\nEasy Mom: And there are very many cases of having lab meetings on Saturdays or workshops on weekends.\\nChae In-taek: Laboratory, research lab meetings are rather more common on weekends. Why weekends? Because of professors' schedules?\\nEasy Mom: During weekdays there are lectures and other classes (so).\\nChae In-taek: Because everyone's busy?\\nEasy Mom: It's also difficult to gather.\\nGood Wife: My husband did his doctorate in science and engineering, and lab meetings were Saturday mornings. So I asked, 'Why Saturday morning lab meetings?' and he said, 'The advisor professor feels good seeing students research on Saturday mornings. He also did that during his doctorate, so he calls them on Saturdays too to study hard.'\\nEasy Mom: Saturday morning is common.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, this isn't something just one or two of you experienced. You're saying it's not a special case but a universal situation.\\nAlice: It's a universal situation. And now students also become dual-career couples, but when I put my child on the daycare waiting list, we weren't dual-career yet. So with no place to rely on, either maternal or paternal families, I put my child on the waiting list for national and public daycare centers. Even when I used loopholes and registered as dual-career, it was still so long. My husband and I went directly to see private or home daycare centers. The situation. Then this person, who wouldn't even take care of (the child) himself, said, 'I feel so uncomfortable leaving the child at such a place.' So when there's no place to leave the child and he says he feels so uncomfortable...\\nEasy Mom: Give up your career.\\nAlice: If we're not getting divorced, I can't send the child where I want.\\nChae In-taek: My goodness, between spouses, crack or friction that could cause... it didn't cause problems, did it?\\nAlice: No. So that didn't work either. For a babysitter, the house we live in actually has much more debt than assets, but this gets counted as assets.\\nGood Wife: Are you house poor?\\nAlice: It's a long story, but because it gets counted as assets, we don't qualify for government support. We'd have to pay for a babysitter mostly out of our own pocket.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, if it's counted as assets, it doesn't matter whether you borrowed money, inherited it, or originally had it. It depends on the asset size itself.\\nAlice: Yes. So in a situation where our home loan payments alone make living expenses tight, as you can see from my appearance, I barely applied lotion before coming out.\\nChae In-taek: It's a podcast so we can't see.\\nGood Wife: That's why you appeared on this?\\nAlice: Yes, that's why I came out confidently.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you can't appear on video?\\nGood Wife: There are some people like that here too.\\nChae In-taek: You're being too modest.\\nAlice: Yes. So I had no choice but to come home in September 2013, gave birth in March 2014, and finally my child enters daycare this March, in March 2016. For 2 years and 6 months (as a full-time housewife).\\nChae In-taek: So for 2 years and 6 months, you were a full-time housewife at home after childbirth?\\nAlice: That's right.\\nEasy Mom: Involuntarily (career interrupted).\\nChae In-taek: Until the child could go to daycare, for 2 years and 6 months, there was voluntary job interruption, but also interruption of academic and research career from graduate school.\\nAlice: That's right. The professor contacted me until last spring, but now hasn't contacted me for a year. But I'm in a position where I have to show the professor again that I'm prepared to this extent, so it's a frustrating situation.\\nStamina Mom: You probably can't even think about a second child.\\nAlice: I think I should have a second child after receiving my doctorate.\\nGood Wife: Then you'd be an advanced maternal age, elderly primigravida.\\nChae In-taek: I have nothing to say.\\nEasy Mom: Actually, though I briefly mentioned earlier, when I think about the situation then, thinking about preventing my career from being interrupted, tears really blur my vision. Because I was an instructor, if I had a child during the semester, I would lose my teaching, that is, my instructor job. So I had planned pregnancy at the hospital to match the dates.\\nChae In-taek: To give birth during vacation?\\nEasy Mom: Yes. So there's only one chance every 6 months. (Oh my, what to do.) So I got pregnant that way, gave birth just one week after vacation started, and returned to teaching after just 45 days. Really, ah, thinking about that time, tears really blur my vision.\\nChae In-taek: This is shocking work that requires studying various fields like biology, physiology, and embryology. Good Wife, how is your career then, and how are you maintaining it now?\\nGood Wife: I keep hearing 'Good Wife.'\\nChae In-taek: The term 'Good Wife' itself isn't about career interruption but career abandonment, isn't it? That's not the case for you, right? You have the will? The will to continue and maintain your career?\\nGood Wife: I have the will. I have the will, but to be a good wife, of course, I'm worried I might really become a good wife these days. I keep hearing 'good wife' lately. But what should I say... I also worked at a public institution. From after having my first child until before getting pregnant with my second child.\\nEasy Mom: Ah, why are all these accomplished people like this?\\nChae In-taek: You should be going to work now, but you're doing Mom's Talk.\\nGood Wife: But you can't do all of this together. You have to earn money, live, raise children, and study. My graduate school grades were all B-minuses, and I was taking out student loans to attend graduate school, but when salary comes in from work, it all goes to living expenses and doesn't accumulate. You end up spending as much as you earn. Why are there so many ceremonial occasions? So I quit work and decided 'I'll rather devote myself to studying,' but I couldn't even get into research projects. Because there are young students who can use their time anytime and can be mobilized, young students get into research projects, not someone like me with children. Even when I applied, I wouldn't get selected.\\nChae In-taek: The internal logic is 'Young people need opportunities because they're economically struggling, and older people might have worked other jobs and saved money,' is that how they see it?\\nGood Wife: I think it would be easy to think that way.\\nChae In-taek: Is that true?\\nAlice: Especially for married women, there's someone, the husband, who works and earns money, so 'At any rate, doesn't one person earn?' This also exists.\\nChae In-taek: One person in the family earns, so it would be good if you yielded a little. Something like that?\\nGood Wife: Yes. But actually, our career - if there are several years of gaps on a resume, there's no way to fill them. So I chose a kind of startup. Actually, it's not starting a business enterprise or company, but I started organizing a civil society group. Since my major is social welfare, seeing that the learning rights, human rights, or maternal rights of mother graduate students are in such blind spots of the system, I started making a group and organizing to propose policies about these problems.\\nEasy Mom: But you worked but didn't receive money or belong anywhere, right?\\nGood Wife: No monthly salary at all. If I did research projects or something, I donated all my labor costs to Mom in SNU, so I didn't receive salary for the past 4 years. So my husband said just one thing: 'It's good that you go out and work, but please earn some money.'\\nChae In-taek: Really a desperate double or triple burden...\\nGood Wife: So in the power relationship with my husband, the advantage I gained by producing two sons was all lost by not earning money and living off my husband. So while I barely maintained the lifeline, the career on my resume through volunteering.\\nChae In-taek: You maintained (career) on your resume through volunteering?\\nGood Wife: Organizing groups and acting as representative, contributing to women's civil society and student parent human rights, legislative proposals and policy proposals through this, writing research reports, writing policy proposals, requesting legislation. So actually last February, the Parent Student Act passed in the 19th National Assembly. So as Alice Mom mentioned, parent students moved up in daycare waiting priority. They're recognized as dual-career. I did such activities, but life was really at the basic livelihood recipient level.\\nChae In-taek: You said 'I kept my career alive through volunteering,' but from a third party's perspective, and especially from your husband's perspective, since cash supply capacity is almost zero, some people might see this as (doing nothing). Your husband might especially strongly think that no career was extended?\\nGood Wife: It's not just thinking - he says it out loud. Seoul National University master's graduate living off meals.\\nChae In-taek: You should prepare boxing gloves or massage equipment at home. Ah, you should prepare that thing you put in your ears?\\nGood Wife: Earplugs?\\nChae In-taek: Earplugs so you can pretend not to know even if you shout at each other.\\nEasy Mom: Ah, it's earplugs.\\nGood Wife: Earplugs. You understand perfectly even when I speak unclearly. I gave birth to two sons.\\nEasy Mom: But please know that much.\\nChae In-taek: Never letting it slide (that's Easy Mom).\\nGood Wife: After two C-sections, my brain became like this.\\nChae In-taek: What was the situation before doing this?\\nGood Wife: Elegant and intelligent.\\nChae In-taek: You have very clear excuses, but the passage of time comes to us too, regardless of C-sections. So what story does our Stamina Mom have?\\nStamina Mom: I was attending undergraduate school and preparing to try different studies. But in my early twenties, I chose to get married. So I thought, 'I'll get married and then study,' and got married in my early twenties. I'll be really struggling until about 40, but I prepared myself and calculated time and got married. But actually, I had no plans for children. I was really the opposite of Easy Mom - I really couldn't plan. Since I was little, everyone knew I wouldn't get married and I openly said this from a very young age, but I got married in my early twenties and had two children in a row.\\nIV Mom: People like that originally go early.\\nStamina Mom: Yes. So my high school teacher even came. To the wedding.\\nEasy Mom: I quit work to get married but got married after thirty.\\nIV Mom: That's how it usually is.\\nStamina Mom: So I became a mother in my early twenties. To do new studies, I would have had to enter university again. I was watching for the right time, but that was my thinking - other people were like, 'You got married and had children, haven't you achieved everything?' That was basically the attitude. But that wasn't the case for me, so I tried to study. When I tried to do the studies I wanted, many people said, 'It would be good to study at a lifelong education center.' I'm not trying to disparage that - there are many really good educational institutions. I actually looked into it. But the field I wanted to study required more education. So I decided, 'Let's take CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] again,' and started preparing for entrance exams after our second child passed 15 months, starting to turn two.\\nEasy Mom: How old were you then?\\nStamina Mom: I was twenty-seven or twenty-eight. So from then on (I prepared), but what I wanted to study wasn't just studying - I had to do practical skills. So I took CSAT through internet lectures and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] is free. And I did practical skills day and night, took CSAT, took the test again and entered university again. But I heard there are such cases abroad (of late admission). Many, and there are even universities you can go to when you're older. But in Korea (there aren't). I have no support or anything, and everyone around opposed it, so only my husband and I thought about this and did it. We broke all our savings and children's insurance to study. But if I failed, I'd be nothing - it was complete gambling. But I did it! I studied and was really lucky, really thankfully got admitted. But after admission, I rested for 3 years because my child was sick. I had to take care of the child's illness. But it's a problem that depends entirely on me. Other people don't think it's important when you're studying, and don't even think of it as career interruption.\\nEasy Mom: And at that time, there was no childcare leave for child illness, so it must have been really difficult.\\nStamina Mom: And my position is as an undergraduate. It's not a general situation at all. Graduate students or doctoral students usually do that, but an undergraduate getting married and doing this - most cases like this are when young people made mistakes unintentionally. And it interferes with studies themselves. But anyway, those are external difficulties. From my personal standpoint, I'm breaking through that and continuing to finish my studies and create my career while studying.\\nGood Wife: So this seems like you're a career frontier who tremendously overcame personal and social limitations.\\nStamina Mom: That sounds nice (haha).\\nGood Wife: In Korea, becoming like this - this is almost a legendary figure. But when I went to UC Berkeley and visited the parent student center, there were many undergraduate parent students there. So I was talking with the center director, and there are many people who transfer from community colleges to UC Berkeley, or people who were in the military and come back to state universities after discharge, so there are many people who are parents. It's a good school. But there are second chances, second opportunities like this. It's not that if you fail college entrance once, you live as a life loser, but there are opportunities and systems where you can continuously challenge throughout your life cycle, but in Korea that's very limited, especially coming back to prestigious universities - there are almost no institutional (ways).\\nEasy Mom: Almost none, we should say.\\nStamina Mom: So cases like mine seem very rare at school. Coming in after having two children. So positioning is unclear for me and for the school too - it's somewhat ambiguous.\\nGood Wife: I was like that too. Coming through independent study degree [a Korean system for earning degrees through self-study and examinations], it was ambiguous.\\nChae In-taek: I see. So, self-proclaimed Gold Spoon IV Mom, is your career interruption voluntary, involuntary, due to childbirth and childcare, or a choice for your own upgrade? Let me hear.\\nIV Mom: I don't know how to classify it either. I also got married quite early. I got married in my senior year of college and was preparing for employment thinking 'I should get a job after marriage,' but I was pregnant. Then with a big belly, I can't do interviews or training. I'm a pregnant woman. Suddenly I went from being a job seeker to a pregnant woman. So I thought, 'Then I should postpone employment for a while' and gave birth.\\nChae In-taek: Being pregnant became a kind of status? A personal condition that indicates social position. So you can't even interview, and even if you apply, they ask 'Why did you come in this condition?' Ah, we don't think about that much. We think workplaces are where unmarried, non-pregnant men and women apply, but there are actually many cases like this?\\nIV Mom: Pregnant women coming to interviews - they can't understand it.\\nChae In-taek: You never tried?\\nIV Mom: So I tried, but pushing myself caused problems with the child's health, and also...\\nEasy Mom: It's worrying even if you succeed.\\nIV Mom: Even if successful, suddenly entering and receiving training, then saying I have to go give birth.\\nEasy Mom: And training involves a lot of physical training and such.\\nIV Mom: You can't run with a big belly.\\nGood Wife: You run during training?\\nAlice, Easy Mom: Team activities like tower building. And overnight mountain climbing for 1 night 2 days, things like that.\\nIV Mom: Calculating, it didn't work out ambiguously. So I thought I should give birth quickly and get employed quickly. So I gave birth and tried, but (about pregnancy) I had no plans.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, to get employed quickly, you gave birth quickly?\\nIV Mom: 'Hard, hard' - that was my mindset, so during pregnancy I studied English, took English tests with a big belly... thinking as soon as the baby comes out, I'll get employed right away.\\nEasy Mom: Pregnant job seeker.\\nIV Mom: A pregnant woman appearing at TEPS [Test of English Proficiency developed by Seoul National University] exam sites.\\nChae In-taek: I should have met you then - I can't imagine what that situation would be like. What difficulties were there?\\nIV Mom: I took all the tests, got all the scores, and gave birth, but oh my, this wasn't the end. I had no plans at all. So I was like 'Oh my, what is this?' and started childcare. I couldn't sleep at night because of nursing. Waking up every 2-3 hours, crying that I'd have no wishes if I could just sleep 5 hours. Living a life that violates human rights for a long time, I gradually lost my mind. And the baby was sick early on, so dealing with that made it even later. I graduated from a good undergraduate school with excellent grades.\\nGood Wife: Didn't you graduate summa cum laude this time?\\nStamina Mom, Easy Mom: Graduate school summa cum laude.\\nChae In-taek: Is there summa cum laude in graduate school?\\nStamina Mom, Easy Mom: Yes, there is. Then you must go to graduation. You have to go and receive the award.\\nIV Mom: I didn't even know that and said, 'Ah, I have a part-time job that day, I'm also preparing for employment and have to take care of my child, so I'm busy and can't go,' and they said, 'What are you talking about?' You must come.\\nGood Wife: What part-time job? Sell one of your gold spoons.\\nChae In-taek: Sell one of your gold spoons.\\nEasy Mom: Still, you have to pay property tax.\\nChae In-taek: Taxes must be hard to pay too.\\nIV Mom: Anyway, people have to figure out how to make a living themselves. As humans. No matter what, it's too embarrassing to ask parents for money, so I tried somehow and studied. Since I originally studied well. I could do what I used to do, but when I tried to get employed after that, my age was already - the child should already be going to elementary school, and I was already at full age, with no career but with very high educational background and excellent grades.\\nGood Wife: Would they hire you?\\nChae In-taek: This is called the problem of late marriage. Especially now, many say late marriage is the biggest cause of low birth rate in overcoming the low birth rate problem. But even with early marriage - early marriage means career interruption, no, career hasn't even started yet.\\nIV Mom: Can't start.\\nGood Wife: Using fresh eggs, is that expression weird? Biologically giving birth to a very healthy child...\\nIV Mom: The child is really smart.\\nStamina Mom: Right, healthy too (haha).\\nEasy Mom: You two who gave birth early.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you seem too focused on biological determinism.\\nIV Mom: But my career is really unhealthy.\\nChae In-taek: The child is healthy, but mom's career is still pre-birth.\\nIV Mom: Yes. On my resume, after educational background, there's nothing to write.\\nEveryone: Resume has education, educational background. Summa cum laude (and that's it).\\nChae In-taek: I thought grades were one of the factors determining employment, not the decisive factor.\\nIV Mom: So from my parents' perspective, they're frustrated. 'She studied so well, I spent so much on hagwon education [Note: 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry in Korean context], sent her to such a good university, but (look at her now).'\\nChae In-taek: Spent money on education but can't even get employed (and is like this). Do they even say 'just' raising children, not 'at least'?\\nGood Wife: That's not 'could do' but something we always hear.\\nIV Mom: I heard it this morning too. Where are you going? When I said I'm going to do this, they asked if they'd give me a job there.\\nChae In-taek: We can't give you a job (haha).\\nIV Mom: They say that. No matter how much money I give you, you'll spend it all and live like that. Still, it's your own life, so you should handle it yourself. Will you live receiving everything from your husband like that? They say their heart bursts from morning. (But) I really understand that.\\nEasy Mom: Looking at property tax for decades, the property disappears.\\nIV Mom: So to keep the relationship between me and my child healthy and not severed, my career gets severed and becomes unhealthy.\\nChae In-taek: To maintain the relationship between child and mother, mother's career gets interrupted - you haven't even started yet, right? So far we've heard about everyone's trials. If there are trials, next comes overcoming them. Today, to overcome them, we're continuing this talk, but before discussing social and institutional matters, let me hear about what challenges you've taken on for overcoming, how much you've overcome, how much you plan to do in the future, or whether you believe you can do it. After trials comes the story of overcoming.\\nIV Mom: Since I just told my trial story, I'll go first. I'm Gold Spoon Mom, and I've studied a lot and worked hard to have a job related to my aptitude and major, but work-family balance is difficult.\\nChae In-taek: Work-family balance (is difficult)?\\nIV Mom: Yes. My major involves using many foreign languages, and I studied a lot centered on foreign languages, so there are business trips abroad for ten days at a time.\\nChae In-taek: While attending graduate school?\\nIV Mom: Yes. To work in that field or do such things.\\nStamina Mom: You can do it now, right?\\nIV Mom: Now it's possible. Because my child turned 8.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, if you want to work? Do you mean part-time jobs? Ah, jobs in that field are (like that)?\\nIV Mom: Yes, now that my child is about 8, even if I work full-time, even if I go abroad for ten days, care is possible. But before that, it was really difficult. So I decided, ah, a second child won't work.\\nChae In-taek: Before the second child is even born, according to situational logic (it doesn't work)?\\nIV Mom: There's no choice. Otherwise, I'd have no chance for career again.\\nChae In-taek: Doesn't our pretty daughter say things like 'Please give me a sibling as a gift'?\\nIV Mom: She did (haha). When nothing else works, I thought I should at least take the civil service exam, so I looked up related information and searched everything.\\nEasy Mom: What kind of civil service?\\nIV Mom: Low-level, the lowest level civil servant possible. One where I can go home quickly.\\nGood Wife: Right. Because responsibilities are small, you leave work early and can use leave.\\nIV Mom: Whatever work I do doesn't matter, regardless of age or anything, even if I just make coffee, as long as (I can go home quickly).\\nStamina Mom: Ah, that's too high quality.\\nAlice: No, but I thought about this a lot too. Because really, civil servants more than public institutions - civil servants actually leave work more punctually. They call at 5:30 and leave work themselves. Job security is guaranteed, and also when raising children, as people who are already a bit older know, there are quite many occasions when you need to suddenly leave. At such times, the types of leave are quite segmented. Half-day leave where you can use 4 hours out of 8-hour work, 2 hours you can use at the beginning or end - there are various types of leave that can be used conveniently. So for coexistence with childcare, there's no job as good as civil service. Because I also looked into research positions utilizing my major, but since I'm in a position where I have to raise a child anyway, I first have to look for large institutions with workplace daycare centers, and that institution has to consider my current home location or at least my husband's workplace location for pickup - I have to consider all of this, but research positions are mostly contract positions, which is our common fate. Nobody knows when or what might happen.\\nChae In-taek: The profession of researcher itself is a job without continuity or sustainability?\\nAlice: Yes. Considering all of that, and the risk of moving for something that might be cut anytime is tremendously risky to bear. So it's very difficult. Also, if I somehow struggle to write a resume even with small projects, finding a babysitter becomes a problem. Since there's none of that, high-level civil servants aren't 9 to 6 but definitely start from 9, but leaving work is almost the same as major corporations. So not high-level civil servants (but a level where I can leave work early).\\nGood Wife: A doctorate entering 9th grade.\\nChae In-taek: Even if not high-level positions, when I meet and hear from people who are enthusiastic or take the lead in new work in organizations, the most disappointing story is 'Civil servants leave work early,' 'I've never left work before 9 or 10 PM,' 'Then why do you work as a civil servant?' 'Because I like the work, it's rewarding. Some people become civil servants for the sense of purpose.' This is what they say, but we seem to overlook that part a lot. Too much hasty generalization is at work.\\nEasy Mom: Among civil servants too, those who get promoted and become high-ranking or such people don't live a civil servant life.\\nAlice: If you live that life, you can't balance it with childcare. Since my major continues to be public, to utilize my major while taking care of children and doing some work, civil service is optimal anyway.\\nStamina Mom: 7th grade is also high-level, you need to be about 9th grade.\\nIV Mom: Because it's frustrating, thoughts follow one after another like that.\\nChae In-taek: But while saying civil service is good and you'll pursue a career, even civil servants are overwhelmed with work, making proper childcare and work-family balance not easy?\\nEveryone: That's right.\\nChae In-taek: You're saying that. Still, it's relatively better.\\nEasy Mom: Because it's legally guaranteed.\\nChae In-taek: Legal status maintenance.\\nEasy Mom: In my case, I'm a part-time instructor.\\nChae In-taek: Easy Mom who works as a part-time instructor.\\nEasy Mom: I'm really lucky and thankful to have received a part-time instructor position for a long period, over 5 years.\\nChae In-taek: A whole 5 years?\\nEasy Mom: Yes, I'm now in my 6th year as an instructor. But now junior colleagues are getting appointed...\\nGood Wife: As professors?\\nChae In-taek: Ah, junior colleagues are getting professor appointments while you continue as a part-time instructor?\\nEasy Mom: Yes. Single junior colleagues who studied abroad getting appointed is natural. But seeing that, my instructor life is also like a fly's life, isn't it? At most until my forties. Not much time left.\\nChae In-taek: Are there social reasons why instructors in their forties should quit?\\nEasy Mom: Professors feel uncomfortable with instructors older than them. Schools do too. Some instructors are really just honey instructors who only teach, but most perform various projects the school wants in some classes or provide various conveniences to professors. It's more comfortable if it's a junior instructor rather than asking a senior, 'Please do this' or 'Please develop this student.' It's a structure where it's difficult to ask, so I'm preparing myself since I'm entering my 6th year.\\nChae In-taek: Junior colleagues get appointed as professors, and since you've been doing it for 6 years, newly graduating people also need part-time instructor positions, so senior people are pressured to make decisions based on first-in-first-out principles?\\nEasy Mom: Rather than receiving pressure, I instinctively feel 'it won't last much longer.' And what I'm thinking about is that part-time instructors - it's not full-time in terms of days, and even though you spend many hours per day, it's not 5 days a week, right? So I could balance childcare. But if not that, to properly care for two or more children, I'd have to leave work by 4-5 PM, but such workplaces don't exist. So I'm realistically planning my life after being a part-time instructor. Given our personality.\\nChae In-taek: You're saying that Korea's daycare centers and the structure of pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare were made based on non-existent workplaces and non-existent jobs. That's a shocking statement.\\nEasy Mom: That's right. So when preparing life after being a part-time instructor, I think 'Isn't self-employment the only way?' and I'm preparing small things now.\\nChae In-taek: Self-employed people might file complaints.\\nGood Wife: Self-employment isn't easy.\\nChae In-taek: 'Does self-employment look easy?'\\nGood Wife: Our house runs self-employment.\\nEasy Mom: Along with being a part-time instructor, I'm in my 3rd year of self-employment too. It's not easy.\\nChae In-taek: 'Try closing shop once (then you'll know how hard it is).'\\nEasy Mom: It's not easy. Really not easy. Ah, making a living is really daunting. I have career, teach, look flashy to others, but it's not easy. If it's not easy for me, how do other people live? Thinking about it really breaks my heart.\\nChae In-taek: To overcome career interruption, you think about self-employment, but almost everyone seems to say 'That's an insult to self-employment.' Then ultimately, the instructor career you've been doing for 6 years was a position that had a sunset anyway. Can we see it that way?\\nEasy Mom: Unless I get a professor appointment, yes, I think that's unavoidable. Professor appointment - being a woman and schools are decreasing now. It's really not easy. Even if you prepare to go to rural areas and live apart from husband and children as a weekend couple, chances come very rarely.\\nChae In-taek: I see. In efforts to overcome career interruption, family help, family understanding, family intervention, or family conflict seem very important. Earlier, almost all of you highly educated people heard 'Just take care of children,' and the path to utilize your accumulated career in society and for personal achievement - are you not receiving support within your families?\\nGood Wife: First, if you earn money, there's a numerical economic result. But studying in Korea has very limited scholarships, doesn't provide living expenses, and isn't considered labor. It's mainly seen as work for your intellectual interest, your satisfaction.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, like a hobby?\\nStamina Mom: Study you like doing.\\nChae In-taek: Study you like doing. You like doing it, so bear any damage yourself.\\nGood Wife: No, beyond that, 'Why are you causing damage to me?' 'Why are you causing damage to our children?' 'Why are you causing damage to our grandchildren?' - that's what in-laws say.\\nChae In-taek: Study and career-building study gets disparaged as hobby activities, luxury academics?\\nGood Wife: I studied social welfare and applied the knowledge and skills I learned to a population group in blind spots, and actually saw results. Legislation passed. And based on that, policies will be made. But my career, while it's written on my resume as what I did for 4 years, doesn't count toward seniority when I get employed.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, right. There's the seniority issue.\\nGood Wife: Yes. I'm now 35, but if I get employed now in research, I have to compete with 25-year-old master's graduates. But if that person was hired a year earlier, I'd be in a position to do copying that person orders. That's my current position. Then do I have to go there and do that? This is also (a concern).\\nChae In-taek: The workplace structure doesn't judge what this person can do and assign work accordingly, but '1st year, 2nd year' - 1st year, 2nd year determines organizational hierarchy and work priority. You're saying such workplace structure itself is problematic?\\nGood Wife: Right. Then is research the only job? Can't I go to social welfare field? But social welfare field involves very low pay and really labor and emotion-intensive work. Doing that while (raising two young children is difficult)...\\nChae In-taek: Don't other people do it?\\nGood Wife: Right, they're very dedicated people. People with dedication and self-sacrifice spirit do it, but if I go at this age, I'll be criticized by young dedicated social workers. 'Why do you leave work early?'\\nChae In-taek: 'To see children.' 'Are you showing off?' Like that?\\nGood Wife: Because it could become such a structure, it causes damage to them.\\nChae In-taek: Even within dedicated professions, there's an atmosphere where they can't fully recognize or support each other regarding childcare issues.\\nGood Wife: So when asked how I overcome this, I'm trying to endure this time a bit more. Since I started it anyway, 'Let's see the end of studying,' so 'I'll study for doctorate,' declaring to family and thinking 'Let's get cursed at for a few more years.'\\nChae In-taek: Isn't anyone receiving good support at home?\\nStamina Mom: I receive the most support.\\nChae In-taek: Oh, Stamina Mom receives support?\\nStamina Mom: Yes, more than others - it's my husband's support.\\nGood Wife: Envious.\\nAlice: The doctorate doesn't give good support.\\nStamina Mom: After marriage, having two children and doing gambling-like entrance exams, my husband did more part-time work for that. Both of us couldn't sleep. Husband couldn't sleep from working, I couldn't sleep from studying. But coming to university and studying - is it naturally the kind of work that integrates you into society? For me, it's not that kind of work. To earn money, I could do lessons. Lessons would earn good money because in Korea, entrance exam-related work earns the best money. Since I also did tutoring, tutoring could earn money, but to do what I want while taking care of our children, (nothing) works. So just like when going to university, I continue going solo.\\nChae In-taek: 'Like a rhinoceros horn, go alone.' This seems to be the summary. Then I heard there are many systems from national or local governments for career-interrupted women. Has anyone tried using them?\\nGood Wife: For us to use them, the systems are a bit (insufficient). First, there's a place called 'Women's New Work Center' created by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Ministry of Employment and Labor to promote economic activities of career-interrupted women.\\nChae In-taek: 'Women's New Work Center'?\\nGood Wife: Yes, so it's called 'New Work Center.'\\nChae In-taek: New Work Center.\\nGood Wife: The name is really pretty. Korean people are good at naming.\\nChae In-taek: Is it a place for sales? It's new work.\\nGood Wife: Maybe a dumping center. But what they do is career counseling, vocational education, employment connection, follow-up management - the words sound really good. But what goes into vocational education? According to 2014 statistics, among 9.6 million married women, 3.9 million are non-employed women. And 2.14 million women quit work due to family care.\\nChae In-taek: Oh, that many?\\nGood Wife: Yes. They're probably distributed by age group. By age. But what are the job training contents?

I'm Hyochangdong's pride, Good Wife and Wise Mother.\\nEveryone: (Haha)\\nChae In-taek: As soon as you all said your nicknames, laughter burst out.\\nGood Wife: No, it's not like that. The elderly people in our neighborhood like me.\\nChae In-taek: We have five people here, how about the other two?\\nStrong Body Mom (hereafter Strong Mom): I'm Strong Body Mom.\\nChae In-taek: Yes, I can picture that image.\\nGolden Spoon IV Mom (hereafter IV Mom): I'm Golden Spoon IV Mom.\\nChae In-taek: You have a golden spoon but you're on an IV - pure and pitiful, frail, frequent minor illnesses?\\nIV Mom: Close to frail.\\nChae In-taek: Endlessly close to frail... Ah, should I understand this as a name reflecting the reality where children are healthy but mothers raising children become endlessly frail?\\nIV Mom: Yes. (Haha)\\nChae In-taek: Oh, you answered very vigorously.\\nIV Mom: Yes, that's right!\\nChae In-taek: As expected, when stories about overcoming low birth rates come up, voices get louder in this atmosphere.\\nGood Wife: It has to be that way.\\nIV Mom: I powered up briefly before coming today.\\nGood Wife: You sparkled for a moment.\\nChae In-taek: I'll think of it as power going up with strong charging. Today's topic is immigration. It could be an exodus. Countries good for raising children, countries good for working while raising children, countries with evenings, countries where the whole family can comfortably talk about the future - our country falls short in these areas. So it's Hell Joseon [a derogatory term combining 'hell' and 'Joseon,' referring to Korea's harsh living conditions]. There are even such expressions. Then wouldn't it be better to escape and go somewhere else? There are many people making such extreme arguments. Do any of you have such thoughts?\\nAlice: Yes, I seriously (thought about it).\\nChae In-taek: Nakseongdae Alice, you seriously thought about it?\\nAlice: I seriously did. With my husband. Because I had worked on Nepal-related projects for about 4 years before.\\nChae In-taek: Nepal?\\nAlice: Yes. I worked on Nepal-related projects for about 4 years.\\nChae In-taek: What kind of work did you do in Nepal?\\nAlice: If I talk specifically, my advisor professor might know.\\nChae In-taek: Was it related to quality of life in Nepal?\\nAlice: Related to improving quality of life.\\nChae In-taek: It wasn't about Nepal's defense capabilities, right? Ah, while working on quality of life, you seemed to be attracted to that?\\nAlice: Rather than being attracted to the culture there, when I went and met the local situation and local Koreans, I was attracted to the lives of the local Koreans.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, not the locals but the lives of Koreans?\\nAlice: Koreans living there.\\nChae In-taek: How did they live?\\nAlice: First of all, the cost of living was unrealistically cheap. So even though we don't have much, even if I received 2.5 million won [approximately $1,900 USD], which is the maximum for a doctoral student, I would be upper class there.\\nChae In-taek: Living lavishly?\\nAlice: Yes, living lavishly (and comfortably). My husband wouldn't need to work at that level.\\nChae In-taek: If he doesn't work, can you put him to other uses?\\nAlice: Just me alone (earning would be enough).\\nChae In-taek: Like chopping firewood or being a shutter man?\\nAlice: Oh, I don't even want him to do shutters. He could just lie at home and that would be enough.\\nChae In-taek: I'll take that as 'I'd be satisfied as long as he doesn't work overtime and come home at midnight.'\\nAlice: Yes, the cost of living was that cheap. Also, on the other hand, Chinese pesticides were very expensive for those people, so pesticide-free local food was (common instead).\\nEveryone: Hahaha.\\nChae In-taek: This is eco-friendly and pesticide-free, but the reason is that even cheap Chinese products are too expensive economically, so they don't use them much (which is good). Ah, that's quite paradoxical.\\nAlice: There were many local, fresh, safe vegetables. Live-in housekeepers at that time - though it's only been a few years, anyway about 5 years ago - for 200-300,000 won [approximately $150-230 USD] per month, they would live in and do everything.\\nChae In-taek: Compared to prices in Korea, almost one-tenth?\\nAlice: About that price. Moreover, there were surprisingly many places where you could communicate in English. Also, as a Korean, even without utilizing my major, there were many things I could do like NGO work, but with small skills like (for example) baking or beauty services - although there would be a long adaptation period due to local water and local flour conditions - if you could adapt to even that, you could generate some income with such skills without living lavishly. Korean dramas were becoming popular there, and the image of Koreans was quite good because of the Korean Wave.\\nChae In-taek: There's the Korean Wave and no bad image of Koreans yet, continuing to have a good image?\\nAlice: Since there were people who wanted to learn Korean, you could become a Korean language instructor if you wanted to.\\nEasy Mom: Isn't Nepali somewhat similar to Korean?\\nAlice: They say the word order is exactly the same.\\nChae In-taek: English speakers are called the global generation, so young people anywhere in the world can make basic living as English instructors. Just traveling abroad for a few years in youth, or some people live their whole lives like that. There are countries where you can do this by teaching Korean, and that's Nepal.\\nAlice: Yes.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, there are such good opportunities, so what were you thinking of doing if you went there?\\nAlice: In my case, there were quite many things I could do. I had originally received proposals from the NGO side. So I could do that. In my husband's case, since he works in logistics and trade, it was work he could do anywhere abroad. Actually at that time, though it's now changed to personal business, the company he was initially at recommended he go as a stationed employee in India. My husband was also willing. These things became more focused as I went through pregnancy and childbirth, because if we went to Nepal or India, since we're foreigners, we could send our child to international schools.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, I see.\\nAlice: We could send them to international schools.\\nChae In-taek: What about the cost?\\nAlice: Much cheaper. Much cheaper than sending our child to international schools in our country.\\nChae In-taek: How would it compare to sending them to our regular schools and investing in hagwon education?\\nAlice: Cheaper than that too. There, they would basically know English, and I could teach Korean, so Korean and even the local language. Moreover, when graduating from school and going to university, depending on what the parents do, admission to universities in English-speaking countries and Europe would be easier. From what I've seen. And if they wanted domestic university admission, they could do hagwon education anyway, so it would be much (better).\\nChae In-taek: They could do hagwon education anyway? What about people who can't do that?\\nEasy Mom: And there are overseas Korean admission programs.\\nChae In-taek: You're saying the qualifications become more advantageous anyway?\\nAlice: So educationally, it looked much, much more advantageous. Moreover, since I was targeting developing countries, I would actually be freer from racial discrimination. So I really seriously, until just recently, talked a lot about 'should we really go?'\\nChae In-taek: If you went there, the burden of childcare would be much less than in Korea, and the child would play much more joyfully than in Korea, and parents could see the child's face brighten up. Did you think like that?\\nAlice: If we went there, we could have (a second child too).\\nStrong Mom: I'd have a third.\\nEasy Mom: I'd have a fourth.\\nGood Wife: Breathing that clean Himalayan air, what couldn't you do?\\nAlice: I thought about it quite a lot. Though I'm hesitant now due to earthquake problems.\\nChae In-taek: What's the reason for hesitation?\\nAlice: Earthquakes. Natural disasters.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, Nepal earthquakes. Not everything can be perfect.\\nEasy Mom: The air in Kathmandu is bad.\\nAlice: Setting aside whether it's safe from natural disasters, I really considered it quite a lot.\\nChae In-taek: What about other people?\\nGood Wife: My husband has a green card. A US green card. My mother-in-law is now a citizen, and all her siblings live in America. So my husband, when doctoral studies got difficult, ran away to America, and what did he do there? He got tons of certifications. My husband is very good at studying.\\nEasy Mom: Certification killer.\\nChae In-taek: Even certification studies!\\nGood Wife: He's only good at studying. (Haha) So.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, let's keep that as a family secret.\\nGood Wife: Yes, since names aren't mentioned. So he got many certifications.\\nStrong Mom: American certifications?\\nGood Wife: Right. American, what, architect?\\nEasy Mom: Not architect.\\nGood Wife: Architectural supervisor? He also got real estate. Each state has different ones, and he got those. So what happens is, just by signing these, with one certification, he could make a decent living per month just by signing - that's what he heard in the Korean community. But our family members have somewhat of a moral perfectionism. So if he did that, he'd say 'How can I, with my conscience,' 'With my scholar's conscience,' and he brought hardship upon himself.\\nChae In-taek: He considers himself a scholar.\\nGood Wife: He got his PhD. Anyway, he's a scholar for now.\\nChae In-taek: Since he almost hit the streets, that conscience, good sense, and awareness are remarkable.\\nGood Wife: So when I get too angry sometimes, I add the character 'starving' in front and call him a scholar, asking 'Are you Heosaeng from the Tale of Heosaeng?' But anyway, you know, since we have a residence permit, a green card, we think about it. My mother-in-law often says 'You guys come over.'\\nChae In-taek: But what was the biggest reason that appealed to you most? What was the biggest reason Hyochangdong Good Wife thought about immigration?\\nGood Wife: The biggest reason is children's education costs. Also, as I mentioned before, I don't really like hagwon education, and the ranking culture in public education was very painful. Not recognizing any originality? Looking at my sons' tendencies, I'm not sure if they'd be happy entering Korea's public education system. So I sometimes think about it. But the reason I ultimately didn't actively choose that after weighing pros and cons is the gun problem, and another thing is that I...\\nChae In-taek: You mean school shooting accidents that occasionally happen?\\nGood Wife: Yes. And another thing is, if we go there, even though Korea recognizes me as a member of society regardless of income, if we go to America, we'd immediately be guests or immigrants, somewhat (excluded from that society).\\nStrong Mom: Foreigners.\\nGood Wife: Right. We'd have to live as second-class, third-class citizens in that position. And living as a class doing menial jobs in society felt somewhat... So actually, if we can do meaningful work here, work that changes society and contributes to society, wouldn't it be better to endure here even if it's difficult?\\nChae In-taek: So you gave up the idea? But if you had gone, do you think the children's education would have worked out as you thought?\\nGood Wife: There are cases that worked out well and cases that didn't. So when I look closely at acquaintances who went to America for degree programs while having children, it definitely looks less difficult than Korea. So although I haven't observed long-term, I think the infrastructure for raising children of that age group is better established than Korea.\\nChae In-taek: I see. If you had gone, were you hoping for a third child?\\nGood Wife: I decided not to have more children with this man.\\nChae In-taek: Yes, let me quickly hear from the next people.\\nStrong Mom: My child is entering middle school.\\nChae In-taek: Strong Mom, are you thinking of pioneering an immigrant life with your child entering middle school, based on your physical strength?\\nStrong Mom: It's because of education.\\nChae In-taek: Education is the biggest issue?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, it's education. I also grew up receiving almost no hagwon education. I didn't receive any at all, and I don't like hagwon education either. But if you ask whether public education is good, that's not the case either.\\nChae In-taek: You can't leave everything to public education. Is that what you mean?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, if you do your best in just public education, you get cut out like radish kimchi. That's what I think.\\nChae In-taek: Oh really? Rather than doing well, you're worried that outstanding students might actually be disliked by various people and teachers, like 'the nail that sticks out gets hammered down'?\\nStrong Mom: There's that too, but the evaluation system itself for being recognized in any society, for being first place, for doing something well - you have to be good at everything. I'm not saying radish kimchi is bad, but you come out as a standardized product. You come out as an excellent student, a model student.\\nChae In-taek: It's hard to see your second generation with individuality. Is that what you mean?\\nStrong Mom: Moreover, my child is showing talent in art, but this talent, through Korea's entrance exam system and Korea's education, keeps ranking and repeating. That ranking sometimes helps with competition, but I think it's not good for an original artistic world. There's that aspect too. And in terms of lifestyle too. In our country, it's really a desperate problem for children. Because it's adolescence. They just go in the morning and come back after studying all night. Even children who adapt well to that. I don't want to send my child through adolescence like this and make them emotionally dry. I'd rather immigrate and study myself, so studying while raising a child would be better.\\nChae In-taek: The mother would go as an international student to study, and let the child receive education that allows them to freely express their individuality according to local standards.\\nStrong Mom: And they'd learn English.\\nChae In-taek: That's your hope. Do you have thoughts about (a third child)?\\nStrong Mom: I actually had thoughts of having more, but couldn't because of entrance exams. Because I had my first and second children at twenty-four and twenty-six. I would have had more until thirty. But if I did that, my life wouldn't work out. But if work-life balance were possible, why wouldn't I have more children?\\nChae In-taek: If you could balance your career and life as a mother, you would have gladly had more children, but you gave up additional births due to current environment and circumstances? Already about three people could have more. If our country just had the background, environment, and systems like those foreign countries we think of, if we fixed these, there would be sufficient possibility.\\nStrong Mom: Yes, there is. Of course.\\nChae In-taek: So you still have confidence in many possibilities, but you need to get an IV, Golden Spoon IV Mom, you're relatively young here, so I'd like to hear your opinion.\\nIV Mom: My husband kept wanting to go abroad, but I thought it was better to stay in Korea, and since we've lived in Korea, shouldn't we continue living in Korea? I lived complacently. But once I actually started childcare and had a child, it wasn't easy, so that firm resolve is slightly shaking. But for now, I'm still struggling to settle well and live in Korea. I hope this energy continues.\\nGood Wife: Golden Spoon has assets.\\nIV Mom: Yes, that's right.\\nChae In-taek: Does having assets make it (different)? Are there no other reasons?\\nIV Mom: It is comfortable, honestly.\\nChae In-taek: Culturally comfortable to live?\\nIV Mom: Because all my friends and parents are in Korea.\\nChae In-taek: All the human networks are here.\\nIV Mom: Since there's no major financial burden.\\nChae In-taek: Then why did you have only one child despite all this?\\nIV Mom: But if I want to work or pursue a career, having a second would be difficult. Even for me in this situation.\\nChae In-taek: If you have more children, it would be difficult for you to achieve social success. You want to continue studying, get a job and work, and feel rewarded, but even one child is difficult?\\nIV Mom: Yes. And since I know how precious assets are, I have such a strong thought that I must pass this much to my child. If I have one more, it gets divided.\\nAlice: Are you thinking about inheritance from now?\\nIV Mom: If I don't plan this, I think it will be too difficult for the child. Their future.\\nChae In-taek: Poor people worry because they don't have enough, rich people worry it might be divided.\\nEasy Mom: We've never thought about this.\\nGood Wife: As long as we don't pass on debt.\\nIV Mom: Should I buy one more house? I have to calculate these things.\\nChae In-taek: They say a person with a thousand seok [traditional unit of grain] has a thousand worries, a person with ten thousand seok has ten thousand worries. Let me listen. What about Pyeongchon Easy Mom?\\nEasy Mom: When I was in college, I lived in America for a few months and became very close with Korean-Americans. Since I went with my father, I mainly had no friends of my own, and my father's friends filled my daily life. Those Korean-Americans all said the same thing. If you have money, Korea is more comfortable and better to live in. Good convenience facilities, good transportation, convenient 24 hours, many friends. They said that, and even though they had money, they absolutely wouldn't come back. But when I thought about it after getting married, I think there are mainly two things. Housing costs are too high. When I lived in America, I only visited places like New York, but lived in rural areas like Oklahoma.\\nChae In-taek: Where rent is cheap and quiet?\\nEasy Mom: Of course. If my husband and I sold our current house and went there, I know the quality of life would be much higher.\\nChae In-taek: High real estate prices suppress quality of life. We can see it that way.\\nEasy Mom: Yes. America is also expensive in places like New York, but there's much more land that isn't. Housing costs are really a big problem, and then another problem that really can't be solved is the education problem everyone mentioned. I also didn't grow up ordinarily, but I keep predicting that my child probably won't be very suitable for public education or able to grow well in public education either. So if we continue living in Korea, children like mine who are somewhat unique will have no choice but to depend on hagwon education.\\nChae In-taek: How is your child unique?\\nEasy Mom: Well, they act somewhat unusually.\\nChae In-taek: We can hear that as having individuality?\\nEasy Mom: There's individuality, and if they're interested in something, they tend to dig into it.\\nGood Wife: Anyone listening would think it's a grown child.\\nEasy Mom: It's a three-year-old.\\nAlice: 25 months.\\nChae In-taek: A three-year-old, 25-month-old child, and you're saying 'Our child has genius qualities but we can't handle it.'\\nEasy Mom: But I'm really worried.\\nChae In-taek: There might be bigger issues, not issues but bigger challenges ahead.\\nEasy Mom: Yes. It's only 3-4 years until elementary school preparation, which I really feel is not far away. The education problem is really an unsolvable part.\\nChae In-taek: But listening to you, Korean-American adults in America said living in Korea is convenient. It's good for playing, living, and eating Korean food, but are Korea's conditions really good for having and raising children?\\nEasy Mom: Not at all.\\nChae In-taek: Not at all?\\nEasy Mom: Yes. Not at all.\\nChae In-taek: Then compared to other countries we think of, what are the biggest problems?\\nAlice: What's good about our country is for healthy adult men to play and live, but it's not necessarily good for diverse population groups - academic terms are coming out - (of all age distributions). Various age distributions, different ages from children to elderly, for instance, if we go abroad, all people have roads that are difficult to walk on, but when we Koreans usually see it, they say 'Are roads this well-made?' but (in reality) it's hard to push baby strollers and elderly people (just have trouble walking).\\nChae In-taek: You mean things like curbs?\\nAlice: Yes. Starting from that. Safety is also a problem - I hurt my leg and went on crutches. When you use one crutch, I was a person who was healthy and then had surgery for one ankle problem. Even a previously healthy person, if someone bumps into you, it's really (hard to endure).\\nGood Wife: You fall down.\\nAlice: The impact is very big, but Korean people don't consider such things at all. Starting from things like facilities (there are problems too).\\nChae In-taek: When we bump into someone, we say 'Sorry, excuse me.' In Europe, they say 'Pardon.' But we have a culture where if we bump into someone and they're not seriously hurt, we just pass by, not caring much about each other for a long time?\\nAlice: And if you're even slightly unusual, everyone turns around to look at you like you're a foreigner. Such gazes. These things work in various ways. But for someone like me considering immigration to developing countries, probably ordinary people like me, not golden spoon people, would have thought about it a lot. The biggest risk is definitely security. In Nepal's case, I often saw them using local security companies, but the problem becomes how much you can trust those security companies.\\nChae In-taek: If you immigrate to advanced countries, there's cost, and if you go to developing countries, there's the security problem. You'd have to consider such problems.\\nAlice: You absolutely must consider it. Depending on whether the security risks or my various dissatisfactions or anxieties when living in Korea are higher, you make the decision. For us, anyway, we think it might be more advantageous to live in Korea, so we decide to stay.\\nGood Wife: 'From cradle to grave' is the motto of welfare states. Thinking from infancy through middle age to old age, in our country, the pre-adult period is a vulnerable group. Educationally, you have to invest a lot in human resources to function as a person and find a job, right? Before that, there are childcare problems. And on top of that, if you're a woman, problems arise even after getting employed. Childbirth and housework. And when you become elderly, poverty and health problems arise. Current Korean society is improving a lot. It's improving a lot, but currently in Korean society, if you're sick, elderly, female, or an infant/toddler, it's a society with very high anxiety. Because social security is low. But if you have money, you can fill that gap, so it's a structure where you can fill it if you have money.\\nStrong Mom: But usually earning 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] per month isn't easy. Generally. Even if men work really hard with strength and body, many households can't earn that much. But if you can't fill it with money, if you maintain the lowest level of life and environment, it's a very bad situation.\\nChae In-taek: You've mentioned very dissatisfying aspects of Korean society as broad factors. Let's look for specific factors, clear small factors. In what cases did you think 'Ah, I really should leave this country, leave Korea'? Some people around me thought that when they waited in line for daycare and ultimately weren't selected.\\nEasy Mom: Yes, that could happen.\\nChae In-taek: Could you share your personal experiences?\\nGood Wife: I've shared my personal story before. My father lost his job during the IMF foreign exchange crisis and felt defeated, so he was sick for a long time, about 10 years, and then passed away. So we had no choice but to sell what little assets we had and use them, and when he finally passed away in the hospital, enormous medical bills came out. But insurance didn't cover this. Our country has health insurance, but coverage for cheap diseases is quite extensive. But for major diseases, though they say much is covered, that's not the case. Also, if it's contagious, you have to be quarantined in a single room, and you have to pay for that yourself. We're aging very rapidly and there are many accidents, but if medical coverage is low despite having a national health insurance system, the anxiety is too (great). We can only exert strength if our bodies are at least healthy. At that time, I thought a lot, 'Ah, our country has systems but the coverage is really weak.'\\nChae In-taek: Since coverage isn't 100%, while raising children, you can feel anxiety about what might happen.\\nGood Wife: We pay health insurance premiums per household, but still need to pay about 500,000 won [approximately $380 USD] per month for various insurances like cancer insurance and actual expense insurance for each family member to feel secure.\\nEasy Mom: Even then, rare incurable diseases are difficult.\\nChae In-taek: There are countries like America where 20 million citizens receive no medical coverage or protection?\\nGood Wife: But young children and elderly are covered. Through Medicare and Medicaid.\\nChae In-taek: 20 million people fall through the cracks there.\\nGood Wife: But that's because of privatization - so that's America's problem too. Privatization lets insurance companies hold hegemony and shake things around as they please.\\nChae In-taek: America never had public insurance.\\nStrong Mom: So many people do it in Canada.\\nChae In-taek: Canada is the European way. They provide virtually free medical services through taxes, but that gets criticized for high taxes. The middle ground is our insurance system, but insurance doesn't cover 100% so there are problems. We need to continuously make efforts, but from the perspective of raising children, you often think about the anxiety that 'this might become a burden later'?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, that's right. And I'm anxious because of education. It's not a structure where talented people who want to study do so, but where people with money educate their children and people with money become gifted - I think 'this isn't right.' So I often think 'I want to leave this country.'\\nChae In-taek: Ah, when hagwon education costs become too high for children and you feel like they're being educated uniformly, you felt inner rage?\\nStrong Mom: Because of money, even if they have talent...\\nChae In-taek: Cases where talent can't be nurtured due to money?\\nStrong Mom: There are many such cases.\\nIV Mom: I paid for everything financially, but when I'm forced into traditional gender roles, I want to leave.\\nChae In-taek: What do you mean women should do? Women should be like this.\\nIV Mom: I bought the house myself. The house is my money, the car is my money, and living expenses are mostly my money. Since I'm not the type to force traditional male roles, I coolly paid for everything, but housework and childcare are my share, and career interruption is also my share - that made me furious. There's something that money can't solve at one level.\\nChae In-taek: Living as a mother in this land, all the burdens - even though you actively lived and shared all burdens equally, in the end childcare is what women should do.\\nIV Mom: When someone says 'Why is the house so messy?' I get restless.\\nChae In-taek: Housework is also what women should do. They even force responsibility. Is that so?\\nIV Mom: There's such silent pressure.\\nChae In-taek: When elders come and say 'Why is the child's mother like this?' 'Look at those clothes piled up.' 'Is the washing machine just for decoration?'\\nIV Mom: I bought everything with my money. But hearing such words, I felt sad thinking 'Ah, gender equality is still somewhat difficult.'\\nAlice: For me, this came as a triple combo. My father had a brain hemorrhage and was bedridden for about 20 years before passing away just a month ago. (Medical coverage problems) were like that. In my case, I wanted to study but really couldn't help it, so I kept working at companies then studying, working then studying, and naturally time passed. Oh my, (thanks to parents) people who went abroad were studying like that without spending much money. So I felt 'What is this world?' and 'What am I exactly?' Having to resent my parents after turning 30 - this kind of thing came.\\nChae In-taek: You felt like you didn't get enough opportunities for self-development?\\nAlice: The starting lines were different. Even the method of reaching the starting line - because my parents couldn't receive such education, my parents couldn't teach me 'Where is the starting line?' I can't resent them. It was natural for that generation.\\nEasy Mom: That was their best effort.\\nGood Wife: My uncle told me to marry an agricultural successor.\\nChae In-taek: What was the reason?\\nGood Wife: Because agricultural successors have money so I could live comfortably. Before that, he told me to work at a factory.\\nAlice: My parents said if I went to commercial high school and got a job at a bank, I could marry really well. But anyway, I worked tremendously hard and have longer and thicker educational credentials than my husband. But it's taken for granted that I should do all the housework, so when all this came together, 'Geez, what kind of situation is this?'\\nChae In-taek: Whatever effort I make?\\nAlice: I can't escape from it.\\nChae In-taek: All the work women should do in traditional gender roles is my share? I raise children and do housework. Even so, they ask 'Why can't you earn money?' 'Isn't studying something you want to do?' You hear such things? Ah, this would resonate with very many people.\\nIV Mom: Hands are going up everywhere.\\nChae In-taek: Hands are going up one after another.\\nEasy Mom: I earn money too. I do housework too. I actively raise my child, have a good relationship with my husband, and my husband has the heart to try hard for work-life balance. Nevertheless, when I think such thoughts, it's this. My husband needs to come home by 11 PM if he comes early. When work breaks out at the company, seriously he once came home at 4:30 AM. I really cried the next morning because he left at 6:30 AM. He came home, washed, slept for an hour. I'm so worried about my husband's health. Our child asks 'Did daddy go on a business trip?' And last night too, hearing daddy come home, they woke up and played happily with daddy until after midnight. But I recently saw an article saying Korean infants lack sleep time globally, and my heart ached. Parents come home late, so they spend 1-2 hours trying to see more of their faces, and infants end up like that, don't they? I'm really - our family isn't golden spoon or anything, but we've lived diligently and are trying to live diligently as middle class, yet I'm so anxious. When my husband goes to work after sleeping 1-2 hours like that, I'm so anxious. It's the same for me. When I go to lecture at provincial universities, I've honestly often gone after sleeping 1-2 hours. When I live such a life, at every moment I constantly think 'Ah, isn't living here not the right answer?'\\nChae In-taek: Ah, I can see tears now. You seem to feel tremendous pressure about this consumptive life. As a result, you can't properly pursue family values, and it's really difficult to have minimum cozy time between family members. Even adults and children can't get enough sleep in such reality - you expressed dissatisfaction about this. Do you think if you immigrated, many of these problems could be solved?\\nGood Wife: There's a scholar named Esping-Andersen. This person talked about something called the decommodification index. What is decommodification? Basic goods and services for survival and living don't need to be purchased with money. Or the purchase cost is very low. In that case, the decommodification index is high. Countries people usually want to immigrate to are countries where such basic services are socialized, with higher public expenditure than individual burden. Looking earlier, Canada has very low medical costs. Nordic countries have low education and medical costs. Even America, which is the worst hell for medical costs, can be seen as having less educational cost burden than our country.\\nChae In-taek: I see. Countries where basic things are guaranteed. Such countries would be necessary. A society where you don't have to invest all your time, worry, and go into debt for food, housing, medical care, and education, yet still can't make it - there might be such societies, so you think about immigration. But if such a society existed, would the low birth rate problem be largely solved?\\nStrong Mom: Yes. Of course.\\nEasy Mom: Even sleeping 1-2 hours, I want to have a second child.\\nChae In-taek: Even sleeping 1-2 hours, you hope to have a second child, but if you could sleep enough and not have to invest enormously in basic necessities, you could expect a third child?\\nEasy Mom: I'm considering third, even fourth children.\\nStrong Mom: Me too.\\nChae In-taek: I see. So far, talking about immigration, you've said such a world seems to await if you immigrate. Under such conditions and environments, you'd want to have more children. Then we could change our country itself to match that. We could think about it that way, couldn't we? What aspects would you like to see changed?\\nIV Mom: First of all, we jokingly say that if Korea had housing, cars, jobs, parents' retirement secured, no sick people at home, and this state was sustainable, we'd live comfortably.\\nEasy Mom: That's fiction. Fiction. Where is such a house?\\nIV Mom: But this is too much individual responsibility.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, Alice in Wonderland? (Haha)\\nIV Mom: Individuals have to buy houses with their own money, individuals have to solve their career problems whether it gets interrupted or not, parents' retirement is also their responsibility, and if there are sick people at home, coverage and everything is also their responsibility.\\nChae In-taek: Especially having and raising children is also your responsibility. The atmosphere is like 'Please solve the low birth rate problem on your own.'\\nIV Mom: That's too severe. I'll vote diligently for those who will change many systems, monitor diligently, and make continuous efforts - no, I'll make continuous requests. I'll keep making requests.\\nChae In-taek: Rather than just voting, let's work together?\\nEasy Mom: Since you pay a lot of taxes, you should make many requests.\\nChae In-taek: Since you pay little taxes, you probably won't make many requests?\\nEasy Mom: No, that's not it.\\nChae In-taek: Regardless of tax amount, as citizens and members of society, to make our community better, we should request what needs requesting and say what needs saying?\\nIV Mom: Yes, so I hope it becomes a society where we live together.\\nChae In-taek: A world where we live together. If we live together, regardless of your conditions - whether you earn well or have good conditions - everyone basically has the necessary environment and conditions fulfilled, so you'd want to raise children together in this country. Overcoming the low birth rate problem.\\nGood Wife: I think in the same context. But shouldn't we speak up? I should voice my opinion. I don't mean rights struggles or protests.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you don't mean that?\\nGood Wife: No, not that. I'm a moderate person. As you can see, I'm moderate and conservative.\\nChae In-taek: Not conservative but boss-like?\\nGood Wife: A conservative woman. When I said I'd appear here, my husband said 'Oh, we should live long and thin. Don't make your heart flutter, just stay quiet.' Then I got feisty and said 'No. I'm going.' So my husband said 'When a woman's voice goes beyond the house fence...'\\nStrong Mom: Ew, that stinks.\\nGood Wife: The smell of rusting swords. Because it's conservative and old-fashioned.\\nChae In-taek: Are your household terms of address like 'Wife, what shall we have for dinner?' 'Husband, let's eat that pair of chicks released in the backyard'?\\nGood Wife: I'm vegetarian.\\nEveryone: Hahaha.\\nChae In-taek: Very traditional, but your diet is Western.\\nGood Wife: Yesterday I was eating mackerel and got a video call, so I got scolded a lot. Anyway, I think we should voice our opinions. Because Korean people think 'the nail that sticks out gets hammered' and 'if you stay quiet, you'll get by average,' so they don't say what they should say. So people with decision-making authority need to hear voices to have good intentions and make efforts for improvement, but if the majority with opinions stays silent, there's no basis for creating change. The most important work I did while organizing and leading Mom's New [a mothers' advocacy group] was creating survey reports. Nobody helped with that, but I found a few people and said 'Let's make this together,' initially making a pilot survey report and distributing it everywhere. Sending it to the government, schools, emailing it. When I started voicing opinions like that, well-intentioned decision-makers began worrying and saying 'Okay, let's try making this.' But I'm worried about sharing this because some might say 'Well, you learned enough, so at least voice your opinion.' Actually, most of us graduated from university these days. If we stay silent, if we don't voice our opinions, we can't create a basis for change. Especially mothers raise children. We have to create the world these children will live in. What I worry about most is - I raised my sons well, but I sent them to the military and some unknown guy beat them up and they became strange, or guns are (also a problem). That's my biggest fear. So when my son goes to the military, I plan to organize a 'Military Culture Improvement Mothers' Association' to confront the Ministry of Defense.\\nStrong Mom: Yes. Good. I have a son too.\\nGood Wife: We have to. Voice opinions and monitor.\\nChae In-taek: He could enlist as an officer.\\nStrong Mom: So I keep looking for such things. 'Interpreter soldier? Should I make him learn Arabic?' I think like this.\\nGood Wife: But I alone avoiding it won't work. Just raising my child well (won't do). Because the environment is too dangerous. So we need to make efforts to improve the environment and invite all our politicians, heads of administration, and administrators. We have power. One vote may seem small, but when Korean mothers gather, don't we have strength?\\nStrong Mom: So while I can't do other things, you know these movements exist, I support such things. People who directly research and work on such things have many thoughts, but we can elect legislators who advocate such policies. It's not a difficult task - just (voting). I try to do that. So I try to solve it through public means, but if we work hard like that, probably the next generation will see the benefits. At least 10 years later.\\nChae In-taek: Change is needed. Everyone acknowledges the validity, legitimacy, and necessity of change, but in what direction would you like to see change? Please each share one thing you'd like to see fixed, introduced, or escape from.\\nAlice: This comes from my personal experience, and it appears in actual data too. Looking at our 30-40s generation, which is most economically active and also very active in child production and rearing, because social services and medical care for the elderly aren't properly established, we bear that medical burden directly. Also, those elderly people didn't know about insurance at that time and had perceptions that insurance salespeople were scammers. So they don't even have that much. So we're the generation bearing that medical burden while simultaneously having children late in life due to late marriage. Because we have both burdens, we've become a generation that can't do anything. So I hope this problem gets solved. Also, I think Korea has considerable mental health problems. Because if the core generation of 30s, 40s, 50s is in this state, the younger generation we're supporting and the elderly generation we're supporting can't be mentally sound. How does this appear as OECD suicide rate #1? I think it now appears in statistics too. So all these problems need to be solved together - mental health problems resolved, economy activated - I think all this comes together.\\nChae In-taek: A country you want to live in without immigrating, a country where your children can grow up well - making such a country through systematic improvements?\\nAlice: Yes. So as previous speakers said, it's definitely socially necessary, but I have a personality that needs to be coy in the back, so how I'm making efforts is that my major always included 'public.' Now I'm studying public health.\\nGood Wife: She revealed it.\\nAlice: No, public health has many areas. Professor, sorry.\\nGood Wife: That professor is a very cool person. I respect them.\\nChae In-taek: Public health sociology, health economics, demography? There are many fields. Since it's already late, you don't need to say that.\\nAlice: Anyway, since I'm majoring in public health, through research - ah, there are quite many people who do research and write columns. I think this is also one kind of voice. Personally, I try to make efforts in that area.\\nChae In-taek: Let's voice our opinions. And those who can research should research to give strength to voices, those who vote should use their votes, those who do community activities should work in various ways in communities - let's make a country where children can really grow up well?\\nIV Mom: Yes. Two big things for me. A country with evenings where work-life balance is possible, and safe childcare facilities and education for children. I hope such a country was my motherland where I was born.\\nEasy Mom: I'm in the same context. My highest goal is also life with evenings. And a society where work-life balance is possible. I have a daughter. Though I came to a top university and am struggling to work, I don't want to pass on this life to her. So as a mother with a daughter, I'll work my whole life and need to show the example of a working mother. Children learn by watching parents. To practice that, work-life balance - even though it's very difficult now, I'll continue striving to pioneer the model of work-life balance somehow. Then there's lifelong career. My grandfather is alive and my husband's grandmother is alive. So when my daughter has children, my parents will still be alive. That's really overwhelming. So I have strong determination to continue career activities that contribute to social production, if not economic activity, until very old age. And as everyone said, gathering our voices and community activities are very important, so I plan to continue participating with a spirit of service.\\nChae In-taek: Among today's various topics, housing problems came up as important along with medical care and direct childcare environment. Strong Mom, who majors in construction, what ideas do you have?\\nStrong Mom: My major isn't exactly construction. There are parts that need systematic improvement. First, the real problem in Korea is that community doesn't work. It takes a whole village to raise one child - there's such a saying. But since that doesn't work, I'm trying to do it even on a personal level. So I plan to create and live in community housing with a few acquaintances.\\nChae In-taek: Is this already in progress?\\nStrong Mom: Yes. It's in progress.\\nChae In-taek: How does it work?\\nStrong Mom: My husband works in that field. We build and live together. We're not rich. We pooled money that would be enough for everyone's jeonse [key money for rental housing].\\nChae In-taek: Multiple people gathering to live within one fence, one compound? Or in one house?\\nStrong Mom: About one compound. A form where we can live together while individual housing is guaranteed.\\nChae In-taek: Like the Scandinavian trend of 25 people forming one unit with young people, old people, balanced gender ratios, and various professions and economic levels creating one small neighborhood? Where those 25 people can each enjoy privacy in their homes but can cook and eat together when they come out? What I heard was quite unique - they take turns cooking.\\nStrong Mom: Yes, we plan to do that too.\\nChae In-taek: Why did you want to include cooking?\\nStrong Mom: Life centers on meals. Family [식구, literally 'those who eat together'].\\nChae In-taek: Family. Ah, to live like family, you have to eat together? And cook together too.\\nStrong Mom: We have to cook together. In the past, it was women's gender role burden to do everything, but from a community cooperation perspective, doing these things together. For children, it creates tremendous siblings, aunts and uncles. It's my way of finding a healthy way to live. Even if systems change, that's for later. That's a future problem, so I'll work on that separately and arrange my life like this.\\nChae In-taek: The nation and society should change systems so I can have more children and raise them comfortably, which is good, but will I sit and wait until then? I'll move first. Creating such community housing where like-minded people raise children together. Then, as you said so touchingly, creating numerous siblings, uncles, and aunts for our children - that's very appealing. Meanwhile, women's gender roles become unnecessary - 'Who cleaned?' 'Oh, we're doing it as a group.' That becomes possible.\\nStrong Mom: I'm interested in space. One of the many reasons Korean society became like this is that apartments were built, and eventually people with similar economic levels clustered together. In the past, everyone lived mixed together. In the same neighborhood. I think that's what space provides. And (my plan) is actually creating homes in apartments, which are the most commercially useful spaces. I think that's an important point. From a housing perspective, not just fulfilling functions but (forming community).\\nChae In-taek: Not simply space we enter to live, but communal residential space where we can live with value as humans. Very different from what we've thought before.\\nIV Mom: I'm reflecting. I'm wondering how many houses I should leave to my child. Because houses aren't something you earn to buy.\\nEasy Mom: You can't earn to buy them.\\nGood Wife: That's realistic.\\nChae In-taek: To survive, to live, to maintain current living standards - this is absolutely necessary work. We can see it that way. After a long time, we've talked about the country we want to live in, the country we want to achieve in Korea without leaving Korea, the society that's our goal for change and transformation. To summarize, it would be like this: A country for children, a country for mothers. So people won't make movies called 'There is no country for children' or 'There is no country for mothers,' we all need to work hard to change society and create communities where we help each other.

{"custom_id": "article_2", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_012F6uuNxrnHzksV9qfS5pEd", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"The Full Text of the Appeal Brief Written by 26-Year-Old Yoo Si-min That Even Judges Passed Around\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"The 191st episode of 'Ssulzeon' [a political talk show] broadcast on the 3rd, featuring a special on the Choi Soon-sil state manipulation scandal, recorded a nationwide average viewership rating of 9.287% (based on paid platforms). This is the highest rating ever for a current affairs and entertainment program on a general programming channel.\\n\\nThat day's 'Ssulzeon' achieved remarkable viewership by intensively analyzing the Choi Soon-sil gate involving President Park Geun-hye's behind-the-scenes power broker. In particular, former Minister Yoo Si-min (57) gained viewer acclaim by explaining the complexly intertwined Choi Soon-sil gate in a concise yet clear manner.\\n\\nThis has brought renewed attention to the appeal brief that former Minister Yoo wrote during his university days. Former Minister Yoo was sentenced to one year and six months in prison in 1984 for involvement in the 'Seoul National University Spy Incident' while studying economics at Seoul National University. At the time, four agents disguised as students had infiltrated Seoul National University to monitor students, and he was charged with confining and assaulting these spies.\\n\\nAppeal briefs submitted to the court are usually written by lawyers. However, former Minister Yoo wrote it himself at the recommendation of lawyer Lee Don-young, who was handling his defense.\\n\\nFormer Minister Yoo served as a member of the 16th and 17th National Assembly and as Minister of Health and Welfare under the Roh Moo-hyun administration.\\n\\nThe full text of his appeal brief, which became famous for its excellent logical development and emotionally compelling writing style and was said to be 'passed around even by judges,' is as follows.\\n\\nRegistered Address: 163 Mangseong-dong, Naenam-myeon, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\\nCurrent Address: Room 1107, Building 11, Hanyang Apartment, Siheung 1-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul\\nName: Ryu Si-min Date of Birth: July 28, 1959\\nCharge: Violation of the Act on Punishment of Violence, etc.\\n\\nI, the defendant, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for violation of the Act on Punishment of Violence, etc. by the Southern Branch of Seoul District Court on April 1, 1985, and hereby submit this appeal brief in disagreement with said sentence.\\n\\nI, the defendant, first wish to make clear that the purpose of this appeal is not to claim my innocence or to appeal the severity of the first trial sentence.\\n\\nThis appeal is merely the product of efforts to fulfill my duty as a progressive human being who yearns for a morally improved society. Moreover, I, the defendant, do not know what controversies may be contained in the first trial judgment, nor do I wish to know. This is because what I, the defendant, am concerned with as a standard for judging the legitimacy of my actions is the scale of conscience given by God, not laws made by humans.\\n\\nAs I, the defendant, lack professional knowledge of law, I have had no choice but to build my life upon the simple belief that in a society where just laws are fairly administered, conscience and law would never find themselves in a mutually hostile contradictory relationship, and this will continue to be the case in the future.\\n\\nAll acts of violence occurring between humans and between human groups are essentially both a reflection of that society's current political, social, and moral level and one of the determining factors that decide its future level.\\n\\nTherefore, I, the defendant, who was criminally prosecuted on charges of violating the \\\"Act on Punishment of Violence, etc.\\\" (hereinafter referred to as the Violence Act) and received a guilty verdict in the first trial, believe I have an obligation to clarify what political, social, and moral conditions of our society this incident I was involved in reflects, what impact it will have on future conditions, and to clearly reveal the ethical responsibilities of each individual and group related to the incident.\\n\\nIf our society can only learn the common lesson of \\\"A beat up B who beat up C. So they were punished\\\" from this unfortunate incident of young university students assaulting other young people of the same generation, that would be a greater tragedy than the incident itself.\\n\\nSimply put, this appeal brief is a petition requesting the court to give moral warnings to immoral individuals and groups, legal sanctions to those who violated the law, and the baptism of truth to citizens buried in false spirits.\\n\\nI emphasize again that since I, the defendant, am not discussing law, terms such as 'responsibility,' 'duty,' 'fault,' etc. used in this text without special modifiers should be understood as having the modifier 'ethical' or 'moral' omitted.\\n\\nI have used dots above words or sentences that I, the defendant, particularly wish to emphasize.\\n\\nI, the defendant, intend to achieve the purpose of this text by first defining this incident, then explaining it, and finally analyzing the actions taken by students and the current regime (I use the word 'regime' instead of 'government' to indicate that the Fifth Republic lacks legitimacy and legitimacy according to the basic principles of liberal democracy that I, the defendant, believe in) in relation to the incident.\\n\\nThis incident is called the 'Seoul National University Spy Incident' by students, and the 'Seoul National University Outsider Assault Incident' or simply the 'Seoul National University Lynch Incident' by the regime and mass media. This difference in incident names indicates that the two sides view the incident from completely different perspectives, but this does not mean the essence of the incident itself changes.\\n\\nIf I, the defendant, were to define this incident from as objective a standpoint as possible, it was an unexpected incident that occurred almost spontaneously when multiple Seoul National University students detained and interrogated four fake students suspected of being intelligence sources for investigative agencies, inflicting either minor or serious assault in the process, within Gwanak Campus where mutual hostile tensions between the regime and universities had escalated.\\n\\nTo explain the 'mutually hostile tension between the regime and universities,' we would need to examine the quarter-century history of student movements' anti-dictatorship democratization struggles and the intensifying history of dictatorial regime oppression of universities since the May 16 military coup that crushed the April Democratic Revolution and established the first military dictatorship on this land. However, considering that this is an appeal brief, I will limit myself to pointing out that there have been countless struggles including the anti-Japanese humiliating diplomacy struggle of 1964-65 (the so-called June 3 Incident), the People's Alliance for Democracy struggle of 1974, and the anti-dictatorship people's struggle in Busan and Masan in 1979, and will examine only the situation after December 12, 1979, when the core of the current regime was firmly formed and effectively seized power through a military coup.\\n\\nThe economic contradictions, social conflicts, political corruption, and cultural decadence of our society today all gestated and developed under the past Yushin dictatorship and have achieved even greater growth under the current regime. The current regime is a blood-stained power that emerged by trampling with military boots the hopes of the entire nation who had barely escaped the clutches of the Yushin dictatorship and were optimistic about democratic recovery, using the 'people's army' armed with taxes and defense funds paid by citizens to indiscriminately massacre Gwangju citizens who protested the May 17 atrocity.\\n\\nThe current regime is a power that was morally bankrupt even before its official launch. The 'new era' spoken of by the current regime is a new 'Yushin era' that could barely achieve formal legitimacy by painting the blatantly brutal Yushin dictatorial constitution with all kinds of fancy colors and forcing it upon the people under the threat of guns and swords. Their 'justice' means the authoritarian rule of a small military faction, and the 'welfare' they defend means the pleasure of the wealthy, including monopolistic chaebols.\\n\\nWe call the ideological tendency to abolish various 'inefficient' democratic institutions (separation of powers, political parties, labor unions, free press, free assembly and association) for 'economic growth,' i.e., capitalist development, fascism. And modern history of this century has proven that the fate of such fascist states was either large-scale war provocation that plunged all humanity into disaster and collapse due to defeat, or even in the most fortunate cases, self-destruction through internal power struggles while forcing profound political and economic bankruptcy upon their people.\\n\\nNazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militaristic Japan are representative examples of the former, while Franco's Spain, the military regimes of Chile and Argentina that emerged by overthrowing legitimate governments, the Yushin system that collapsed overnight, and the Marcos regime in the Philippines, which is now showing clear signs of collapse, are clearly examples of the latter.\\n\\nA state is precious not because it is a state, but because only it can provide conditions for all members to freely pursue happiness and self-realization without interfering with each other. Over the past several years, young university people who have stood at the forefront of labor activists fighting for minimum conditions for human life, conscientious religious people working to realize God's kingdom on earth, journalists and professors who endured hardship for truth and verity, and democratic politicians who have longed for the restoration of democratic institutions, have argued that the current military dictatorship regime, which is immoral, violent, undemocratic, and anti-people, and therefore could not survive even one week under conditions where people could freely see, hear, and speak, cannot be the representative of our precious motherland. This is because we believe our people have the qualifications and ability to have a more democratic government.\\n\\nHowever, in the four years since the December 12 military coup, the current regime has detained approximately 1,300 students on various charges, expelled approximately 1,400, and forcibly conscripted at least 500, taking them directly from police station detention cells to military barracks. Furthermore, it has perpetrated unprecedented university oppression by establishing surveillance posts in every corner of campuses, stationing plainclothes detectives permanently, and even mobilizing faculty as riot suppression forces when that wasn't enough.\\n\\nYet it has never once acknowledged these facts. Even when an incredible incident occurred in 1982 where a young female student was sexually assaulted on campus by a suspicious person claiming to be an agent, the highest security authority calmly answered a parliamentary inquiry by saying, \\\"We have never stationed police permanently on campus. We will root out and thoroughly investigate the source of these rumors.\\\"\\n\\nThe current distrust and hostility toward riot police, especially police, pervading university areas is merely one of the harmful results caused by such regime oppression of universities and habitual lies by those in power.\\n\\nThe lie of Aesop's shepherd boy only resulted in the small incident of losing sheep, but King You of Zhou's false beacon fires to please the beauty Baosi became the trigger that swept the entire Chinese continent into great warfare lasting over 500 years. However, no wise person would call the villagers who ignored the shepherd boy's cries or the feudal lords who abandoned the Zhou royal house until it was ravaged by barbarians foolish.\\n\\nWhose responsibility is the students' distrust, refusing to believe the regime's claims even if they said beans could make soybean paste? Moreover, the barbaric and immoral university oppression triggered life-risking resistance at universities nationwide, resulting in countless students losing their lives or suffering serious injuries. At Seoul National University alone, three young lives were sacrificed: the late Kim Tae-hoon, Hwang Jeong-ha, and Han Hee-cheol.\\n\\nThis situation continued almost unchanged even after the so-called autonomization measures of December 1983, except that the main battlefront moved to school gates. Intelligence agencies' university surveillance, searches and inspections at school gates, tailing and forced detention, which were particularly strengthened around the revival of student councils in September last year, caused unprecedented escalation of mutual hostility. In other words, the 'hostile tension between universities and the regime' continued even after the so-called autonomization measures.\\n\\nThis incident occurred almost spontaneously and unexpectedly under exactly these conditions when several fake students engaged in behavior that warranted suspicion as intelligence sources for investigative agencies. Since the circumstances leading to their suspicion and the course of events have already been revealed, there is no need to discuss them again, but some additional explanation about the fake students would be helpful.\\n\\nWhether they were actually intelligence sources is certainly a matter of great political interest, but it is irrelevant to the legal and ethical aspects of the incident. This is because what the students detained, confined, investigated, or assaulted were not intelligence sources or simple fake students, but 'those suspected of being intelligence sources,' so the violence itself could not be justified, nor could all the students' actions be deemed unjust simply because they were not intelligence sources.\\n\\nI, the defendant, do not revisit this issue not because I think they were not intelligence sources, but for the reason stated above.\\n\\nThese numerous fake students wandering campus disguised as students for various purposes are an anti-social human group that parasitizes on campus by exploiting the dehumanizing phenomena of atomization and isolation of university people caused by various systems devised by the dictatorial regime to transform universities into collective training centers for professional functionaries interested only in their own well-being, with paralyzed critical consciousness of social reality, in today's so-called large-scale, comprehensive universities. They are complexly related to theft, fraud, sexual assault, and auxiliary activities for university surveillance (as in Son Hyeong-gu's case) that occur daily on campus, thereby creating widespread distrust among university people and destroying the university's healthy community culture like cancer.\\n\\nThe current regime has condoned or encouraged the proliferation of fake students not only because they destroy university solidarity but also because they can shift responsibility for the numerous problems caused by stationing plainclothes police on campus (as in the female student sexual assault incident) onto them.\\n\\nTherefore, there is no need to explain the disgust students harbor toward them. When these fake students are caught engaging in information gathering activities about student activities while brazenly acting as students at small gatherings of returning students, in libraries, at the College of Law office, or in lecture halls, would it be ethically right to overlook this out of fear of the law? In such a mutually hostile atmosphere, could one possibly request identity verification of fake students suspected of being intelligence sources from the very investigative agencies presumed to have sent them?\\n\\nOf course, since university campuses are open spaces, even if hundreds or thousands of uniformed and plainclothes police were to roam the campus as in the past, not to mention covert surveillance activities, this would not be illegal at all. However, I, the defendant, have never heard anyone say such behavior is morally desirable.\\n\\nOn the other hand, any substantial resistance by students to such immoral university oppression, though ethically justified, would clearly violate current law. Here arises the inevitably mutually hostile contradictory relationship between law and conscience that could not exist in a just society. No one can uphold both law and conscience in this situation.\\n\\nThe students' claim that this incident is a concentrated expression of the political and social contradictions facing our entire society, including university society, is based on exactly this reasoning.\\n\\nLaw possesses the power to enforce itself, but conscience does not. Law is temporary and relative, but conscience is absolute and eternal. Law is made by humans, but conscience is given by God.\\n\\nSo I, the defendant, followed conscience. This was not because obeying the law was unimportant, but because following the command of conscience was more important. Not only I, the defendant, but all students did so, not only in this incident but in all previous incidents. This is how the series of incidents over ten days in September last year occurred.\\n\\nHowever, this incident, which was not very complex in itself, brought serious shockwaves including Seoul National University students' sit-in at the Democratic Party headquarters, expulsion and detention of major student council leaders, a major offensive by the regime and mass media against 'the violence of student movements,' Seoul National University's test boycott struggle and large-scale police deployment, and concluded with guilty verdicts for defendants who almost completely denied the charges.\\n\\nThe sit-in at the Democratic Party headquarters the day after the incident ended, September 28, led by Korean Student Defense Corps President Baek Tae-woong and later Fake Student Incident Response Committee Chairman and College of Social Sciences President Oh Jae-young, was intended to elevate this spontaneous, unorganized incident into an organized struggle criticizing immoral university surveillance and the regime's undemocratic nature. Even if there were legal and ethical faults by students in the process of investigating fake students, the separate political issue of the existence of university surveillance could not be covered up, so I, the defendant, think this struggle was completely justified in itself.\\n\\nThe day after this occurred, on the evening of September 29, school authorities immediately expelled four major student council leaders: Lee Jeong-woo, Baek Ki-young, Baek Tae-woong, and Oh Jae-young. I, the defendant, was forcibly detained without warrant by police on the afternoon of September 30, investigated for several days, and then imprisoned. I, the defendant, was detained first because I did not flee in advance, did not flee because I felt no need to, and felt no need because I had done nothing wrong enough to warrant fleeing.\\n\\nI, the defendant, made no revisions or reversals during police and prosecutor investigations and court testimony except for minor errors due to memory limitations, and spoke only the truth. In any case, on October 4, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Chief announced the investigation results of the so-called 'Seoul National University Outsider Assault Incident' through various newspapers, TV, and radio. According to him, this series of incidents involving the confinement and assault of four outsiders was intentionally and systematically created under the agreement of I, the defendant, who was the representative of the Returning Students Council, and student representatives.\\n\\nHowever, none of the several students (including I, the defendant) who were detained by police at least before October 4 had made statements supporting this announcement. That the detention warrants, indictments, and related students' interrogation records created afterward were all made to fit the basic line of this announcement is obvious to anyone who would examine all these documents by date.\\n\\nIn short, the essence of the October 4 police announcement is exactly that: forced interpretation, exaggeration, fabrication, and distortion for some political purpose. That purpose was nothing other than to conceal the political nature of this incident as well as the violence and immorality of the current regime itself by slandering the student movement as violence-oriented destructive activities. To achieve this purpose, this incident had to be created not spontaneously and accidentally, but systematically and intentionally by representatives of student organizations.\\n\\nOnly then could they defame not just a few related students but the entire student movement. Therefore, the Student Council President, Korean Student Defense Corps President, Fake Student Incident Response Committee Chairman, Returning Students Council representative, etc., had to become the most convenient sacrificial offerings for propaganda, regardless of what kind of person each actually was and what actions they actually took.\\n\\nOf course, this method is nothing new, merely copying the old methods that dictatorial regimes have routinely employed whenever opportunities arose over the past decades. And as a result, the current regime seems to have succeeded to some extent in practically blocking the activities of major leaders of the Seoul National University Student Council that had just launched, while simultaneously damaging the morality of the student movement that even 600,000 troops could not destroy.\\n\\nTherefore, they might even have tasted some self-satisfaction as if they had become more moral beings. The prosecution also focused more on supporting the police announcement than on revealing facts, filing charges with similar content and obsessing only with that.\\n\\nEvidence of this is the fact that in November last year, more than a month after the incident, detectives from Gwanak Police Station's investigation division extracted false confessions consistent with the charges by subjecting innocent students Kim Do-hyeong, Son Taek-man, and others to severe torture—to use the detectives' own expression.\\n\\nIn other words, police fabricated evidence that I, the defendant, and others violated the 'Violence Act' by violating that very 'Violence Act' through torturing related students. Even setting aside the fact that these fabricated false confessions were adopted as evidence, the serious issue of 'equality before the law' still remains.\\n\\nUnlike past emergency measures or the current 'Assembly and Demonstration Act,' which had no legitimate ethical foundation and therefore conscientious people need not feel obligated to obey, I think this 'Violence Act' is a law that should and can be observed.\\n\\nHowever, each individual is placed in an unequal position before this law according to their political views toward the current regime. I, the defendant, have never heard even a similar story of information division detectives at police stations near universities, who habitually assault and torture students, being criminally prosecuted for 'Violence Act' violations for such actions, though this may be due to my inadequacy.\\n\\nHowever, when Lee Kyeong-eun, wife of expelled Korea University student Seo Won-gi and herself an expelled student, miscarried her six-month-old fetus due to kicks from Dongdaemun Police Station detectives while returning home after attending a memorial service for Gwangju Uprising victims hosted by the 'Youth Coalition for Democratization Movement' on May 19 last year, it became obvious to everyone that the couple was outside the protection of this law. This is because even after accepting the complaint, the prosecution did not even begin an investigation.\\n\\nI, the defendant, have been assaulted several times during repeated detentions and investigations by investigative agencies, but have never dared to request protection under this law. Yet despite never threatening or assaulting anyone, I, the defendant, was found guilty under the Violence Act.\\n\\nI, the defendant, bring up these past events only to remind of the existence of what is commonly called prosecutorial political bias. That is, to point out that the police officers handling this case were not unrelated to the current regime's political conspiracy revealed above.\\n\\nIn conclusion, most of what the prosecution claims as charges is meant to support the incident content fabricated by police for impure political purposes. On one hand, it stands on the foundation of general prejudices widely disseminated through collusion between the regime and mass media, while on the other hand, it is supported by false confessions of related students extracted through police torture investigations and filled with hollow content.\\n\\nHowever, I, the defendant, am not loudly denouncing the regime's immorality to avoid the students' faults revealed in this incident and my own legal and ethical responsibilities. Even if detaining and investigating fake students was ethically justified, I have no intention of justifying the assault inflicted on them. Confinement for investigation should be as brief as possible, and there should be no assault.\\n\\nOf course, not everything that appears to be violence belongs to the realm of violence in essence, but assault by a group against a powerless individual, even if it was an expression of justified hostility toward police and imitated the torture they habitually inflicted on students, must be judged as clearly deviating from the student movement's non-violence principle.\\n\\nAlso, that the perpetrators of assault did not step forward to take responsibility themselves, even considering the special political circumstances that made this difficult at the time, I think represents an expression of ethical defects among students.\\n\\nHowever, I, the defendant, am confident that the beautiful act of Student Council President Lee Jeong-woo, who was absolutely unrelated to assault and had nothing to do with the entire incident, taking all responsibility upon himself and even giving up appeal, filled to some extent the ethical vacuum created by no one readily taking responsibility for the assault.\\n\\nAlthough I, the defendant, also never gave verbal instructions or directed investigations (because there was no need to give instructions), if it had been necessary, I would have gladly detained and investigated them directly at any time (though I well know this would be illegal).\\n\\nAs the de facto representative of the Returning Students Council, I, the defendant, was in a position where I had to fulfill not only the passive duty of personally adhering to non-violence principles but also the active duty of ensuring this principle was implemented at the overall level of the student movement.\\n\\nTherefore, I, the defendant, certainly bear greater ethical responsibility than other students for briefly witnessing Jeon Gi-dong and Jeong Yong-beom being beaten on the night of September 26 and not trying to stop it (though I don't know about the legal aspect).\\n\\nAlso, in the cases of Lim Sin-hyeon and Son Hyeong-gu, when I, the defendant, became involved in the incident, confinement and investigation were already in progress, so there was no need to give any instructions.\\n\\nHowever, since I, the defendant, clearly agreed to confinement for investigation and even directly participated in investigation briefly, it is certain that I violated the law, and I will gladly accept the resulting responsibility. However, in the case of these two people, I did my best to implement the principles of confinement as brief as possible and non-violence, and these principles were actually implemented, so I, the defendant, feel no ethical responsibility.\\n\\nIn any case, I could have acted like Lee Jeong-woo to take on the considerable legal and ethical responsibility that was mine, and I believe that would also have been good. However, as already revealed, because of the possibility of becoming a plaything of the regime's all-too-obvious conspiracy, I, the defendant, resolved never to acknowledge anything contrary to facts, no matter how trivial, and have approached the legal struggle with this attitude.\\n\\nOnly then can I, the defendant, show that the responsibility I feel is fundamentally different in nature from what is demanded through high-handed tactics to establish the charges as established facts.\\n\\nFurthermore, I, the defendant, wish to tell you what political significance this trial holds and that the judiciary must fulfill its inherent ethical duties if this incident is to become an opportunity for moral progress in our society.\\n\\nThis incident occurred against the background of accumulated distrust and hostility between the regime and universities, when several fake students' information gathering activities—not entirely illegal but clearly immoral—triggered students' response actions that were not essentially immoral but clearly illegal.\\n\\nThe various immoral acts shown by the current regime over the past several years—the behavior of security authorities who stationed hundreds of police on campuses while giving false testimony to the entire nation, the behavior of investigative agencies that continued covert university surveillance under the beautiful signboard of so-called autonomization measures (this was revealed in detail in court), the behavior of fabricating and distorting even this incident for impure political purposes—are merely different branches growing from the same root.\\n\\nHowever, this trial is not meant to identify the true causes of the incident and prescribe treatment for them, but to punish only the illegal aspects of students' actions. Perhaps the judiciary itself may not intend to defend such immoral regime intrusion into universities. However, the first trial judgment that defined even detention for investigation (not the assault part) as subject to criminal punishment while completely ignoring the context before and after the situation cannot be called anything other than a 'Declaration of Safety Guarantee for Fake Students and Intelligence Sources' that guaranteed the personal safety of numerous fake students and intelligence sources who may still be wandering campuses for various anti-social purposes at this very moment.\\n\\nI, the defendant, by no means demand acquittal for all students' actions. As repeatedly stated, moral warnings should be given to the immoral alongside legal sanctions for law violators, and citizens buried in false propaganda should receive the baptism of truth. Only by clarifying responsibility for the situation can moral improvement for all of us be expected.\\n\\nCourts are sacred not because they are courts, but because only there can we tear away the beautiful masks of falsehood and meet the true face of truth, even if it sometimes appears ugly.\\n\\nIf today's judiciary upholds justice even if the sky falls, and if that justice does not mean the rule of the strong, I, the defendant, believe that the truth buried in the first trial process should be able to receive life again. Otherwise, we will probably see anger's thorny vines added to the already high barriers of current distrust and hostility that are not easily dismantled due to this incident, and we will inevitably encounter similar situations that will explode in even more violent forms someday.\\n\\nOver the past five years, approximately 1,500 prisoners of conscience imprisoned on various charges for opposing the current regime were all found guilty by righteous judges in this 'sacred court' without exception. Even under the brutal Yushin dictatorship, just as many people were imprisoned for not observing the unprecedented evil law of 'emergency measures.' Reporting on emergency measure violations was also a violation of emergency measures, so no one could even speak of it. Lawyers making arguments were also detained for those arguments.\\n\\nNow few claim emergency measures were righteous laws, and few say those imprisoned then were 'anti-social undesirable elements' or 'treasonous actors,' but the courts that made them 'criminals' are still called 'sacred,' and the prosecutors and judges who indicted and found them guilty are still said to work for 'realizing justice.'\\n\\nIf someone says \\\"Korea's judiciary has turned away from justice until now,\\\" that would mean \\\"courts have been used as execution grounds for democracy.\\\" If someone says \\\"Korea's judiciary has upheld justice until now,\\\" and if he is truly a serious person, he must be someone who firmly believes \\\"justice is the will of dictators.\\\"\\n\\nI, the defendant, want to be tried in a sacred court not because it reeks of blood shed when democracy was murdered there, but in the sense that only there can we meet the true face of truth.\\n\\nI, the defendant, earnestly hope that the judge who finds me guilty will be a wise judge who 'upholds justice even if the sky falls,' not someone who 'is interested in justice only within limits that do not shake his position.'\\n\\nAnd I believe that revealing truth is building the foundation on which justice can stand.\\n\\nBased on the above discussion, I, the defendant, wish to briefly mention why I cannot accept the first trial judgment. When I, the defendant, received the judgment document, I could not help feeling truly sorrowful. This is because it was almost unrelated to the incident content revealed through seven court sessions.\\n\\nTherefore, I, the defendant, belatedly realized that the entire trial process I had approached so seriously was nothing more than worthless formality conducted to plausibly decorate a predetermined judgment.\\n\\nFirst, the part in 'Criminal Facts' Item 1 of the 'Judgment Reasons' stating \\\"...witnessing Lim Sin-hyeon being...beaten, defendant Yoo Si-min had unidentified students verify and investigate the identity of said Lim Sin-hyeon...\\\" could not be established even in terms of formal logic.\\n\\nIf the existence of a student who actually received instructions from I, the defendant, was proven, how could he be unidentified? And since I, the defendant, never once acknowledged this, and even relying entirely on testimonies of various students including Baek Su-taek and Lim Sin-hyeon's own court testimony, it would be impossible to prove that I, the defendant, was at the scene where Lim Sin-hyeon was detained and beaten, let alone how could it be proven that I, the defendant, gave some instructions to someone unidentified?\\n\\nIn fact, I, the defendant, was not there at that time.\\n\\nNext, the part in 'Criminal Facts' Item 2 stating \\\"...said Kim Do-in beat [Son Hyeong-gu] in front of defendants Baek Tae-woong and Yoo Si-min...causing multiple contusions requiring three weeks of treatment...\\\" also contradicts even Son Hyeong-gu's own court testimony that he was \\\"never once assaulted while being investigated by Baek Tae-woong and Yoo Si-min.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the part in 'Criminal Facts' Item 3 stating \\\"defendant Yoo Si-min...from 21:00 on the same day [September 26] until 01:00 the next day, together with defendants Yoon Ho-jung, Oh Jae-young, and Baek Ki-young, Nam Seung-woo, Oh Seung-jung, Ahn Seung-yoon, etc....resolved to continue investigating [Jeong Yong-beom]...\\\" and similar passages in 'Criminal Facts' Item 4 are merely distortions of the fact that I, the defendant, had lengthy discussions with election management committee members about ongoing student council presidential election management and problems with student council regulations, as clearly revealed by testimonies of Oh Seung-jung, Kim Do-hyeong, and others.\\n\\nThese few examples merely point out particularly egregious factual discrepancies, and needless to say, the entire judgment contains countless similar contradictions that are difficult to enumerate.\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon reflecting the regime's intention to make the entire incident appear to have proceeded intentionally under the command of I, the defendant, and student representatives. Most of the judgment content is evidence that it was copied word for word through detention warrants and indictments from the October 4 police announcement that was exaggerated, forced, fabricated, and distorted as the original text, without changing even a syllable.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I must judge that the first trial judgment completely abandoned the judiciary's social duty to contribute to our entire society's moral improvement by clarifying the ethical and legal responsibilities of each individual and group related to the incident.\\n\\nI emphasize again that I, the defendant, point out the injustice of the first trial judgment not to avoid my responsibility but because I want a guilty verdict based on valid reasons.\\n\\nFinally, I, the defendant, who has now become an example of a 'violent extremist student,' would like to make a few words of excuse for myself in place of concluding this appeal brief. This is because I, the defendant, am by no means more passionate than others or someone who likes to show off, and certainly not a young person with red ideology or who worships violence.\\n\\nI, the defendant, am nothing more than the most ordinary young man commonly seen on the streets, a rather straightforward young person who considers the words of elementary school teachers whose names I can no longer remember—\\\"Do not pass by when you see injustice,\\\" \\\"Think of your neighbor's pain as your own pain,\\\" \\\"Do not lie\\\"—as unchanging truths.\\n\\nThrough this excuse, I, the defendant, wish to defend the entire struggle of students demanding the revival of democracy—the act of practicing the purest love, practicing infinite love for the motherland.\\n\\nWhen I left for Seoul to study seven years ago in late February 1978, carrying a large bundle and feeling my mother's proud gaze from the village entrance behind me, I, the defendant, was merely a nineteen-year-old country boy who had not yet shed his childishness and aspired to become a judge (because I thought this was a way to repay parents who had turned away from good clothes and delicious food all their lives to raise six children, and because I was convinced this was not bad work).\\n\\nAt that time, when I could only hear warm words of blessing from everyone, I, the defendant, as a Seoul National University social sciences freshman, truly did not know that the phrase 'Yushin system' was mixed with the smell of blood and prison. The social studies teacher's words that \\\"Yushin is the only way to live\\\" could not be lies. Today was always only sweet, and the future I thrilled to think about was wrapped only in rosy hope.\\n\\nBut on some May day when azaleas had already withered but acacia flowers had not yet bloomed, under dazzlingly bright sunlight on a campus that was only growing greener, I saw through the stinging tear gas I was tasting for the first time and unstoppable tears the figure of a frail female student being dragged away by her hair, while I hid in a remote corner of the student hall with my frightened heart clenched.\\n\\nFrom that day, all things began to approach with slightly different meanings. The unsightly bare white patch of grass in front of the dormitory entrance observation deck, worn away by combat police stationed on campus playing baseball daily, became a festering wound in my chest that stung whenever I remembered it.\\n\\nI became ashamed that our monthly boarding fees were more than a sixteen-year-old girl earned working more than 60 hours per week. Even while drinking beer or on blind dates with pretty female students, I increasingly found my face burning as if I were a child caught doing something wrong. These phenomena must have been signs of becoming a 'problem student.'\\n\\nAnd that winter, after seeing beloved seniors come out as criminals from 'sacred courts,' I seriously considered and eventually erased from my mind the image of myself sitting in a high seat wearing judicial robes. The next summer, I, the defendant, was elected as economics department representative, thereby finally receiving official recognition as a problem student from school authorities and investigative agencies, and when there were demonstrations, I came to throw stones at the front.\\n\\nAnd after the October 26 incident when the Yushin regime, frightened by the people's growing anti-dictatorship struggle, collapsed due to internal strife, I participated in the student council revival movement to liquidate the nightmarish two years of university life under Yushin rule and took on the important position of 'Student Council Representative Assembly Chairman' in March 1980.\\n\\nOn May 17, when that unforgettable spring struggle was frustrated, I, the defendant, suddenly became a detained student and received harsh treatment for two months from Presidential Security Service military police who boasted of 'beating up professors and priests' and National Police Agency special investigators who were later the perpetrators of the 'Kim Geun-jo torture murder case' in Busan, before being forced to give false testimony that Kim Dae-jung had distributed funds to various university student council presidents.\\n\\nReleased three months after detention through a military court's dismissal decision without understanding why, I was irregularly conscripted just 40 hours after a physical examination a few days later, thus becoming a 'forcibly conscripted student.' On the eve of enlistment, having my head shaved at a barbershop in an unfamiliar town, I, the defendant, realized that being alive was no longer a blessing but a disgrace.\\n\\nFrom that day until discharge, for 32 months and one day, I, the defendant, came to have the new name 'special status change person' and had to be permanently blocked from all positions except rifleman in a frontline rifle company as a constant surveillance target.\\n\\nAnd before I could even get used to life with only minus 20-degree cold, merciless barbed wire cutting through mountainsides, and stars in the night sky as companions, in late that year when I, the defendant, was still a private, I was implicated in a leaflet case involving university friends, spent a month going between Seoul Defense Security Command branch offices and regional security units, underwent detailed re-investigation of my entire university life, and could only return to my unit after writing an insincere reflection stating my ideology had become left-leaning, while simultaneously being transferred to another regiment.\\n\\nHowever, I, the defendant, consider it great fortune that I could spend three years at the frontline of the central-eastern front, the site of our nation's division tragedy, specifically in a rifle company that is the backbone of our military, and take pride in having been an excellent soldier second to none.\\n\\nBut another trial awaited just two months before discharge in March 1983. This was the 'greening project' or 'controlled spy operations' that shocked the world last year. The most inhumane form of oppression was applied to hundreds of special status change persons, forcing humans to sell out friends for personal safety.\\n\\nI, the defendant, as an active soldier at the time, was unable to overcome fear of the security units and could secure personal safety through the compromise of formally responding to their demands, but the torment of conscience was unavoidable. The shocking incident where six fellow students who were forcibly conscripted like I, the defendant, died mysteriously or took their own lives in connection with the greening project revived new will for life and struggle in I, the defendant, who had been crushed by fear of the military dictatorship regime's violent oppression.\\n\\nFaced with the pure conscience's declaration of those who chose death rather than betray comrades, I, the defendant, could not continue being ashamed of my cowardice forever. That would be an insult to their pure spirits. Therefore, taking advantage of the December 1983 readmission measures for expelled students, I, the defendant, formed the 'Expelled Students Readmission Promotion Committee' with friends and struggled without readmission, demanding abolition of this barbaric forced conscription and greening project and true university democratization.\\n\\nEven then, the regime denied the existence of the greening project—indeed, even the existence of forced conscription—while using the truly rare term 'a tiny number of left-wing extremist expelled students who ignore readmission and use the government's benevolent grace as material for political agitation' and launching a large-scale propaganda offensive mobilizing regime-friendly media.\\n\\nWhen I was readmitted last September due to various circumstances, I, the defendant, organized the 'Returning Students Council' according to my conviction that 'the struggle for democratization must continue anytime, anywhere, in any form.'\\n\\nHowever, just two weeks after readmission, I became an expelled and detained student again due to this incident, and my name became synonymous with 'violent student.'\\n\\nThus I, the defendant, became the first person to be expelled twice since the May 17 atrocity and the first to be detained and indicted since the so-called autonomization measures, receiving a guilty verdict for violating the 'Violence Act' and becoming a 'violent extremist student.'\\n\\nHowever, I, the defendant, still do not doubt that my hands were never used for violence and that I remain a person of gentle character. Therefore, except for the one heartbreaking fact that my aged mother grieves over her son's ordeal and sheds tears in a corner of this dreary courtroom and beneath the long walls of the detention center, though my body is confined in a 0.7-pyeong [approximately 2.3 square meter] solitary cell, my heart is always peaceful and happy.\\n\\nThat the nineteen-year-old boy whose heart fluttered at thoughts of a bright future has come to be criticized like an unforgivable thug seven years later is not because the gentle boy grew into a brutal young man, but because this era is an unjust era that 'creates the most fervent fighters from among the most gentle humans.'\\n\\nThe life journey I, the defendant, have traveled over the past seven years is not a special exception but a universal experience shared by all students of this era.\\n\\nIn light of the 'faith in democracy' that I, the defendant, share with all conscience of this era, I am convinced that the student movement demanding restoration of democratic institutions by resisting the military dictatorship regime that has neither legitimacy nor efficiency is the dawn bell that awakens the paralyzed spirit of the oppressed people.\\n\\nToday is the day when the torch of the great Gwangju people's uprising that bravely fought against military dictatorship burned its last, the very day when my friend and comrade, martyr Kim Tae-hoon, fell like flower petals after staining the gray steps of the Acropolis with pure blood, and the day Buddha came to this world to save suffering humanity.\\n\\nOn this sacred day, commemorating the countless spirits who devoted themselves to the struggle for human liberation, I pray that this text, written with small but sincere effort, will contribute even a little to revealing hidden truth.\\n\\nI, the defendant, who loves my country even more because it is full of contradictions, wish to end this humble monologue with Nekrasov's verse, a maxim valid anytime and anywhere in an era of rampant injustice: \\\"Those who live without sorrow or anger do not love their motherland.\\\"\\n\\nMay 27, 1985\\nName: Ryu Si-min\\nTo the Honorable Presiding Judge of the 5th Criminal Appeals Division, Seoul District Court\\n\\nReporter Esther etoile@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 23936, "output_tokens": 10328, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It's not difficult to find 'essay-writing exam hagwon' signs in most hagwon districts. Media companies sensitive to trends have also jumped in.\\n\\nFollowing media outlets like <Chosun Ilbo> and <Hankook Ilbo> establishing essay-writing academies outright, essay-writing exam hagwons opened by former journalists are also thriving in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]. Since mathematical essay-writing and language essay-writing appeared in the 2007 early admission system, math hagwons and social studies hagwons have also been changing their signs to 'essay-writing exam hagwons' and jumping into the essay-writing market.\\n\\nAccording to a report released by Daewoo Securities last April, the domestic hagwon education market size is 16.8 trillion won [approximately $12.6 billion USD]. Experts believe about half of this flows into the essay-writing market. Large essay-writing exam hagwons have annual revenues exceeding 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD].\\n\\nThe essay-writing fever swept through hagwon districts nationwide last year. The trigger was the Ministry of Education's announcement in early last year of the 2008 university admission system, which centered on the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) changing to a grade system while increasing the weight of school records and essay-writing exams.\\n\\nThe essay-writing market, which only the top 3-5% of students aiming for Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University used to prepare for, expanded into a giant market where 30-50% of test-takers, or more broadly, students from elementary school onwards, must prepare. Particularly when major universities with deep distrust of school records announced as a follow-up to the Ministry of Education's announcement that they would change essay-writing exams to integrated subject format starting from the 2008 academic year, the essay-writing market truly 'exploded.'\\n\\n**01 Why Are Elite Instructors Flocking to the Essay-Writing Industry?**\\n*Rapid expansion from top 3-5% market to 30-50% market*\\n\\nDemand for essay-writing courses has existed steadily since major universities revived comprehensive exams in 1994. This was because while university-specific English and math comprehensive exams were banned starting from the 1997 admissions, essay-writing exams were permitted. Accordingly, an essay-writing hagwon boom had already begun in the Daechi-dong area from the early 2000s. This was thanks to 'Daechi-dong ajummas' [middle-class mothers in the affluent Daechi-dong area known for their intense focus on their children's education] who early on grasped that essay-writing was key to getting into major universities.\\n\\nThe person who pioneered the blue ocean of the essay-writing market in the Daechi-dong hagwon district was the late Cho Jin-man, former vice president of Megastudy. He became a 'pinpoint instructor [a teacher known for accurately predicting exam questions]' overnight after correctly predicting 6 out of 6 essay-writing problems from 4 universities - Yonsei, Sogang, Hanyang, and Ewha - in the 1996 university admissions. He died of overwork in September 2001 at age 32, having been too busy with lectures to even visit the hospital after contracting pneumonia.\\n\\nThe first generation of essay-writing instructors includes, besides instructor Cho Jin-man, Lee Seok-rok (Megastudy evaluation director), Lee Man-gi (Uway Central Education evaluation director), and Cho Dong-gi (director of Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Specialist Hagwon). Most of these were instructors who had taught Korean language and expanded their scope to include essay-writing.\\n\\nAt that time, since only some universities administered essay-writing exams, language instructors would teach mainly language subjects until just before the CSAT, then focus on essay-writing lectures after the CSAT ended.\\n\\nHagwon instructors began jumping into the essay-writing market in earnest after 2000, when early admission systems became full-fledged. Around this time, it became possible to 'do business' for a full year with essay-writing lectures alone.\\n\\nFollowing first-generation essay-writing instructors represented by Cho Jin-man, Lee Seok-rok, and Lee Man-gi, the second-generation instructors who currently move the essay-writing hagwon scene include Park Hak-cheon and Yoon Seong-jin (Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon), Lee Yun-ho and Song Jae-hui (Choam C&C), Jang Min-seong, Park Su-rim, and Park Hong-soon (Eureka Essay-Writing Academy), and Kim Jae-in (Uway Central Education OK Logic Essay-Writing representative instructor).\\n\\nThese instructors also began their activities around the same time as first-generation instructors, but having focused on the single field of essay-writing for the past 10 years, they are now enjoying their heyday. Unlike first-generation powerhouses who competed based on individual star instructor capabilities, second-generation powerhouses are characterized by operating centered on teams or hagwons with established systems. Regarding this, Ahn In-sook, assistant director of Apgujeong Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon, explains:\\n\\n\\\"Usually, star instructors have meant 'pinpoint instructors' until now. Instructor Cho Jin-man, who correctly predicted problems from 4 universities in the 1996 admissions, is a representative example. However, in current essay-writing trends, being a 'pinpoint instructor' is impossible and meaningless. This became even more impossible with the introduction of integrated essay-writing exams. Ultimately, since one instructor cannot handle everything, which hagwon has a well-established system has become key.\\\"\\n\\nWhat's interesting is that the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] essay-writing market has been dominated by hagwons created by people from the 386 generation [Koreans born in the 1960s who were politically active in the 1980s democracy movement] student movement background.\\n\\n**02 Korea University Student Movement Gathering Place 'Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon'**\\n*Started to help juniors make a living, became corporate-type with 28 directly managed branches...*\\n\\nThe instructor who started as a first-generation Korean language instructor and has maintained a firm position in the essay-writing market to this day is Cho Dong-gi, director of Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Specialist Hagwon. Director Cho, class of '85, is from the so-called 386 student movement background, having served as executive chairman of Korea University's student council.\\n\\nHe was also deeply involved in theater, active as a member of Korea University's theater club 'Geukoe.' His entry into the hagwon market was also to raise money for office relocation costs for 'Seoul Film Collective,' which he joined to make independent films after university graduation.\\n\\nWith handsome looks and voice that once made him dream of being a film actor, he quickly became a popular instructor. Starting as a part-time instructor at a small supplementary hagwon in Asia Athletes' Village, he became a representative instructor at Gangnam Daeil Hagwon in just 5 years by 1994.\\n\\nDirector Cho summarizes his success formula as follows:\\n\\n\\\"Basically, CSAT language subjects and essay-writing subjects match well with student movement backgrounds. Particularly, student movement people systematically studied classics and humanities/social sciences through countless seminars and discussions during university life. In my case, I also learned artistic trends through theater club activities. Since I studied most of the passages that appear in CSAT language subjects in their original texts, they had to be easy for me. Among my university classmates, I'm probably the person who best utilizes what I studied in university.\\\"\\n\\nRising to the ranks of top star instructors in Gangnam alongside Son Ju-eun in social studies subjects and Lee Beom in science subjects in the late 1990s, he handed over Gangnam Daeil Hagwon, which he had practically created, to Son Ju-eun, now Megastudy CEO, in 1998. He then established Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Specialist Hagwon with Lee Chang-gi (pen name Hong Chi-san), known as the 'foolish class president,' and became independent. CEO Son Ju-eun, who acquired Gangnam Daeil Hagwon from Director Cho, developed it into today's Megastudy.\\n\\nRegarding rumors that \\\"Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon has many Korea University student movement instructors because the director is from Korea University student movement background,\\\" Director Cho says it's \\\"a matter of how you define student movement\\\" and \\\"the 1980s was a time when everyone had to grow up fighting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Student movement people who were expelled from university or had prison experience during their university years didn't have many places to go after graduation. Such juniors came to me often asking me to introduce them to hagwons I knew, since I was somewhat famous in the hagwon scene. Among them, rather than sending good juniors to other hagwons, I held onto them to work together at our hagwon. As a result, it's true that there are many instructors from Korea University 'Geukoe' background.\\\" (laughs)\\n\\nHe adds that \\\"Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon becoming a corporate-type hagwon with 28 directly managed branches wasn't initially intended, but the business naturally expanded in the process of providing a foundation for juniors to make a living.\\\"\\n\\n**\\\"Eventually gave up dream of entering film industry\\\"**\\n\\n\\\"I planned to quit the hagwon at age 40 and return to the film industry. So I started preparing 5 years ago. I began establishing a system so the hagwon could operate without any problems even without me. In that process, I brought in many juniors. But once the system was established, an idle personnel problem arose.\\n\\nWhat I created to solve the surplus personnel problem was the Bundang branch that opened in 2002 and the Mok-dong branch that opened in 2004. At our hagwon, we give hagwon shares to instructors who have been with us for more than 3 years.\\n\\nCho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon isn't my personal property but a structure where instructors jointly own shares. For instructors with shares who want independence, we open directly managed branches for them. That's how we grew like this. If I had tried to prosper alone, we wouldn't have grown this much.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, at the end of this statement, he said he \\\"gave up the path of film acting four months ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As the hagwon expanded, the name Cho Dong-gi became quite burdensome. Students who come to our hagwon obviously come looking at the name Cho Dong-gi. But if Cho Dong-gi isn't at the hagwon and is acting in films, the hagwon's market credibility would naturally decline.\\n\\nWhen opening an internet video site, I removed Cho Dong-gi from the site name and called it '1st Period.' The strategy was to carry both brands together for a while. From what I've observed so far, 'Cho Dong-gi' still works better than '1st Period.' In this situation, I can't abandon 300 instructors and staff who trusted and followed me just to fulfill my personal dream. So I tearfully gave up my dream.\\\"\\n\\nInstead of giving up his acting dream, he decided to grow Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Specialist Hagwon even more solidly. Following opening a directly managed branch in Beijing last April, he plans to open 2 more branches in China and 1 each in the UK and Canada within this year. While the UK and Canada branches will target Korean students studying abroad locally, in China he plans to also open classes teaching Korean to local Chinese people.\\n\\n**03 'Choam' Established by Culture and Alternative Education Movement Activists**\\n*Conceived essay-writing hagwon as method of social participation... Strong cultural community character*\\n\\nAmong second-generation instructors, Lee Yun-ho, CEO of Choam C&C, was the first to jump into the essay-writing market. Class of '81, he was a student and cultural movement activist who had such a passionate university life that he transferred universities three times. CEO Lee's entry into the hagwon market was also to raise money to create the cultural criticism magazine <Review>.\\n\\nCEO Lee established Serim Supplementary Hagwon, the precursor to Choam Essay-Writing Hagwon, in Siheung in 1994 together with colleague Song Jae-hui, with whom he had worked at Seoul Workers' Union and other organizations. It was a neighborhood supplementary hagwon located in a corner of a traditional market where there were only 3 schools nearby.\\n\\n\\\"Siheung is the most remote area in Seoul. It's culturally barren. We opened a hagwon in a traditional market alley, and in the first year we had exactly 3 students total for elementary and middle school divisions. The next year, 1995, 87 students who were high school sophomores at the time enrolled, and we finally had the framework of a hagwon.\\\"\\n\\nSo says CEO Lee. Having established himself somewhat in Siheung, he moved the hagwon to Bangbae-dong in 1999. At this time, he changed the sign to Choam Essay-Writing Hagwon and began walking the path of a full-fledged essay-writing specialist hagwon. However, CEO Lee says \\\"the hagwon we wanted to create wasn't exactly a writing hagwon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The idea was to try proper youth education for once. We thought of the hagwon as a method of social participation while creating a cultural criticism magazine. We wanted to teach young people how to properly enjoy culture.\\n\\nInstructor Song Jae-hui, an early member, is also someone who created 'Haja,' a youth job experience center, together with Professor Cho Han Hye-jeong of Yonsei University. Therefore, around 1997-98 when we were moving from Siheung to Bangbae-dong, we had much internal discussion about whether to open a hagwon or establish an alternative school.\\n\\nThe conclusion was that rather than an alternative school that could become our own sanctuary, a hagwon would be better for targeting ordinary students living within the institutional education system. What we wanted to do was provide proper education to students alienated from their labor - that is, studying.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee continues his explanation. During the Bangbae-dong period, Choam was more like a kind of community than a hagwon.\\n\\n**Warm Bangbae-dong community period was the foundation**\\n\\n\\\"Even after students entered university, they created a group called 'Areumaari' among themselves and came to the hagwon on weekends. They also provided free tutoring to hagwon juniors. Students came to the hagwon and stayed even on days without classes. During exams, they gathered to study together, and after exams ended, they would stay up all night discussing among themselves before leaving... Parents also created a group called 'Mosim-hoe' and brought rice cakes to the hagwon during exam periods.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee calls it \\\"such a warm period\\\" and says \\\"today's Choam image was created during the Bangbae-dong period.\\\" The instructors at that time who can be considered Choam's founding members were Song Jae-hui, Lee Jae-ryun, Seong Min-gi, Han Sa-young, and Han Gyeong-rok. Music critic Kang Hyeon, cultural critic Professor Seo Yeong-chae of Hanshin University, and Professor Kwon Seong-wu of Sookmyung Women's University - people who had engaged in cultural movements with CEO Lee - also participated as regular essay-writing instructors.\\n\\nHowever, Choam's Bangbae-dong period didn't last even a year. They were evicted because the hagwon building was taken over by a pyramid organization. Afterward, Choam maintained a 'hagwon without a hagwon' format for about a year, with only instructors but no hagwon building. Choam instructors created an instructor network called 'Choam Network' and opened classes bearing the Choam name at other hagwons like Hak-rim Hagwon, Cheongsan Hagwon, and Daechi A+ Hagwon.\\n\\n\\\"Around the time we were evicted from Bangbae-dong, we had many concerns that 'the moment our educational institution becomes a hagwon, passion drops and children start to look like money.' We thought not establishing a hagwon was one way to preserve children's value.\\\"\\n\\nChoam ended its wandering life and reopened in Mok-dong, Seoul in 2001. Again, it started as a small hagwon with 4 classrooms.\\n\\n\\\"The jackpot came the next year, 2002. Somehow, 1,200 students flocked during the year-end admissions season. It exploded suddenly. Work was paralyzed. We turned most away and took about 600 students into admissions.\\\"\\n\\nRumors spread that most of Choam's students had entered prestigious universities, causing students to flock in explosively. Based on the 2002 success in Mok-dong, Choam entered the Daechi-dong hagwon district the following year and achieved success in Daechi-dong as well, building today's reputation. Currently, Choam operates 4 directly managed hagwons in Mok-dong, Daechi, Banpo, and Nowon, with 160 instructors alone. Collaborative hagwons that receive Choam content number 56.\\n\\n**04 Labor Movement Activists' Gathering 'Eureka'**\\n*Formed teams for year-end essay-writing season lectures... Classical reading classes worked, built reputation*\\n\\nJang Min-seong (Seoul National University class of '84) and Park Hong-soon (Sungkyunkwan University class of '82), representative instructors of Eureka Essay-Writing Academy, are from the 386 student movement background classified as South Korean Socialist Workers' Alliance (Saronmaeng). Early member Lee Hae-ung (Hankuk University of Foreign Studies class of '85), now a director, also served as student council vice president in 1988 and lived in hiding for 3 years after being wanted in the 1992 Free Democratic Unification (Jamintong) incident.\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-ung says \\\"entering the hagwon world was purely because the path to making a living was blocked.\\\" Representative instructor Jang Min-seong of Eureka first began essay-writing lectures in 1996 at Cheongsan Hagwon, a representative large hagwon in Gangdong. Initially, it was small-scale lectures targeting students aiming for Seoul National University admission.\\n\\n\\\"Essay-writing lectures require correction, so they're very labor-intensive. So I gradually brought in colleagues and juniors I knew, and the team that gathered like this created today's Eureka: Park Hong-soon, Lim Seung-cheol (class of '82), Park Gyu-hwan (lecture name Park Su-rim, class of '86), and Chae Gi-seok (class of '89).\\\"\\n\\nThey entered Daechi-dong in 1998. As students who crossed all the way to Gangbuk to hear the Jang Min-seong team's reputation increased, they decided to enter Daechi-dong altogether. Even after entering Daechi-dong, for a while they didn't directly open a hagwon but taught at other hagwons.\\n\\nAt that time, essay-writing classes were mostly taken briefly by students aiming for top Seoul universities after the CSAT ended. In other words, it was a market that briefly flourished only at year-end, so keeping a hagwon open all year didn't balance out financially.\\n\\nThus, Eureka members usually engaged in their 'main work' at local unions and civic organizations, then formed teams for essay-writing lectures at year-end. They began jumping into the essay-writing market in earnest and establishing today's organizational framework between 1998-2000. As admission formats changed every year, essay-writing gradually emerged as an important selection factor.\\n\\nEureka's ability to build reputation in Daechi-dong was greatly helped by outstanding performance by Eureka students in the Logic and Essay-Writing Competition hosted by Seoul National University. In the early 2000s, winning the Seoul National University-hosted competition meant admission to Seoul National University's early admission system. During this period, the image was created that \\\"to get into Seoul National University, you must go to Eureka.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-ung explains Eureka's success formula as \\\"classical reading-centered classes worked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eureka has conducted classes focused on reading classical original texts from the beginning. Usually centered on 30-50 classics. It's a program that's neither fun nor easy for students to follow. Many students give up within 3 months. However, because we teach the essence of essay-writing exams, Eureka students have strong adaptability even when essay-writing formats change.\\\"\\n\\n**05 'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon' Created by Dismissed Professor**\\n*Former literature critic who focused on educational publishing business, then switched to essay-writing*\\n\\n'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon' CEO Park Hak-cheon, who owns 1,600 franchise hagwons, is counted as having an unusual background in the hagwon world - a former professor. A Seoul National University education graduate, he worked as a teacher at Muhak Girls' Middle School and Seoul National University of Education Affiliated Middle School while also debuting as a literature critic. He's an unusual career holder who published over 30 critiques in <Literary Thought>, <Practical Literature>, <Hangil Literature>, <Literature and Society>, and <Literature and Criticism>.\\n\\nAfter earning Korea's first doctoral degree in Korean language education from Seoul National University in 1990, he was appointed as a full-time professor in the Korean language education department at Jeonju University but was dismissed in 1992 for trying to form a faculty council. He moved to Hansaem Publishing and transformed into an educational publisher, serving as editorial director of <Reading and Logic>. During this period, he developed <Hansaem CSAT Gold Series> and recorded 5 billion won [approximately $3.75 million USD] in profits.\\n\\nCEO Park's entry into the hagwon market in 1998 was triggered by the opening of 'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Research Institute,' established through joint investment by about 60 fellow professors, teachers, and writers to write books.\\n\\nPark Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Academy is the reverse of recent cases where Choam and Eureka started as hagwons and are trying to enter the educational publishing industry - it started in educational publishing and jumped into the hagwon business. Representative instructor Yoon Seong-jin of this hagwon says, \\\"Even when we opened an office in Yeoksam-dong, we never imagined we'd enter the hagwon market.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Initially, it was literally a research institute for writing. The office didn't even have a lecture room. But many people saw the 'Essay-Writing Research Institute' sign and came thinking it was an essay-writing hagwon. We also thought that directly teaching students would probably help with writing, so we rented 2 lecture rooms in Gangnam and Seocho-dong and began classes for the students who had specifically sought us out.\\\"\\n\\nHe says \\\"until now, we've focused more on the educational publishing industry than hagwons\\\" and \\\"we operated the hagwon until last year at a level where researchers could proceed without being disturbed in their research. Even now, we only have 4 directly managed hagwons. In the hagwon market, we're actually latecomers compared to Choam or Eureka.\\\"\\n\\n**06 Why 386 Student Movement People?**\\n*Different from expensive private tutoring... Engaged in mass education, not hagwon education*\\n\\nWhat enabled the 386 student movement to dominate the Gangnam essay-writing market - a world of 'war of all against all,' where the logic of survival of the fittest more brutal than the jungle rules?\\n\\nInstructor Choi Gyu-yun of Apgujeong Cho Dong-gi Essay-Writing Hagwon says \\\"the 386 generation is a generation that established their identity through discussion and debate\\\" and \\\"people who encountered grand discourse through staying up all night discussing and contemplating during university naturally show strength in essay-writing, especially integrated essay-writing, more than other subjects.\\\" He also adds that \\\"even among instructors from the 90s class, those who studied social sciences a lot during university are naturally strong in essay-writing.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-ung of Eureka Essay-Writing Academy also says \\\"essay-writing classes are similar to seminar formats where one senior forms a team with juniors to read social science books and discuss.\\\" \\\"Student movement instructors who entered the essay-writing market are mostly people who enjoy reading books and discussing with children.\\n\\nThey didn't approach essay-writing as a business model but enjoyed essay-writing classes themselves.\\\" He adds that \\\"perhaps they succeeded precisely because they didn't approach it as a business model.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Cho Dong-gi also says \\\"one virtue of student movement people is trust in people. I've never once viewed children as money. That aspect seems to have worked out.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee Yun-ho of Choam analyzes that \\\"continuous self-development desire and instructors' community consciousness became the foundation of success.\\\" One example is the all-night seminar held every Sunday from 12 PM to 6 AM.\\n\\nChoam has maintained the tradition of Sunday all-night seminars for the past 13 years since the Siheung period. All instructors attend without exception and intensely discuss 'what to teach the children.' Based on content discussed here, Choam develops class models and makes important hagwon decisions.\\n\\nCEO Lee says \\\"when hiring instructors, we ask whether they can participate in all-night seminars. If they can't, we don't hire them.\\\" This shows how important all-night seminars are in Choam's culture. After seminars end, after-parties follow.\\n\\nAccordingly, they disagree with criticism that \\\"people who wanted to transform society are now running hagwon businesses and making big money.\\\" CEO Lee Yun-ho says \\\"the problem is thinking of hagwon education and public education as separate.\\\" He also points out that \\\"education has public character regardless of what kind of education it is. The difference is whether it's institutional or not. What actually provides fragmentary, entrance exam-focused education isn't hagwons but schools.\\\" CEO Lee's continuing argument:\\n\\n\\\"Choam entered the essay-writing market to find an alternative to rote institutional education. Essay-writing fundamentally cannot be rote education. Training to read and think independently is the core of essay-writing. In this sense, we think we're actually doing alternative education and education movement.\\\"\\n\\nHe adds that \\\"we had many concerns about entering the hagwon education market, but we try to resolve those concerns by pursuing alternative education.\\\" The product of such concerns is the teacher academy 'House Woven with Grass,' which opened last April with progressive professors including Hong Se-hwa, editorial writer for <Hankyoreh Newspaper>, Professor Cho Han Hye-jeong of Yonsei University, and Im Heon-yeong, director of the Institute for Research in Collaborationist Activities. CEO Lee supports 'House Woven with Grass' with 20 million won [approximately $15,000 USD] monthly, meaning to return money earned from the hagwon to society.\\n\\nDirector Cho Dong-gi also points out that \\\"the core issue isn't hagwon education but hagwon education costs.\\\" He argues that filling deficient areas to win in competitive society shouldn't be viewed negatively.\\n\\n\\\"The logic of people criticizing hagwon education is that wealth is inherited through expensive hagwon education. If so, they should question expensive private tutoring, not hagwon classes. Hagwon classes costing about 150,000 won [approximately $113 USD] per month can rather be called mass education.\\\"\\n\\n**07 How Much Do Famous Essay-Writing Instructors Earn?**\\n*About 10 instructors earn over 100 million won annually... 4-5 year instructors earn 60-70 million won [approximately $45,000-52,500 USD]*\\n\\nContrary to the common belief that 'essay-writing instructor = over 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] annual salary,' even among so-called successful essay-writing instructors, not many earn over 100 million won annually, according to essay-writing hagwon officials. Instructors earning over 100 million won annually number only about 10 throughout the entire essay-writing market. You have to be a 'brand' instructor to earn over 100 million won annually. Unlike language or math subjects, essay-writing cannot accommodate large-scale lectures.\\n\\n\\\"Usually, star instructors give large lectures gathering anywhere from at least 100 to as many as 300 students at once, but essay-writing, due to subject characteristics, requires classes of about 10 students at most. You can't exceed 20 at most. Industrially speaking, it's a low-value-added industry. Therefore, it's a subject where star instructors or over 100 million won salaries are difficult to achieve.\\\"\\n\\nThis is Director Lee Hae-ung of Eureka's explanation. He adds that \\\"recently quite a few instructors from other subjects are switching to essay-writing instructors, but if making money is the purpose, it's incomprehensible.\\\" While varying by hagwon, the general consensus in this field is that 4-5 year essay-writing instructors earn average annual salaries of 60-70 million won [approximately $45,000-52,500 USD].\\n\\nExceptionally, Choam Essay-Writing Academy has established a kind of salary peak system at around 45 million won [approximately $33,750 USD]. Befitting a hagwon that emphasizes community consciousness, this is because too large salary differences among instructors could create discord.\\n\\nAnother reason essay-writing instructors' salaries are lower than other subjects is that unlike other subjects, essay-writing hagwons are a market that briefly flourishes only during admissions season. CEO Lee Yun-ho says \\\"the essay-writing market is where you must earn a year's worth by working 8 weeks. This applies even to famous hagwons and famous instructors, without exception.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough essay-writing has recently become important, in the case of high school seniors, almost no students attend essay-writing hagwons during the school term. Most 'go all-in' for 8 weeks around early admission periods or after the CSAT ends. This is why 'no-questions-asked expensive private tutoring' particularly thrives in the essay-writing market.\\n\\nUnder such circumstances, what hagwons have turned their attention to create a 'stable virtuous cycle structure' is the elementary and middle school student market, which has relatively more time flexibility. Particularly from hagwons' perspective, elementary students are even more attractive because they can conduct classes year-round without 'vacation periods' (during midterm and final exam periods each semester, hagwons except for school records hagwons rest for almost a month each. Hagwon instructors call this period 'vacation'). Hagwon officials analyze that overall, the elementary and middle school market is much larger than the high school admissions market.\\n\\nThe hagwon that first entered the elementary school market was Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Academy. Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Research Institute had already entered the elementary essay-writing market in 2002, supplying self-developed elementary student textbooks and education programs to franchise hagwons.\\n\\nThe elementary division business that started with 10 franchises in the first year benefited from last year's essay-writing boom, adding over 1,000 franchises in just one year, with currently 1,600 franchises operating nationwide. Cho Dong-gi Korean Essay-Writing Specialist Hagwon shows strength in the middle school division. Choam also plans to enter the elementary market soon.\\n\\nOfficials unanimously say the essay-writing market is now in its infancy stage. The possibility of growing much more in the future is strong. Instructor Yoon Seong-jin of Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon diagnoses that \\\"within the next 3-5 years, as subjective question ratios increase in each subject, ultimately all subjects will change to essay-writing format\\\" and \\\"today's major educational trend is flowing toward strengthening essay-writing education.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-ung of Eureka also says \\\"when the CSAT was first implemented, everyone was bewildered. It took hagwons several years to settle into the CSAT system. The essay-writing market will probably be similar.\\\"\\n\\nJust as the change from academic achievement tests to CSAT in university admissions brought massive change to the hagwon world, the prediction dominates that a big bang will sweep the hagwon world within 3-4 years as university admissions change from CSAT-focused to essay-writing-focused.\\n\\nOh Hyo-rim, Monthly JoongAng reporter\\nMore magazine articles\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 14734, "output_tokens": 8116, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
