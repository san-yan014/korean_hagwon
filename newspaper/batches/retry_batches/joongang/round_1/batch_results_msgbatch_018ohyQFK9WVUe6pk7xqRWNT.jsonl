Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] kids' yesterday, today, and tomorrow\\n\\nMetro G Team = Ahn Hye-ri, Lee Won-jin, Kim So-yeop, Park Hyung-su, Jeon Min-hee, Kang Na-hyeon reporters, Photo = Kim Kyung-rok reporter\\n\\nTheir children's grade levels, husbands' occupations, personal educational backgrounds, and ages were all different, but they agreed on exactly one point. They had \\\"boarded a train with no brakes (college entrance exams).\\\" While outsiders see this as precarious, no one in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] wants to get off this train.\\n\\nInstead, they say \\\"we're fortunate to be able to board this train even now.\\\" The reason is that there's no place like Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] for surviving Korea's persistent and tiresome credential-based society. They firmly believed that \\\"sending children to good universities is the only way to climb the ladder of social mobility, or at least maintain the same social status as our generation.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Lee (40, female), who finished 10 years of living in America and moved to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] last year for her two children's education, said, \\\"I wish someone could prove that this path I'm walking isn't the right answer,\\\" adding \\\"but until I know this isn't the answer, I absolutely cannot stop.\\\"\\n\\nEspecially the Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] who have staked everything on their children's education desperately cling to hagwon education. Because they pour everything into education costs, they can't even dream of preparing for retirement. Their future is mortgaged to their children's hagwon education. To people outside Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], this is truly a 'strange land.' But from the perspective inside Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], it's the most rational choice.\\n\\nLee (42, female), who moved into Eunma Apartments in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] on jeonse [a Korean housing rental system where tenants pay a large lump sum deposit instead of monthly rent] last year, is a somewhat unusual case. Usually mothers push to come here, but in the Lee family, it was her husband Jeong (47) who strongly wanted it. The trigger was when their son, who had been doing well in middle school, saw his grades drop. Jeong said, \\\"My boss at work, who sent all his kids to university from Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], told me 'there's no place like Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] for educating kids,'\\\" so he immediately had them pack their belongings. At first, Jeong also hesitated. But his boss's words \\\"think of it as an investment in your child\\\" were decisive.\\n\\nJeong became unemployed when his company went bankrupt during the 1997 financial crisis. He now works as a deputy manager at a large corporation, but that experience still remains a wound. During his unemployment, Jeong blamed his mediocre educational background a lot. He confided, \\\"I felt painfully that you need at least good credentials to somehow survive.\\\"\\n\\nJeong's monthly salary is approximately 5 million won [approximately $3,750 USD]. Half of that goes to hagwon fees for his son (17) and daughter (14). Although his mother-in-law is unwell and requires monthly hospital expenses, he says hagwon education costs absolutely cannot be reduced. Lee said, \\\"2.5 million won [approximately $1,875 USD] per month for two kids is probably not a very large amount in this neighborhood,\\\" adding \\\"we sent the kids to hagwons when we lived in Hwagok-dong too, but not to this extent.\\\" She said, \\\"Hwagok-dong is also a place with high interest in education, but coming here, it's a completely different world,\\\" sighing \\\"I'm so exhausted I want to go back, but my husband won't even listen, saying 'the kids need to study well so we can be comfortable later.'\\\"\\n\\nNot just the Lee family, but most Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] go 'all-in' on their children's education, or rather hagwon education. When we looked at the proportion of education costs relative to income, Daechi 1-2 dong reached 45.8%. This means they spend half their earnings on education costs. They use the other half for living expenses. Naturally, there's insufficient money left to invest for retirement.\\n\\nThe Korea Development Institute's report on domestic household education expenditure (2012) shows how serious the situation is. As of 2011, the education poor, so-called edu-poor, reached 824,000 households nationwide. A significant portion of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] belong to this category.\\n\\nWhy do they insist on being Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] even to the point of becoming penniless? The peculiarities of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] schools contribute to the locals' extreme hagwon education. Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] schools only have high-achieving top students and bottom-tier students who form the base. There's no middle. This is a strange phenomenon compared to schools in other areas where middle-tier students make up the majority.\\n\\nLee Ji-hyeon (42, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who has a second-year middle school son, said, \\\"When they take exams, it's either 90s or 40-50s,\\\" adding \\\"there are absolutely no mediocre scores in between.\\\" Lee cited the hagwon education effect as the reason. \\\"Children who receive proper hagwon education help from their mothers maintain top ranks, but without hagwon education, they can only hover in the bottom ranks.\\\"\\n\\nPark Eun-ju (41, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who has siblings in second year of middle school and first year of high school, said, \\\"Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] mothers don't just send their children to any hagwon, but accurately know their children's weak areas and send them to places that can supplement those areas,\\\" adding \\\"I feel frustrated when I see mothers who just go to hagwons saying 'please take good care of my child.'\\\" She added, \\\"Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] is a place where you can't compete unless mothers properly understand their children academically,\\\" explaining \\\"this is why it's difficult to succeed when you come at a mediocre time.\\\"\\n\\nThis means that native Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] children start hagwon education from kindergarten and systematically establish long and short-term plans, so it's not easy for children who transfer in middle or high school to quickly catch up to the study volume that native children have accumulated. That's why Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] mothers unanimously say, \\\"If you're considering becoming Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education], you must make the decision by fourth grade at the latest.\\\"\\n\\nChoi Eun-young (42, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]) said, \\\"Entry into Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] becomes harder to catch up the later you are,\\\" adding \\\"because this is a place where advanced learning proceeds with such intense rigor, when you transfer in the middle, both mothers and children struggle between keeping up with grade-level classes and advanced learning.\\\" As a result, they push themselves harder, and in this process, parent-child relationships often become strained.\\n\\nAccording to a Gangnam District Office survey, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] mothers had worse relationships with both their husbands and children compared to mothers in other Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] areas. When asked if they were satisfied with their relationships with their children, Apgujeong-dong mothers averaged 4.34 points (out of 5). However, Dogok 2-dong and Daechi 1-2 dong, which includes Tower Palace and is part of greater Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], scored only 3.5 and 4.1 points respectively.\\n\\nSatisfaction with spousal relationships showed similar patterns. Because parent-child relationships aren't good, children don't open up to their parents even when they have concerns. When asked who they would consult about their worries, only 13.9% of Daechi 1-2 dong students answered parents. Dogok 2-dong was slightly higher at 38.4%, but significantly lower compared to Apgujeong-dong (62.8%).\\n\\nMothers who drive their children into hagwon education to the point where families become distant. Perhaps it's because many mothers suffer from educational background complexes? However, reality is the opposite. Good educational backgrounds are basic, and there are many mothers with professional jobs like teachers or doctors that others envy. Regardless of educational background or occupation, mothers line up to become Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education].\\n\\nKim (48, female, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), a native Daechi resident, said, \\\"I don't understand why everyone flocks to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry],\\\" adding \\\"newcomers aren't welcome.\\\" Yet she also complained, \\\"Honestly, it's true that it's convenient for hagwon education compared to other areas and the academic atmosphere is far superior,\\\" but \\\"the image of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] has become too negative because of the overheated competition among Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] mothers.\\\"\\n\\nLee (41, female, Mapo District), a high school teacher, also sent her daughter (16), who became a high school student this year, to a Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] school. Lee said, \\\"Once you send them to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwons, as a working mother, you need to worry relatively less,\\\" explaining \\\"because the hagwons check every move of the children and inform mothers of each day's situation.\\\" She also said it was an advantage that \\\"children can feel viscerally that there's nothing to do but study wherever they go.\\\"\\n\\nWhile it seems like you need to abandon 'yourself' and cling entirely to your children to properly care for them in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], there are quite a few opinions that it's actually a customized neighborhood for working mothers. The logic is that because you can't check on children daily like full-time housewives do, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], which is a perfect 'vacuum state' except for studying, is optimal.\\n\\nDr. Baek (50, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]) said, \\\"It's not easy for working mothers to get information from other mothers,\\\" adding \\\"female doctors in the Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] area have created a female doctor community to share information.\\\" She claimed, \\\"There are hagwons that meticulously analyze children's study tendencies, which actually resolves anxiety.\\\" She said, \\\"Hagwons send real-time texts about children's movement routes, so I can feel at ease,\\\" adding \\\"Even though I'm a busy mother, I'm confident that I know thoroughly about my child's grades and life.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, some say that mothers who catch both rabbits of their own careers and Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] education are not mainstream in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]. Most Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] mothers said, \\\"Success as Daejeon-jok [families who relocate to Daechi-dong specifically for their children's education] is guaranteed by mothers' sacrifice.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, it's not sacrifice without compensation. Children repay their mothers' sacrifice with results: prestigious universities and professional jobs after graduation.\\n\\nByeon Hee-geum (48, female, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]) said, \\\"Because my husband went abroad as an expatriate, our whole family lived in Ecuador and Venezuela, and when we first returned to Korea, we lived in Bundang,\\\" adding \\\"all the kids speak English at native level, but we couldn't find hagwons that matched their level in Bundang, so we came to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] four years ago.\\\" Her son, who was a high school freshman at the time, adapted well going between Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] schools and hagwons, and smoothly entered Sungkyunkwan University's Global Studies program. Byeon said, \\\"Having lived here, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] is the best neighborhood for teaching kids to study,\\\" adding \\\"no matter what level a child is at, you can find a hagwon here that offers classes at exactly the right level.\\\" She also added, \\\"If you use it well, it's not something to view only negatively.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Kim (44, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]) and his wife have a similar stance. The couple receives consulting from education experts together while educating their two middle school sons. What's unique is that they only provide hagwon education for two subjects and have the brothers study self-directedly. Both maintain top grades at Daecheong Middle School.\\n\\nThe surrounding reactions are interesting. Wife Jeon's (42) explanation: \\\"I don't go to mothers' gatherings much. Since our kids don't receive much hagwon education but study well, surrounding mothers are very interested. They constantly call and point out that 'you're educating your children wrong.' They advise that kids should try bad things in advance, telling me to 'let them go to PC rooms too.' They also offer to include them in projects with their own kids. Whenever I feel anxious wondering if I'm doing wrong, my husband helps me stay centered, saying 'don't be swayed.' It's that the Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] mothers who go on hagwon pilgrimages attack us to justify their own behavior.\\\"\\n\\nJeon said, \\\"It's really difficult to educate children when spouses think differently,\\\" adding \\\"fortunately, we are of one mind, so we were able to maintain our philosophy.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 7112, "output_tokens": 4340, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
{"custom_id": "article_1", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_019GKvTj2mBjEfnTfApjxXXf", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"[Cover Story] The Truth About Performance Assessment\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"One mother with a middle school child says: Her child's performance assessments are nothing but torture for the mother, everything is wrong from beginning to end. The school teacher says: The problem is mothers who interfere with every aspect of their child's academic process and don't trust the school.\\n\\nSo we listened to both mothers and schools. We met mothers whose children attend 14 schools including Gyeongwon Middle School, Daemyeong Middle School, Daewang Middle School, Daecheong Middle School, Sehwa Girls' Middle School, Sungmun Middle School, Sindong Middle School, Sinsa Middle School, Apgujeong Middle School, Yeoksam Middle School, Changdeok Girls' Middle School, Changmun Girls' Middle School, Cheongdam Middle School, and Hwimon Middle School. The more complaints mothers had about schools, the more their memories differed from teachers' to the point where it was questionable whether they were talking about the same performance assessments.\\n\\nWould you like to judge what the truth really is?\\n\\nLast April, apples suddenly sold out at fruit stores around Guhyundai Apartments in Apgujeong-dong. The reason for the apple shortage was none other than a home economics performance assessment at nearby Apgujeong Middle School. How are performance assessments conducted that such things happen? We listened to parents from 14 middle schools in Seoul. When compiled, roughly five types of complaints emerged.\\n\\nFirst, they don't understand what educational purpose the performance assessment tasks serve. Second, they don't understand what criteria are used for evaluation. Third, they don't understand why things not taught in school are being evaluated. Fourth, they don't understand why tasks are sent home instead of being done during school hours. Finally, they claim it's reverse discrimination against male students.\\n\\nThe mother of Mr. Choi, who has a son in first grade at Apgujeong Middle School, said, \\\"When I heard they were doing apple peeling in a spiral as a performance assessment, the family sat around to demonstrate apple peeling, and the child peeled over 10 apples for the first time in his life even though no one was going to eat them.\\\" She said, \\\"Spiral apple peeling isn't an easy task for a child who has never held a fruit knife,\\\" adding with a grimace, \\\"We ended up using half a box of apples for practice but still only got a B.\\\"\\n\\nAnother parent, Mr. Kim, made this claim: \\\"They timed the test and my child got nervous and first quartered the apple. Then the teacher immediately gave him a D. Couldn't they give him another chance to peel an apple? What help is apple peeling ability going to be in life...\\\"\\n\\nMr. Choi's mother told a similar story. \\\"My child practiced frying eggs the night before the technology and home economics performance assessment, making a mess of the kitchen, but still got a C,\\\" she said. \\\"The reason for getting a C was that another friend accidentally knocked over the frying pan while passing by.\\\" She said, \\\"Later I pleaded for another chance since it wasn't our child's fault, and the teacher raised the score of the child who knocked over the pan from A to B, and our child's score from C to B,\\\" complaining, \\\"Won't this just make relationships between children worse?\\\"\\n\\nThere are also complaints about English performance assessments. The complaint is about the 'mileage book' system where students receive one stamp each time they interview with a native speaker teacher. This is because not all students get equal opportunities - interviews with native speakers are limited to 5 students per day on a first-come, first-served basis. A parent of second-grader Kim said, \\\"Even though regular arrival time is 8:30 AM, even going to school at 7:30 AM often fails to secure an interview appointment,\\\" claiming, \\\"Notebooks with many stamps often get stolen.\\\" He said, \\\"I don't understand why they conduct evaluations that make kids steal and mothers suspicious of each other.\\\"\\n\\nSecond: Ambiguous evaluation methods\\nThere are many complaints about scoring based on handwriting style and volume rather than content. A parent at Sindong Middle School said, \\\"Recently there was a Korean performance assessment with the task 'Let me introduce myself,' so I asked senior mothers and they said you just need to write a lot with pretty handwriting,\\\" adding, \\\"Our child got an A but I felt bitter.\\\" She added, \\\"Hearing another child's mother blame herself saying 'I didn't have information so only our child suffered,' I thought this isn't studying but evaluation to match teacher preferences.\\\"\\n\\nThis means mothers' information networks affect not only hagwon education but also performance assessments significantly.\\n\\nThere are also high complaints about group evaluation methods.\\nA parent with a first-grader at Sehwa Girls' Middle School said, \\\"The current group evaluation system is where good students earn scores for poor students too,\\\" adding, \\\"It feels bad as only hardworking kids get taken advantage of.\\\" Third-grader Kim at Daewang Middle School had a similar experience in last year's physical education performance assessment. Kim's mother said, \\\"The task was for groups to create choreography and perform group dance, but nobody was motivated,\\\" adding, \\\"Our child alone stomped her feet creating the choreography, but when they couldn't perform the group dance in front of the teacher, they all got 0 points together.\\\" She said, \\\"After group evaluations end, there are often hurt feelings between children and parents,\\\" adding, \\\"If teachers can't manage by clearly dividing group member roles, I wish they wouldn't do group evaluations.\\\"\\n\\nThird: Testing without teaching\\nMany parents are bewildered when schools test things they haven't taught. They say isn't this the school saying it will only give high scores to students who improved their skills through hagwon education.\\n\\nA parent with a second-grade male student at Sinsa Middle School talked about music performance assessment. He said, \\\"They could teach instruments anyone can play like recorders and evaluate everyone equally with that, but I don't understand why they do group evaluation with ensemble that they don't even teach in school.\\\" The point is that children who received instrumental lessons from a young age inevitably get good scores. He concluded: \\\"Performance assessment scores correlate highly not with children's ability but with their family's economic power.\\\" \\\"For science performance assessments, you have to pay money and entrust it completely to professional companies to get good scores, and for music you have to attach vocal lessons to get scores. The saying that you can't quit hagwon education because of performance assessments is really true.\\\"\\n\\nA parent with a third-grade daughter at Apgujeong Middle School also said \\\"It's all about money,\\\" stating, \\\"Not only performance assessments but most school awards are often done by hagwon instructors while children just receive the awards.\\\"\\n\\nFourth: Performance assessments are mothers' scores\\nParents' biggest complaint is that performance assessments aren't finished at school but brought home. The moment that happens, it becomes mothers' homework.\\n\\nSinsa Middle School goes through upheaval every summer vacation because of science performance assessments. Students set research topics, then submit research results to be reflected as second semester science performance assessment scores.\\n\\nMs. Lee, mother of third-grader Jang at this school, said, \\\"It costs at least 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] to do one science performance assessment.\\\" Lee said, \\\"In first grade, not knowing better, I really let the child set his own research topic and only helped a little, but the score was low.\\\" When she visited the science teacher to ask about grading criteria, the teacher showed her a portfolio that received an A grade and a school award. It was a 20-page portfolio meticulously containing the process of setting hypotheses and verifying them through 4-5 experiments. It was obviously professional level. So in second grade, she entrusted everything to a science hagwon director in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]. Jang easily got an A. Lee said, \\\"I know it's not right, but since everyone does it that way, we can't help it,\\\" adding, \\\"Since the child dreams of going to a science high school or gifted school, there's no choice.\\\"\\n\\nTeacher Jung (science) at a middle school in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] said, \\\"When we see performance assessment results that exceed student levels, teachers agonize over whether to exclude them entirely or judge that educational achievement was made in the process of receiving help and give scores,\\\" explaining, \\\"Most teachers choose the latter.\\\"\\n\\nFifth: Reverse discrimination against male students?\\nThe mother of a third-grade male student at Gyeongwon Middle School said, \\\"For performance assessments, female students try to get scores but male students just aim to participate.\\\" A third-grade parent at Yeoksam Middle School also says, \\\"If you send a boy to a coeducational school, you give up on performance assessments to some extent even before enrollment.\\\"\\n\\nThis is because performance assessment items often include 'bringing required materials' and 'attitude evaluation.' Male students are generally less meticulous and often fail to understand the performance assessment tasks pouring in from each subject. Also, note-taking included in performance assessments for each subject makes it easier for female students who write prettily and organize well to get scores.\\n\\nThe gender gap widens further in practical performance assessments. For example, technology and home economics subjects mainly test cooking, knitting, and cross-stitch making, giving female students an advantage.\\n\\nPhysical education is exceptionally advantageous for male students. But since different standards are applied for males and females, it's useless. That's why there are claims of \\\"reverse discrimination - applying the same standards in subjects favorable to female students while applying different standards in physical education favorable to male students.\\\"\\n\\nTeacher Shim (38, Korean) at a middle school in Mapo District said it's \\\"a valid point,\\\" adding, \\\"Including materials and attitude in performance assessments is teachers' dereliction of duty.\\\" Since performance assessment is a learning process, activity tasks that match the learning objectives of the relevant unit should be given. He claimed this phenomenon is \\\"one of the adverse effects created as the proportion of female teachers increased.\\\"\\n\\nYeoksam Middle School has high parent satisfaction\\nNot a few parents support performance assessments. Schools receiving parent support had different performance assessment operation methods. They prepared mechanisms to prevent the five complaints above from interfering. For example, Daecheong Middle School, Daemyeong Middle School, and Yeoksam Middle School finish performance assessments at school. This eliminates opportunities for parent involvement. Feedback is also thorough. When Daecheong Middle School conducts music singing performance assessments, teachers mark on the score where students made mistakes. Instead of just announcing scores, they teach the parts where mistakes were made.\\n\\nSchools' claims\\nTeachers: \\\"Most complaints arise from parent misunderstandings\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it were Korean, English, or math, that would be different, but making a fuss over technology and home economics performance assessments - aren't mothers overreacting?\\\"\\n\\nMany parents react this way when hearing that mothers are troubled by their children's performance assessments. The criticism is that they're reacting too sensitively when middle school first-graders (current second-graders) changed from relative to absolute evaluation for school records [GPA], and only autonomous private high schools like Hana High School and Minjok Leadership Academy reflect all subject grades rather than just major subjects in high school admissions.\\n\\nTeachers find it even more incomprehensible. Kim Sung-hee, Hana High School's planning and public relations director, emphasized, \\\"Reflecting all subjects' school records [GPA] in admissions means to faithfully complete middle school life,\\\" adding, \\\"Hana High School admits students at the 4-5% level of middle school school records [GPA], so there's no need to overdo it for 1-2 performance assessment points.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, mothers obsessing over performance assessments think differently. Ms. An (42, Banpo-dong, Seoul) claimed, \\\"Grades are displayed as absolute evaluation grades, but schools still rank students from first to last,\\\" adding, \\\"Absolute evaluation is just 'covering your eyes and crying.'\\\" Another parent whose daughter is preparing for Hana High School admission said, \\\"You can quickly calculate subject rankings by looking at grade averages and standard deviations by school in addition to school record [GPA] grades,\\\" adding, \\\"There probably isn't a Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] mother who believes the story that admissions only look at school record [GPA] grades.\\\" The logic is that since rankings are still important, not even one point can be neglected in any subject.\\n\\nWhether it's mothers' groundless worries or schools' problems is unclear, but there was strong mutual distrust between parents and schools.\\n\\nA parent at Daewang Middle School claimed, \\\"We had group dance as a physical education performance assessment, but other kids in the group were insincere, so our child worked hard but got 0 points.\\\" However, Joo Mi-kyung, the physical education department head at this school, countered, \\\"Since the basic score is 12 out of 20 points, the claim of getting 0 points is false to begin with,\\\" adding, \\\"We guided practice during class time for 3 weeks and watched the process, so the parent's claim is groundless.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Daewang Middle School removed group dance from performance assessment items entirely this year due to many such parent complaints.\\n\\nSinsa Middle School, which had students submit 'science free inquiry reports' during summer vacation and reflected this as second semester science performance assessment scores, also stated, \\\"Starting this year, we decided to accept free inquiry reports only from those who wish and exclude them from performance assessment items, and we plan to announce this soon.\\\" Jung Sung-geun, vice principal of this school, also claimed that complaints about instrumental ensemble evaluation, which has high parent criticism, are \\\"misunderstandings.\\\" Mothers believed you need to use high-end instruments like cellos and violins to get good scores. But he explained, \\\"You can get full marks even playing only with recorders.\\\"\\n\\nSindong Middle School, where complaints were raised that Korean performance assessments give scores based on handwriting style rather than content and send tasks home, also clarified that this is \\\"different from facts.\\\" Ma Hee-chang, vice principal of this school, said, \\\"We evaluate objectively based on the responsible teacher's expertise, and the principle is that all performance tasks are completed at school.\\\"\\n\\nApgujeong Middle School also reacted with \\\"frustration.\\\" They claim that students and parents completely misunderstood the purpose of the problematic 'mileage book.' An English teacher at this school said, \\\"Mileage book stamps can be obtained through many other methods besides first-come-first-served native speaker interviews,\\\" adding, \\\"Students who don't prepare properly engage in stamp battles one or two days before inspection.\\\" Regarding apple peeling and egg frying performance assessments, a home economics teacher at this school said, \\\"We evaluated tool usage ability according to the Ministry of Education's 2008 experiential evaluation policy.\\\" Also, \\\"We never gave bad scores for quartering apples or accidentally knocking over frying pans,\\\" claiming, \\\"If students wanted, we gave sufficient time and opportunities.\\\"\\n\\nOverseas cases\\nUSA also had fairness disputes initially, but gained parent trust through thorough feedback\\n\\n\\\"We should consider that only the name 'performance assessment' was borrowed (from foreign countries).\\\"\\n\\nThis is education experts' common opinion about performance assessments implemented in domestic elementary, middle, and high schools. Performance assessment was introduced in 1999 with the intent to check students' learning activities and establish individualized teaching plans. However, performance (遂行・the act of actually carrying out work or tasks) has disappeared and only assessment remains.\\n\\nProfessor Song In-seop (Education) at Sookmyung Women's University pointed out, \\\"Performance assessment has deteriorated into just another tool for ranking,\\\" adding, \\\"We only borrowed the framework of performance assessment while actually following the limitations of written exams.\\\"\\n\\nOne country that started performance assessment before Korea is the United States. Private schools introduced it early, and public schools also began full-scale introduction in the late 1980s as part of educational reform. The trigger was the 1983 report 'A Nation at Risk' related to educational competitiveness. This report worried about declining academic achievement, stating, \\\"American students' academic achievement levels are very low internationally, and about 30% of all 17-year-old students cannot read.\\\"\\n\\nAmerica's educational reform to raise academic achievement can be summarized in three main points. First, strengthening school and teacher accountability. Second, introducing state-level academic achievement tests and improving grades through them. Finally, expanding performance assessment.\\n\\nEach public school conducted performance assessments by assigning project-type tasks such as research and investigation reports or experiments and practices, creating essay and written exams, and introducing various team activities into classes. Performance assessment subsequently gained attention as a new educational model that breaks away from memorization-centered education and nurtures creative talent capable of applying and integrating knowledge.\\n\\nLee Ki-dong, elementary principal at NLCS Jeju International School who worked in education in the United States for 25 years from 1985, said, \\\"In the mid-1980s, American public schools focused only on ranking students by test scores,\\\" adding, \\\"Performance assessment supplemented this.\\\"\\n\\nHan So-young (Sogang University International Korean Studies 2), who graduated from Dwight-Englewood School, a private school in New Jersey, said, \\\"They tell me in detail about performance assessment results - what I lack and what points I need to supplement,\\\" adding, \\\"Perhaps because of this, I generally trust teachers' evaluations.\\\"\\n\\nPrincipal Lee Ki-dong said, \\\"America also had much confusion in the early days of performance assessment introduction due to issues of fairness and objectivity in the evaluation process,\\\" but explained, \\\"Now it's much more stable.\\\" He said, \\\"When performance assessment grading criteria were accurately announced in advance and teachers provided detailed guidance to parents about evaluation results after assessment, parents came to trust the evaluation results.\\\"\\n\\nKim Myung-hwa, research fellow at the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, also evaluated that \\\"the feedback process was important\\\" in America's performance assessment establishment process. She gave an example of an elementary school in LA. \\\"For instance, if it's a writing class, the teacher who guided that student's writing throughout the semester compiles all the evaluations and advice given during the curriculum, as well as evaluation of the final product, into one book and sends it to parents. Parents can understand what their child lacks and how to help at home just by looking at this book, and can plan future studies.\\\"\\n\\nThis contrasts with Korea, where evaluation results are only marked as scores on report cards.\\n\\n◆ Performance Assessment = Evaluates students' participation and achievements shown in the learning process, such as project-type tasks like research and investigation reports or experiments and practices, and various team activities. It emerged as a new educational model as criticism arose that existing written exams force memorization-style education and rank students according to test scores. The United States began full-scale introduction in the late 1980s, and it was first introduced to Korea in 1996, then implemented simultaneously in all elementary, middle, and high schools nationwide in 1999. Each city and provincial education office only provides guidelines for minimum ratios of performance assessment by subject, while specific matters related to evaluation methods and implementation timing are left to each school's discretion.\\n\\nWritten by reporter Ahn Hye-ri = reporters Park Hyung-soo, Jung Hyun-jin, Jeon Min-hee / Photos by reporter Kim Kyung-rok\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10096, "output_tokens": 4625, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

These common clichés can all describe international schools. Since Songdo Chadwick International School, the first foreign educational institution in the Seoul metropolitan area, opened in 2010, followed by NLCS Jeju, KIS Jeju, and BHA opening consecutively in 2011 and 2012 in Jeju English Education City, international schools have continuously been 'hot potatoes' that attract both interest and controversy. While established under the pretext of substituting for overseas study abroad demand, they remained merely 'pie in the sky' for most parents due to expensive tuition and geographical limitations, and were like 'sour grapes' for many Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] mothers who were anxious about blindly jumping on board without proper verification. We examined international schools.\\n\\nWhat Did I Gain and Lose in Songdo and Jeju?\\n\\nInternational schools are places where you can educate your children using American or British private school systems in Korea without sending them abroad to study. Unlike foreign schools that require three years of overseas residence for admission eligibility, Korean nationals can freely attend. However, they have the disadvantages of annual tuition fees of up to 50 million won [approximately $38,000 USD] and long commute times or requiring relocation since there are none in Seoul. Since the oldest, Chadwick International School, opened in 2010, it's true that they remain unverified in many aspects. We met mothers who send their children to international schools in Songdo and Jeju to ask why they made such choices despite this, and whether they're satisfied.\\n\\nKim Ju-seon (41), who transferred her child from a public school in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] to Songdo Chadwick International School last year, commuted from their Dogok-dong home for a year before the entire family moved to Songdo this year. This was because her second child was also entering Chadwick in the fall, so they judged it better to settle in Songdo as soon as possible. Kim said, \\\"Since my child had adapted well to the Daechi-dong system, when I said we were transferring, other mothers all said, 'Are you crazy to leave safe Daechi-dong?'\\\" She added, \\\"In the early days after transfer, rumors spread that 'the school wasn't as good as expected, so they eventually sent the child abroad.'\\\"\\n\\nShe said, \\\"This reaction was probably due to Gangnam mothers' anxiety about an unverified school,\\\" adding, \\\"Now there are significantly more Daechi-dong mothers asking for international school admission information.\\\"\\n\\nSince the Temple Is Disliked, the Monk Must Leave\\n\\nThen why did they choose international schools in the first place?\\n\\nThe answer can be found in the words of Baek Eun-kyung (39), a founding member who has sent her child to Chadwick since its opening. She said, \\\"The first weapon for controlling my fifth-grader is saying 'I'll take you out of school,'\\\" adding, \\\"That's how much my child loves school.\\\"\\n\\nJeon (45), who sends her child to Branksome Hall Asia (BHA) elementary 3rd grade after attending a public school in Seoul and then North London Collegiate School (NLCS) Jeju, said, \\\"At Korean schools, when children ask questions, teachers always say 'You're noisy' or 'Be quiet,'\\\" adding, \\\"Here they kindly answer all questions, so my child finds school so fun.\\\" She also said \\\"laughter has increased.\\\"\\n\\nShin Mi-seon (41), who lived in Daechi-dong and moved to Canons Village right in front of NLCS Jeju, said, \\\"We lived in Bundang, then after English language study in New Zealand, transferred to Daechi-dong in 6th grade, but life there was no joke,\\\" adding, \\\"Looking at my middle school nephew living in Daechi-dong, as soon as school ended, he'd rush to English and math hagwons and come home exhausted at 11 PM.\\\" She explained her reason for coming to Jeju: \\\"Even if I didn't want to, living in Daechi-dong seemed like I wouldn't be able to escape that lifestyle.\\\" Of the 180 households in Canons Village where she lives, most are parents and school staff of this school. Her husband's workplace is in Seoul, so they live a wild goose family life [where family members live separately for educational reasons].\\n\\nKim Eun-ji (39), who sends her first and second children to NLCS Jeju and BHA respectively, said, \\\"Having no time to play is the same as when attending Korean schools,\\\" but added, \\\"However, what they do with remaining time is different.\\\" In Korea, they endlessly make rounds of hagwons after school, but here they spend time doing school homework that requires independent thinking.\\n\\nIn fact, not a few cases involve choosing international schools for parents rather than children. Kang Ji-young (42), who came from Mok-dong to Songdo, is somewhat like that. She said, \\\"I transferred my child when my nephew from Canada entered Chadwick Middle,\\\" adding, \\\"At first I thought if necessary, I'd send him back to a Korean school, but I'm satisfied.\\\" It's not just satisfaction. Kang even said, \\\"Now I've finally found my life.\\\" Kang lived as a typical helicopter mom in Mok-dong. When her child studied, she sat across from him and solved workbooks together. All daily activities were centered around the child, leaving no personal time. But now it's different. Thanks to the school system that makes children research on their own. She said, \\\"The kind of mother role I had before is no longer needed.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, international schools aren't heaven for all parents. Especially mothers living wild goose lives in Jeju often struggle due to the very different environment from Seoul. Kim (41), who sends two children to BHA, said, \\\"It's just school and home in the middle of nowhere,\\\" adding, \\\"To buy anything, you have to drive 30-40 minutes, so many mothers get depression.\\\" Song Su-hyeon (40), who sends three children to Jeju international schools, also said, \\\"Since I came down leaving my husband behind, life is monotonous, so at first mothers stick together closely, then sometimes turn their backs over trivial misunderstandings.\\\" She also added, \\\"Mothers who came to Jeju came prepared to go all-in on their children's education,\\\" adding, \\\"Adjusting everything to children's school schedules, they all experience depression at least once, but overcome it thinking it's a sacrifice to raise children as global leaders.\\\"\\n\\nEscaping Hagwon Education Is a Fantasy\\n\\nNLCS Jeju parent Lee (35) said, \\\"There are English and math hagwons that teach in English,\\\" adding, \\\"Mothers who think about returning to Korean schools pay more attention to hagwon education, but in Jeju, hagwon education is a choice, not a necessity.\\\" She also said, \\\"We usually live near school, but to get to Nohyeong-dong where the hagwon district is, you have to drive 40 minutes by car, so it's practically impossible on weekdays.\\\"\\n\\nKim Eun-ji, who sends two children to Jeju international schools, also said, \\\"Here, hagwon education is a choice,\\\" adding, \\\"That's also why I didn't send them to KIS Jeju even though it's in Jeju.\\\" When she went to an admission briefing and asked \\\"Do we need to do advance math learning?\\\" the answer was \\\"Do it if necessary.\\\" She said, \\\"The other two schools in Jeju say 'absolutely don't send children to hagwons,'\\\" asking, \\\"If we're going to teach Korean-style, why would we come all the way to Jeju?\\\"\\n\\nThere's also the argument that while they provide a lot of hagwon education just like when attending Korean schools, the content of hagwon education is different.\\n\\nSong (50), a BHA 10th grade parent, said, \\\"Since math is somewhat lacking compared to Korean schools, we sometimes provide math tutoring,\\\" adding, \\\"Some people send children to become better at English, but more than that, arts and sports hagwon education is the trend.\\\"\\n\\nLee Eun-ah (43), a Chadwick elementary 3rd grade parent who moved from Bangbae-dong to Songdo, said, \\\"Here too, they provide a lot of hagwon education,\\\" but added, \\\"However, rather than Korean, English, and math, it's mainly arts and sports specialty hagwon education needed for foreign university admission like fencing or trumpet that aren't in school curriculum.\\\"\\n\\nEnglish or Mother Tongue... Still a Dilemma\\n\\nJeju international schools have no restrictions on the proportion of Korean nationals. Only KIS Jeju disclosed its foreign student ratio, which is a mere 3%. Excluding teachers' children, virtually all students are Korean.\\n\\nShin Mi-seon said, \\\"I've seen people send children to overseas boarding schools saying English doesn't improve,\\\" adding, \\\"The foreigners in my child's class are only Chinese students and foreign teachers' children.\\\"\\n\\nChadwick, being a foreign educational institution with restrictions on Korean national proportions (30%, 40% from fall 2014), has a higher foreign student ratio than Jeju international schools, but even so, it's not a 100% English environment. This is due not only to the realistic limitation of many Korean students and staff, but also school policy. Chadwick conducts Korean language and history classes in Korean. They also teach students to speak Korean to outsiders and working staff within school. There are no restrictions for using Korean.\\n\\nLee Hye-young, Chadwick's public relations director, said, \\\"This was something we thought about a lot,\\\" adding, \\\"Since it's difficult to be good at English if you can't properly use your mother tongue, we emphasize Korean.\\\"\\n\\nKim Yeon-jin (45), a BHA 9th grade parent, said, \\\"It's disappointing that there are no foreign students,\\\" but argued, \\\"However, being able to form peer culture with Korean students could be an advantage.\\\"\\n\\nChadwick will produce its first graduates in 2016. Yu Min-jeong (40), a high school 1st grade parent, said, \\\"It's true that we're anxious because there's no prestigious university admission rate yet,\\\" but added, \\\"However, since they didn't receive Korean-style uniform education, I expect they'll be able to go to prestigious foreign universities like those in America.\\\"\\n\\nWhy are they so confident despite having no clear success indicators related to academics like admission rates?\\n\\nFirst, all international schools either have main campuses abroad or are foundations already operating foreign schools domestically, so there's belief that their curricula are good like British and American private schools. But this isn't all. Three out of four international schools in Songdo and Jeju have introduced IB programs that can only be certified by having excellent educational programs.\\n\\nKim Yeon-jin cited the IB program as the reason for choosing BHA among international schools. She said, \\\"I understand that Ivy League schools significantly recognize IB diploma courses when selecting students.\\\" Song, who sends children to BHA and KIS Jeju respectively, said, \\\"BHA is more satisfactory.\\\" \\\"Perhaps because it's an IB program, all subjects can be learned very systematically and comprehensively.\\\"\\n\\nDistinctly Different Atmospheres... Some Complaints About Immature Operations\\n\\nEven among international schools, each school has a distinctly different atmosphere. Chadwick, which has its main campus in America, is definitely liberal. They don't even wear uniforms. In contrast, NLCS Jeju, being a British school, manages more strictly. BHA, a Canadian school, has a free atmosphere for lower grades but strict dormitory management from 4th grade as it becomes a girls' school. KIS Jeju, the only public school with tuition about 15 million won [approximately $11,500 USD] cheaper, has the reputation of paying excessive attention to college entrance exams in a Korean style.\\n\\nEspecially since they haven't been open long, there are cases where parents complain about operational problems.\\n\\nA parent who transferred from NLCS Jeju to BHA claimed, \\\"The school said they would teach Chinese when I enrolled my child, but after one year they changed it to Latin classes citing teacher supply problems,\\\" adding, \\\"Also, when the homeroom teacher was absent due to illness, the children were just left unattended that day.\\\" The school responded, \\\"The administrative office looks for substitute teachers,\\\" stating, \\\"There's no way children would have been left unattended.\\\"\\n\\nLong-term Success Depends on University Admission Rates\\n\\nMost international school parents have anxiety deep in their hearts. Unlike most foreign schools, while they can receive Korean academic credentials and enter domestic universities, realistically it's difficult to transfer to Korean schools.\\n\\nYang (42), whose NLCS Jeju 7th grade (middle school 1st year) child is preparing for specialized high schools, said, \\\"I'm keeping both domestic and foreign university admission paths open.\\\" Seo Ji-young (39), a KIS Jeju parent, also said, \\\"Having many choices, such as being able to prepare for Korean and foreign universities simultaneously, is this place's greatest advantage.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Chadwick parent Yu said, \\\"There have been children who switched direction to specialized high schools targeting domestic universities,\\\" but added, \\\"It wasn't because of poor academic ability, but because their study styles were different, so they all had difficulty when going to Korean schools.\\\"\\n\\nSo not a few parents say they'll decide based on the school's university admission results. Kim (41) said, \\\"NLCS Jeju's first university admission results come out this year,\\\" adding, \\\"Students are currently submitting applications to overseas universities, but if admission results aren't good, I'll return to Seoul without regrets.\\\" Parents seem to expect university admission results at the level of early Minjok Leadership Academy or Daewon Foreign Language High School's international division.\\n\\nConsequently, quite a few students quit international schools midway for various reasons. According to Rep. Shim Jae-cheol's office of the Saenuri Party, the dropout rate over one year from September last year was 21.6% for NLCS Jeju. KIS Jeju was 14.6%, BHA 14.5%, and Chadwick 7.8%. Reasons varied including overseas study, preparing for domestic university admission, school maladjustment, and personal circumstances. Some went to study in the Philippines because they couldn't afford it on office worker salaries, and some parents quit to go to international middle schools or specialized high schools.\\n\\nGoh Yong-min, team leader of Jeju Education Office's External Exchange Cooperation Division, argued, \\\"Since Jeju international schools were meant to retain students who would go abroad, they're fulfilling that role to some extent.\\\" Kim (38), a Jeju international school parent, said, \\\"Being able to return to Seoul anytime is one of international schools' major advantages.\\\"\\n\\nSongdo or Jeju... Choice Based on Educational Philosophy\\nChadwick for Those Who Dislike Wild Goose Life, Jeju for Various Choices\\n\\n\\\"I moved.\\\"\\n\\nSomeone who lived fine in Gangnam and recently moved, especially if they have school-age children, is definitely headed to Songdo without question. When you ask \\\"Chadwick?\\\" everyone nods. Dad's workplace continues to be in central Seoul, and mom's life radius has never left Gangnam, but they established a new base solely for their child. \\\"Hagwon rounds. Ugh, we can't do that. It's wrong for the child too. Jeju, no matter how much it's Korea, still means living a wild goose life just the same. Then there's only one answer.\\\"\\n\\nAfter moving to Songdo, Park (42) leaves home before 6 AM every day. He has no choice if he wants to commute before traffic jams. He's also significantly reduced after-work appointments. Even when he has appointments, he mostly goes home before 10 PM. It's quite a sacrifice. However, he said he's \\\"satisfied.\\\"\\n\\nKim Yu-jin (40), who moved from Pyeongchon to Songdo, said, \\\"When the school opened, some students commuted from Gangnam and other areas, but now about 80% of elementary student families have moved here entirely.\\\" Lee Eun-ah (43), who came from Bangbae-dong, also said, \\\"Chadwick seems to be mainly chosen by families who don't want family separation.\\\"\\n\\nNLCS Jeju, KIS Jeju, and BHA in Jeju can choose between dormitory and commuting from upper grades. Currently, NLCS Jeju and BHA allow dormitory life from elementary 5th grade, and KIS Jeju from elementary 4th grade. So while most are wild goose families where dad stays in Seoul and mom lives near school with children during lower grades, when they reach upper grades, the proportion of parents living in Seoul and visiting each other increases. The proportions of students who can use dormitories but commute are BHA 36%, KIS Jeju 28%, and NLCS Jeju 25%.\\n\\nSongdo or Jeju. The choice is largely divided by each family's educational philosophy. But this isn't all. Which country's educational method it follows and how many foreign students are enrolled are also considerations. Chadwick, being a foreign educational institution, cannot have more than 40% Korean nationals in principle, but Jeju international schools can be filled with 100% Korean nationals.\\n\\nYang (42), an NLCS Jeju parent whose main campus is in Britain, said, \\\"After living in Britain and coming back, my child sang songs about wanting to return to Britain,\\\" adding, \\\"Since I thought I should send him to a British-style school, I didn't consider other schools at all.\\\"\\n\\nReporters: Ahn Hye-ri, Kim So-yeop (Songdo), Jeon Min-hee (Jeju)\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9018, "output_tokens": 4352, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Yu Min-jung (40), a high school 1st grade parent, said, \\\"It's true that we feel anxious because there are no prestigious university admission rates yet\\\" but \\\"I expect they'll be able to go to prestigious foreign universities like those in America because they haven't received Korea's uniform education.\\\"\\n\\nWhy are they so confident despite having no clear success indicators related to academics like admission rates?\\n\\nFirst, there's the belief that international schools all have good curricula like Anglo-American private schools because they either have main schools abroad or are foundations already operating foreign schools domestically. But this isn't everything. Three out of four international schools in Songdo and Jeju have introduced IB programs that can only be certified with excellent educational programs. <Related article Gangnam Tongshin 4th page>\\n\\nKim Yeon-jin cited the IB program as the reason for choosing BHA among international schools. She said, \\\"I understand that Ivy League schools significantly recognize IB diploma programs when selecting students.\\\" Song, who sends children to BHA and KIS Jeju respectively, said, \\\"BHA is more satisfactory.\\\" \\\"Perhaps because it's an IB program, you can learn all subjects very systematically and comprehensively.\\\"\\n\\nDistinctly Different Atmospheres... Some Complaints About Immature Operations\\n\\nEven among international schools, each school has a distinctly different atmosphere. Chadwick, which has its main school in America, is definitely liberal. They don't even wear uniforms. In contrast, NLCS Jeju, being a British school, manages more strictly. BHA, a Canadian school, has a free atmosphere in lower grades but becomes strict in dormitory management from 4th grade as it becomes a girls' school. KIS Jeju, the only public school, has relatively affordable tuition at around 15 million won [approximately $11,250 USD], but there are evaluations that it focuses too much on college entrance exams Korean-style.\\n\\nEspecially since they haven't been open long, operational problems sometimes cause parent complaints.\\n\\nOne parent who transferred from NLCS Jeju to BHA claimed, \\\"The school initially said they would teach Chinese, so we enrolled, but after one year they changed it to Latin classes citing teacher supply problems\\\" and \\\"Also, when the homeroom teacher was absent due to illness, the children were left unattended that day.\\\" The school responded, \\\"The administrative office looks for substitute teachers\\\" and \\\"There's no way the children were left unattended.\\\"\\n\\nSuccess or Failure Will Be Determined by University Admission Rates in the Long Term\\n\\nMost international school parents harbor anxiety deep in their hearts. Unlike most foreign schools, while they can receive Korean academic credentials and enter domestic universities, realistically it's difficult to transfer to Korean schools.\\n\\nYang (42), whose NLCS Jeju 7th grade (middle school 1st year) child is preparing for specialized high schools, said, \\\"We're keeping both domestic and foreign university paths open.\\\" Seo Ji-young (39), a KIS Jeju parent, also said, \\\"Having many choices, such as being able to prepare for both Korean and foreign universities simultaneously, is this place's greatest advantage.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Chadwick parent Yu said, \\\"There was a child who changed direction to a specialized high school targeting domestic universities midway\\\" but \\\"It wasn't because of poor academic ability, but because of different study styles, everyone who goes to Korean schools has a hard time.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, many parents say they'll decide after seeing the school's college admission results. Kim (41) said, \\\"NLCS Jeju's first college admission results come out this year\\\" and \\\"Students are currently submitting applications to overseas universities, but if the admission results are poor, we'll return to Seoul without regret.\\\" Parents expect college admission results at the level of early Minjok Leadership Academy or Daewon Foreign Language High School's international program.\\n\\nConsequently, quite a few students quit international schools midway for various reasons. According to Saenuri Party lawmaker Sim Jae-chul's office, the dropout rate for one year from September last year was 21.6% for NLCS Jeju. KIS Jeju was 14.6%, BHA 14.5%, and Chadwick 7.8%. Reasons varied including overseas study, domestic university admission preparation, school maladjustment, and personal circumstances. There were cases of going to the Philippines for study because office worker salaries couldn't cover costs, and parents who quit to go to international middle schools or specialized high schools.\\n\\nKo Yong-min, team leader of Jeju Education Office's International Exchange Cooperation Unit, argued, \\\"Since Jeju international schools were meant to retain students who would otherwise go abroad, they're playing that role to some degree.\\\" Kim (38), a Jeju international school parent, said, \\\"Being able to make a U-turn to Seoul anytime is one of international schools' major advantages.\\\"\\n\\nSongdo or Jeju... Choice According to Educational Philosophy\\nChadwick for Those Who Dislike Goose Family Life, Jeju for Various Choices\\n\\n\\\"I moved.\\\"\\n\\nPeople who were living fine in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and recently moved, especially those with school-age children, are without question heading to Songdo. When you ask \\\"Chadwick?\\\" everyone nods. Dad's workplace continues to be in the heart of Seoul, and mom's life has never left Gangnam, but they've established new roots solely for their child. \\\"Hagwon rounds. Ugh, we can't do that. It's something we can't do to our child either. Jeju may be Korea, but in the end, it's the same as having to live a goose family lifestyle. Then there's only one answer.\\\"\\n\\nAfter moving to Songdo, Park (42) leaves home before 6 AM every day. He has no choice if he wants to commute before traffic gets bad. He's also significantly reduced after-work appointments. Even when he has appointments, he mostly goes home before 10 PM. It's no small sacrifice. However, he said he's \\\"satisfied.\\\"\\n\\nKim Yu-jin (40), who moved from Pyeongchon to Songdo, said, \\\"When the school opened, there were students commuting from Gangnam and other areas, but now about 80% of elementary student families have moved here entirely.\\\" Lee Eun-ah (43), who came from Bangbae-dong, also said, \\\"Chadwick seems to be mainly chosen by families who don't want family separation.\\\"\\n\\nNLCS Jeju, KIS Jeju, and BHA in Jeju offer choices between dormitory and commuting from upper grades. Currently, NLCS Jeju and BHA allow dormitory life from elementary 5th grade, and KIS Jeju from elementary 4th grade. So in lower grades, most are goose families where dad lives in Seoul while mom lives near school with the child, but in upper grades, the proportion increases where parents live in Seoul and visit each other. The proportion of students who commute despite being able to use dormitories is 36% for BHA, 28% for KIS Jeju, and 25% for NLCS Jeju.\\n\\nSongdo or Jeju. The choice is largely divided by each family's educational philosophy. But this isn't everything. Which country's educational method and how many foreign students are enrolled are also considerations. Chadwick, being a foreign educational institution, cannot in principle have more than 40% Korean nationals, but Jeju international schools can be filled with 100% Korean nationals.\\n\\nYang (42), an NLCS Jeju parent whose main school is in Britain, said, \\\"After living in Britain and coming back, my child sang about wanting to return to Britain\\\" and \\\"Since I thought we should send him to a British-style school, I didn't consider other schools at all.\\\"\\n\\nReporters: An Hye-ri, Kim So-yeop (Songdo), Jeon Min-hui (Jeju)\\nPromotion videos for each international school\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9018, "output_tokens": 4365, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
{"custom_id": "article_4", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_01Bz3FT3vdtuCFQ4K8c9ibb7", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"[Cover Story] Gangnam District's June 4th Local Elections... Who Will Be Bounced Out?\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Will it be the Saenuri Party's defense or Ahn Cheol-soo's new party's (New Politics Alliance) offensive? This is an interesting point to watch in the upcoming local elections in Gangnam's three districts [Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, and Songpa-gu, affluent districts in southern Seoul]. Will the Ahn Cheol-soo wind continue to blow, or will it just fizzle out on its own? And can the Democratic Party recover from its current disadvantage? We examined public sentiment in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul].\\nBy An Hye-ri, Photos by Kim Kyung-rok\\n\\nHowever, when Gangnam Tongshin commissioned the JoongAng Ilbo polling team and Survey Link to conduct an online panel survey of 400 voters in Gangnam's three districts on the 7th-8th, 30% responded that they support Ahn's new party. The gap with the Saenuri Party (33%) was not very large (※Although this survey had a relatively small sample of 400 people, reliability was enhanced by matching the number of respondents to resident registration composition ratios).\\n\\nOf course, even within Gangnam's three districts, there are differences in support rates by autonomous district. In Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu, Saenuri Party support is still higher. However, only in Songpa-gu was it 32.8%, higher than the Saenuri Party (25.2%). Songpa has stronger opposition tendencies compared to Gangnam and Seocho. However, in the 2012 National Assembly elections, Saenuri Party candidates won in all three constituencies (Gap, Eul, and Byeong), and in both the 2010 local elections and the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, the ruling party (then Grand National Party) narrowly defeated the main opposition party candidates. In recent years, Gangnam's three districts have been under Saenuri Party dominance.\\n\\nWhat Happened in Seocho-Gap?\\nCompared to the vote shares from the last local elections and Seoul mayoral by-election, Ahn's new party has simultaneously drawn votes from both Saenuri and Democratic parties in Gangnam's three districts. In other words, it has eaten into the support rates of both the ruling and main opposition parties. However, there's one place where it has particularly stolen many ruling party votes: Seocho-Gap.\\n\\nIn Seocho-Gap, during the last district head election and Seoul mayoral by-election, current district head Jin Ik-cheol and candidate Na Kyung-won of the Saenuri Party nearly doubled the votes of Democratic Party candidates Kwak Se-hyun and Park Won-soon. Their vote shares were 62.1% and 61.8% respectively. However, this survey shows Saenuri Party and Ahn's new party support rates tied at 32.7%. The vote share that left the Saenuri Party essentially flowed to Ahn's new party.\\n\\nSeocho-Gap constituency includes Jamwon-dong, Banpo-bon-dong, Banpo 1st-4th dong, Bangbae-bon-dong, and Bangbae 1st and 4th dong. It's relatively more affluent than Seocho-Eul. But why has ruling party support been particularly shaken in this area? The answer can be found in population composition changes due to reconstruction and changing educational demand. Banpo 1st and 2nd dong saw large-scale reconstruction complex move-ins begin in 2008 and 2009 respectively - Banpo Xi and Raemian Prestige. With new apartments, there was increased influx of people in their 30s. The proportion of people in their 30s rose from 18.6% in 2001 to 21.6% in 2010. As specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools continued to dominate, preferences for core areas of the 8th school district [a prestigious school district in Seoul] weakened, leading young parents to flock to the Seocho area, which has relatively better residential environment.\\n\\nPark Pil-dong, aide to Saenuri Party Rep. Kim Hoe-sun of Seocho-Gap, said, \\\"The reconstruction impact isn't significant yet, but as more reconstruction progresses in the constituency and influx of young people with opposition tendencies increases, ruling party support will decline in the future,\\\" adding \\\"This seems to be partially reflected in this survey.\\\" He also added, \\\"It could be because young people have high expectations for Ahn's new party.\\\"\\n\\nLooking by generation, this analysis gains more weight. This survey shows people in their 20s (including 19-year-olds) and 30s support Ahn's new party more than the Saenuri Party. Particularly, 30s support was nearly double that of the Saenuri Party.\\n\\nWhy Women?\\nIn the last presidential election, women supported candidate Park Geun-hye more. However, this survey shows women's support rate is higher for Ahn's new party than the Saenuri Party. While men support the Saenuri Party by nearly double, women's support rate is the opposite. Ahn's new party leads by 12.9 percentage points.\\n\\nAmong 8 women in their 20s-30s living in this area that Gangnam Tongshin met, 5 were favorable toward Ahn's new party. Among these, 1 person said they would unconditionally vote if Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo himself runs in this June 4th local election, and 1 person said they would vote if a candidate who somewhat meets expectations is nominated. Two were favorable but reserved their choice. The remaining 1 person said they support but have no intention of voting.\\n\\nOffice worker Ms. Kim (33, female, Bangbae-dong) said, \\\"Women in their 20s-30s who used to accept their parents' recommendations gained their own political identity through Ahn Cheol-soo.\\\" She explained that after obediently listening to parents who vote based on regional origins like Yeongnam and Honam and even impose their political views on their children, Ahn Cheol-soo's emergence made them rebel against their parents. His appearances on TV entertainment programs to build a friendly image played a role. Ms. Kim said, \\\"Seeing him on broadcasts, unlike existing politicians, he seemed unpretentious and I came to expect he would represent our generation's position well.\\\"\\n\\nDr. Yoon (39, female, Banpo-dong) cited \\\"disliking both Saenuri Party and Democratic Party\\\" as her reason. She said, \\\"I once supported minor opposition parties like Democratic Labor Party candidate Kwon Young-gil,\\\" adding \\\"I support them because I dislike the ruling and opposition parties, but I felt rejection because they were too biased, but I expect Ahn Cheol-soo to be different.\\\" However, whether this support will continue to local elections is uncertain, as most people who say they expect something from Ahn's new party express conditional support, saying \\\"I'll watch a bit more.\\\"\\n\\nPolitical Apathy... Concerns of 'Blind Voting' Without Nominations\\nThis opinion poll reveals another important implication beyond the fact that Gangnam's three districts, the Saenuri Party's stronghold, are shaking: deepening political apathy, especially near-ignorance-level indifference toward local government heads.\\n\\nThis survey asked about voting behavior in two different ways. When asked which candidate they would vote for in this June 4th local election, 37.6% said they would look at the person. However, when asked more specifically what they consider most important when choosing a district head, the answers changed. Responses about looking at the person, including character and ability, were only 8.8% (character 6.8% + ability 2%), while political career (39.5%), party affiliation (32%), and regional connections (12.8%) were considered important. This didn't vary much by gender or age. However, people in their 20s valued the person (13.9%, character 11.4% + ability 2.5%) more than regional connections (8.9%). Interestingly, nobody really considered ability an important factor. Only people in their 60s had a relatively high 4.3% response for ability, while other age groups were in the 1-2% range. While people say they vote based on the person, they don't really expect much from district heads.\\n\\nPerhaps for this reason, not many people knew who their district head was. In all three Gangnam districts, only about 3-4 out of 10 remembered the name. Even among those who said they remembered, quite a few wrote the name incorrectly when asked to write it down.\\n\\nAmong 10 Gangnam district voters that Gangnam Tongshin met, only 1 person remembered their current district head's name. It wasn't simply forgetting - many cases involved complete ignorance. Even when told the name, they answered \\\"I've never heard of them.\\\" The one person who knew the name had personal experience meeting the district head. If they don't even know who the current district head is, they inevitably have even less interest in information about candidates who will run. When asked to write memorable names among expected candidates for this June 4th local election, nearly 9 out of 10 (86.8%) said they didn't know. In Gangnam-gu, 3.8% each mentioned current district head Shin Yeon-hui and former Gangnam district head Maeng Jeong-ju. Other autonomous districts were similar. Current district heads Jin Ik-cheol of Seocho-gu and Park Chun-hui of Songpa-gu were mentioned by 6.4% and 2.3% respectively. While there's an incumbent premium, this is more of a party effect than individual recognition.\\n\\nTherefore, if party nominations for local government heads were abolished as political circles had pursued, similar candidates with similar tendencies would proliferate like in provincial education superintendent elections, likely leading to blind voting. On the other hand, since nominations determine election outcomes to this extent, there's also the possibility that candidates might make desperate moves to receive nominations.\\n\\nListening to 20s-30s with Low Voter Turnout\\n\\nOffice worker Ms. Park (32, female, Yeoksam-dong)\\n\\\"I'm not interested in politics. I voted for whoever my parents told me to vote for. Most were Saenuri Party candidates. Nothing much changes regardless of who wins. I have expectations for Ahn Cheol-soo's new party (hereafter Ahn's new party). I don't know if it will meet expectations. Actually, it's similar to former President Roh Moo-hyun's time. I voted for Lee Hoi-chang due to parental pressure but had expectations for Roh Moo-hyun. But it ended up being the same. Seoul mayor, Gangnam district head? I can't remember. (※When told Park Won-soon and Shin Yeon-hui) Oh, right. Park Won-soon. Shin Yeon-hui is a name I'm hearing for the first time.\\\"\\n\\nHagwon instructor Ms. Lee (32, female, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry])\\n\\\"I support the Democratic Party. Party is more important than the person. Maybe because my parents' hometown is Jeolla Province [a region traditionally supporting liberal parties] and I was indoctrinated from childhood, I just support them. I'll definitely vote for Park Won-soon for Seoul mayor. Regarding Ahn's new party, seeing the candidate concession during the 2011 Seoul mayoral by-election, I felt a freshness not seen in existing politicians. That action alone had meaning. Afterwards, with stock issues and other suspicions continuously emerging, I was disappointed, but I think he's the best among politicians. I'm not supporting Ahn's new party in this local election because there's no concrete evidence yet. There's only circumstantial belief that something will be different. Gangnam district head? I don't know who that is.\\\"\\n\\nDesigner Ms. Hong (32, female, Gaepo-dong)\\n\\\"I'm not interested in politics. I won't vote in the June 4th local election. I've never heard anyone around me except my parents talk politics. Whether it's Saenuri Party or Democratic Party, life is always hard. Until my late 20s, I carefully examined candidates and pledges expecting something would change, but not one person has met my expectations so far. In the last presidential election, I reluctantly voted for Park Geun-hye due to my parents' nagging. So I decided not to vote this year. Seoul mayor? I don't know who that is. (※When told Park Won-soon) Oh, I remember. I voted for him too. My family pressured me to vote for Na Kyung-won, but I stuck to my conviction. But there wasn't a single policy that helped ordinary people's lives. Gangnam district head? I don't know. (※When told Shin Yeon-hui) I still don't know. The only party I'm pinning hopes on is Ahn's new party. Haven't they walked a different path from other politicians who only fight among themselves? But I don't support them unconditionally. I'm watching. If Ahn Cheol-soo disappoints me like Park Won-soon did, I think I'll never vote for the rest of my life. Ahn's new party is my last hope. My parents criticize that a person who doesn't know the first thing about politics is deluding young people. They also ask what he's accomplished. I have no words to refute that.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertising design company CEO Mr. Bae (39, male, Banpo-dong)\\n\\\"I support the Saenuri Party. Because of Lee Hye-hoon. I've known her since she was a Seocho-gu National Assembly member. Regardless of political orientation, she seems like a person who makes sense. I supported Ahn Cheol-soo when he said he'd run for president. But not anymore. He's been in politics for 3 years now. His support rate was higher than the Democratic Party's. But I don't know what he's done. So I returned to the Saenuri Party. Seocho district head? I know him. I've met him personally for business. Before meeting him, I had no interest in who he was. In this local election, I'll look at the person. I'll vote for someone I've had prior connections with. If there's no such person, I'll naturally vote for the Saenuri Party candidate. Same for Seoul mayor. Most Gangnam people are establishment, so it's natural that many support the Saenuri Party. Of course, there are exceptions. Mayor Oh Se-hoon. He spent money [tax money] here and there. After Park Won-soon became mayor, many people liked him. Even if it's Saenuri Party, someone who doesn't spend money at all is better than someone who spends a lot of money (taxes). Regardless of party, I don't like money going out of my pocket.\\\"\\n\\nOffice worker Mr. Hong (30, male, Jamwon-dong)\\n\\\"I support Ahn's new party. In the last presidential election, my parents voted for Park Geun-hye but I voted for Moon Jae-in. Honestly, Ahn's new party has achieved no results so far. They have no power. But just the fact that Ahn Cheol-soo's life is different from existing politicians is reason enough to support them. It's because of expectations for new politics. Even if Ahn's new party candidates win as Seoul mayor or district head, nothing will change immediately. But that's exactly why young people should support and cheer them more. But there are conditions. No matter how much it's an Ahn's new party candidate, I'll only vote for someone with reasonable qualifications. It's not unconditional support. Current Seocho district head? I don't know who that is.\\\"\\n\\nBank employee Ms. Bae (31, female, Banpo-dong)\\n\\\"I support the Saenuri Party. Every administration and party has pros and cons. The Saenuri Party seems to have done better than other parties. Not everyone living in Gangnam is rich. But during the Roh Moo-hyun administration, even to people who don't know politics, there were clearly problems with tax and real estate policies. My perception of the Saenuri Party isn't good. But it seems like it would be somewhat more helpful. Ahn Cheol-soo seems to be making desperate moves. I don't support him. Current Seocho district head? I don't know who that is. In this election, I'll choose the Saenuri Party no matter who.\\\"\\n\\nOffice worker Ms. Kim (33, female, Bangbae-dong)\\n\\\"I made plans to travel on June 4th election day. I'm not interested in politics, but after marriage, my preference for the Saenuri Party has increased. Tax policies and real estate policies better match my situation. Opposition parties only increase tax burden. During the Seoul mayoral by-election, I supported Park Won-soon. After his election, when he cancelled New Town [urban development projects], I suffered big losses on investments. When it negatively affects my life, my evaluation of the person changes too. I actively support Ahn's new party. If Ahn Cheol-soo runs as Seoul mayor candidate, I'm thinking of voting and then going on vacation. Seeing him on TV entertainment programs, he seemed unpretentious and I gained faith that he would represent our generation's position. My husband and parents all support the Saenuri Party. Seocho district head? I don't know who that is. In the last election, I probably just voted looking at the party.\\\"\\n\\nOffice worker Ms. Yoon (34, female, Jamwon-dong)\\n\\\"My parents support the Saenuri Party, maybe because their hometown is Gangwon Province [a region leaning conservative]. I don't have a party I support. There are many progressive-leaning people around me, but having no interest in politics represents conservative tendencies. For Seoul mayor, I'll probably vote for Park Won-soon. Nothing memorable, but nothing bad either. When Ahn Cheol-soo entered politics, I had high expectations. But I was disappointed by subsequent events. Seeing his indecisive appearance, unable to properly decide whether to do something or not, my trust declined.\\\"\\n\\nDoctor Ms. Yoon (39, female, Banpo-dong)\\n\\\"My parents support the Saenuri Party because they're from Gyeongsang Province [a region traditionally supporting conservative parties]. I don't like either Saenuri or Democratic parties. My parents will pressure me, but I'll vote looking at the person. In the Seoul mayoral by-election, I voted for Park Won-soon, and in the presidential election for Moon Jae-in. I don't remember the district head, but I probably voted for the candidate opposing the Saenuri Party. Regardless of election results, it's meaningful to give a warning to the ruling party. Ahn's new party will be a new alternative. I have expectations. Maybe because I'm a doctor, I like the path he's walked. Seocho district head? I don't know who that is. In this June 4th local election, I'll carefully examine the candidate Ahn's new party puts forward. If the person is really not good, I'll choose the Democratic Party candidate.\\\"\\n\\nTraditional Korean medicine doctor Ms. Kim (27, female, Garak-dong)\\n\\\"I don't have a fixed party I support. In the last presidential election, I supported Hong Se-hwa's party (※Progressive Party, now Labor Party). I dislike the Saenuri Party because they seem to only represent establishment interests, and I had no expectations for the Democratic Party from the beginning. Ahn's new party seems to depend only on Ahn Cheol-soo alone. Not only is it unverified, but I don't know what they consider important. There's no substance. For Seoul mayor, I'll choose Park Won-soon. Although he's Democratic Party affiliated, I see him as separate from the Democratic Party. Current Songpa district head? I don't know who that is. I'll vote looking at candidates, but not Saenuri Party.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9118, "output_tokens": 4822, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

First introduced for 1994 academic year college admissions, a total of 23 tests have been administered through the 2015 academic year CSAT held on the 13th of last month. The first test-takers from the class of '94 are now 39 years old, while those entering university this year as the class of 2014 are 19. In other words, today's 'twenties and thirties generation' is the 'CSAT generation.'\\n\\nOur era's youth have passed through their prime years overcoming the barrier called 'CSAT.' The Youth Report team tracked those who passed through this life gateway most brilliantly. They are the top scorers who achieved first place nationwide on the CSAT.\\n\\nFrom the 1994 to 2015 academic years, approximately 15.8 million people took the CSAT. Among these, we were able to identify 45 CSAT top scorers combining humanities and science tracks. By CSAT scores, they belong to approximately 0.001% of South Korea's population—true prodigies. Did these youth who achieved top CSAT scores also reach first place in life? Here we present a vivid report tracking the lives of these 'gods of studying.'\\n\\nJeong Gang-hyeon, Youth Report Team Leader\\n\\n\\\"What are those brilliant CSAT first-place winners doing now?\\\"\\n\\nHowever, tracking them was not easy. Since the 2000 academic year, there have been no official announcements about top scorers. The Youth Report team began tracking based on private college admissions hagwon announcements and media reports. We ultimately identified a total of 45 CSAT top scorers (24 humanities, 21 science). We excluded the 2001 academic year CSAT and 2005 academic year humanities CSAT, which produced more than 20 perfect scorers, and the 2008 academic year, for which raw CSAT scores were not released.\\n\\nThe Youth Report team first conducted a survey targeting these individuals. Twenty-seven responded to the survey. We conducted in-depth interviews with five either in person or by phone.\\n\\nContrary to expectations, the lives of CSAT top scorers were somewhat conventional. While they could be considered South Korea's top brains in terms of academics alone, the life paths they chose were rather predictable. Seoul National University accounted for the absolute majority at 85% (38 people) of their university choices. After university graduation, most humanities top scorers became legal professionals, while most science top scorers became doctors.\\n\\n**Science Track Shows Medical School Concentration After Financial Crisis**\\n\\nThere were some differences by era. Science track top scorers were clearly divided based on the 2000 academic year. Science top scorers from 1994-99 academic years chose pure science and engineering fields. They entered Seoul National University's physics or electrical and electronic engineering departments, completed master's and doctoral degrees in the United States, and are currently working as researchers. Notably, the 1994, 1995, and 1996 academic year top scorers reportedly studied together at Stanford University in the United States. Currently, the 1994 academic year top scorer works as a researcher at Apple, the 1996 academic year top scorer at Samsung's U.S. branch, and the 1997 academic year top scorer at a government research institute. The 1999 academic year top scorer is a researcher at Harvard University. The 1995 academic year top scorer, Jeong Seong-taek (38), is operating a venture company in Silicon Valley, U.S.\\n\\nThey said, \\\"What we learned during U.S. studies was more helpful in life than education in Korea.\\\" The 1997 class top scorer working at a government research institute said, \\\"If I could go back to when I achieved CSAT top score, I would go to the U.S. for studies to get more opportunities.\\\"\\n\\nScience top scorers from the 2000s onward chose the medical profession in absolute majority. Of the 16 top scorers since the 2000 academic year, 13 entered medical or dental schools, excluding 3 (2 Seoul National University mathematics majors, 1 Seoul National University liberal arts major). One of them entered Seoul National University's science and engineering college in the late 1990s but retook the CSAT in the mid-2000s and entered Seoul National University medical school.\\n\\nHumanities top scorers' career paths divided between law and business administration before and after law school introduction in 2009. From 1994 to 2008 academic years, 11 of 14 people entered Seoul National University law school. The remaining 3 entered Seoul National University economics/business administration and Yonsei University business administration respectively. Eight of the 11 became legal professionals, and 1 changed course to enter graduate medical school. Two who entered law school but are not in legal profession registries have unconfirmed current occupations. In contrast, since law school introduction from the 2009 academic year onward, humanities top scorers showed a clear concentration toward business administration. Of 10 top scorers since the 2009 academic year, 8 chose business administration (6 Seoul National University, 2 Yonsei University).\\n\\n**Many from Middle Class and Above, Clear 'Educational Inheritance'**\\n\\nMany CSAT top scorers came from middle-class backgrounds or above. Investigation of their residence when taking the CSAT showed Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] 3-gu (Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa) had the most with 6 people. Parents' occupations were ▶doctors/pharmacists (9 people) ▶professors/teachers (8 people) ▶legal professionals (4 people) in that order. Twenty-two answered that their parents' economic level was upper 50% (middle class) or above. In contrast, only 2 top scorers answered lower 30%. They said their parents' occupations were street vendor and construction worker.\\n\\nThere was also clear concentration in high school backgrounds. Thirty came from special purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools, while only 15 came from regular high schools. Jeonju Sangsan High School (5 people) and Daewon Foreign Language High School (3 people) produced the most top scorers in that order.\\n\\n**Current Life Satisfaction: 7 out of 10 Points**\\n\\nMany responded that the title of 'CSAT top scorer' acted as a burden in life. Top scorers' current life and job satisfaction averaged 7 out of 10 points. The 2010 academic year humanities top scorer Mr. A said, \\\"After becoming CSAT top scorer, the pressure was great to produce excellent results in all aspects including university grades.\\\"\\n\\nLee Ju-hee, professor of sociology at Ewha Womans University, evaluated this as \\\"results that directly reveal the reality of worsening educational inheritance when looking at top scorers' family economic power.\\\" Professor Lee also said, \\\"It's unexpected that top scorers' life and job satisfaction is only at average level,\\\" adding \\\"This appears to be because while they chose stable jobs, their intellectual desires were not fulfilled.\\\"\\n\\nReporters Lee Seo-jun and Yoon Jeong-min\\n\\n**5 People Speak About Life and Concerns After CSAT Top Score**\\n\\n**Trust and Cooperation Learned at U.S. University Becomes Foundation for Silicon Valley Startup**\\n**1995 Academic Year Jeong Seong-taek**\\n\\n1995 academic year science top scorer Jeong Seong-taek (38, Seoul National University electrical and electronic engineering graduate) also graduated university at the top of his class early. After completing master's and doctoral degrees at Stanford University in the U.S. and working at a consulting company, he founded IT venture company 'HumanBest' in Silicon Valley two years ago. He operates software that supports efficient Facebook advertising, such as allowing users to see only ads recommended by friends. It's one of the few companies in the U.S. with access to Facebook's advertising list. Jeong was also president of the venture company that developed the mobile browser app 'Dolphin Browser,' which has been downloaded over 50 million times worldwide.\\n\\nHe said, \\\"If it weren't for Silicon Valley, I probably wouldn't have even thought about starting a business,\\\" adding \\\"For startups, trust and cooperation are more important than financial support.\\\" Jeong said Silicon Valley has a culture of Gentleman's NDA (trust-based non-disclosure agreements). This differs from typical corporate culture where legal teams document everything and legal disputes are frequent. He said, \\\"The Park Geun-hye government promotes creative economy, but I'm concerned it might end as exhibition administration focused only on financial support.\\\"\\n\\nWhen asked to rank 'the order of what played major roles in achieving success,' he ranked U.S. society 4th. Korean society was 7th. He received startup funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Stanford University. Jeong said, \\\"I don't have negative feelings toward Korean society, but it's true that what I studied in the U.S. helped more in doing venture business.\\\" He then criticized our society: \\\"The entrance exam hell isn't created by difficult CSATs, but by a society where you can only survive by clinging to CSAT. If you eliminate discrimination to stop inhumane competition, inhumane competition will break out elsewhere.\\\"\\n\\n**Stimulation from Companies Experiencing Financial Crisis**\\n**International Litigation Specialist Lawyer Activities**\\n**2002 Academic Year Yoon Seok-jun**\\n\\n2002 academic year CSAT humanities top scorer Yoon Seok-jun (32, Seoul National University law graduate) cited 'family support' when asked 'what played the biggest role in achieving success.'\\n\\nWhat kind of support did Yoon's parents, who are school teachers, provide? Yoon gave a surprising answer: \\\"They never looked at my report card in front of me and never asked for my report card.\\\" He says he never heard \\\"study\\\" from his parents either. His parents continuously threw 'stimulation' rather than 'pressure' at Yoon.\\n\\n\\\"We traveled a lot when I was young. A week before traveling, my parents told me to find out information about where we were going myself. Subjects like 'Korean Geography' were easy to study based on what I researched then.\\\"\\n\\nYoon attended hagwons for only one month throughout his school years. He said he received benefits beyond what hagwon education could provide at his local non-equalized high school (Namseong High School in Iksan, North Jeolla Province). Yoon said, \\\"Students who studied well gathered together so I received a lot of stimulation, and the teachers also had strong will.\\\"\\n\\nHe also said, \\\"Now career consultants in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area cost millions of won [approximately $2,000-8,000 USD], but I received similar support in high school,\\\" adding \\\"There were times to interview lawyers and give presentations.\\\" In his senior year of high school, classes were conducted using famous repeat test-taker hagwon [hagwons for students retaking CSAT after high school graduation] materials and mock exams.\\n\\nYoon entered high school in 1998, right after the financial crisis. Seeing domestic companies being sold to foreign capital, he dreamed of becoming an international litigation lawyer. Currently, Yoon is an international litigation specialist lawyer with Taepyeong Law Firm, representing South Korea against private equity fund Lone Star, which faces 'eat and run' [taking profits and leaving] controversies.\\n\\n**Became Doctor Following Father's Advice, But Also Studies Law of Personal Interest**\\n**2005 Academic Year Son Jeong-gu**\\n\\n\\\"I confess. I'm a 'Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] kid.' I received a lot of hagwon education.\\\"\\n\\n2005 academic year CSAT science top scorer Son Jeong-gu (30, Yonsei University dental school graduate) made this 'confession.' So we had to ask directly.\\n\\n-So you're saying CSAT top score was thanks to hagwon education?\\n\\n\\\"Haha. That's not what I'm saying.... Hagwon education guarantees mock exam scores. But it absolutely cannot do that for CSAT.\\\" Son's confession had a reason. Son is a three-time test-taker. He achieved top score on his third CSAT attempt. Out of 500 points, he got one 2-point question wrong.\\n\\nBut even he failed all schools he applied to on his first CSAT. The second test wasn't great either. Son said he \\\"discovered himself relying only on hagwon education\\\" at that time. Before his third CSAT, Son quit all private hagwons. Instead, he began writing only textbook outlines in notebooks and organizing what he understood versus didn't understand. Son said, \\\"I realized the limits of hagwon education and what real studying was during my third attempt. I started real studying—my own studying of trying to understand and organizing alone—only then.\\\"\\n\\nDuring school years, Son dreamed of entering finance following his father. But his father recommended medical school. Son said, \\\"My father recommended getting a stable job first, then studying what I wanted to do, so I followed that advice.\\\"\\n\\nSon's life after CSAT has been a series of challenges. He is currently 'a dentist who is a law school student on leave with an economics degree.' During public health service, he obtained an economics degree from Korea National Open University and started studying law through academic credit bank system legal studies, eventually passing Seoul National University Law School last year. He currently operates a dental clinic in Seocho-dong, Seoul with acquaintances. He said, \\\"Taking CSAT three times was an opportunity to learn 'real studying.'\\\"\\n\\n**CSAT Is Just a Process for University Admission... Concerns Continue Even After Becoming Lawyer**\\n**2006 Academic Year Park Ji-won**\\n\\n\\\"CSAT was just a process for entering university, not something that occupies an important influence in life as people think.\\\"\\n\\nPark Ji-won (27), who achieved nationwide top score by getting only one question wrong on the 2006 academic year CSAT, made this surprising statement. In a society where 'CSAT = life success' is considered the correct answer, such words from a CSAT top scorer's mouth....\\n\\nWhile having these complex thoughts, Park made an even stronger statement.\\n\\n\\\"High school education wasn't very helpful for CSAT or life. If it was just to do well on CSAT, it would have been better to finish studies with GED [General Educational Development test] and enter university early by studying only for CSAT.\\\"\\n\\n-You seem very disappointed in public education, but how did you achieve top score?\\n\\n\\\"Because among things you can do at high school age, CSAT studying was the most cost-effective, so I just studied faithfully.\\\"\\n\\nPark switched from science to humanities track in his senior year. His father, who was a medical school professor, expected Park to also become a doctor, but he was more interested in law or social sciences. Career concerns continued even after entering university. Park said, \\\"CSAT success allowed me to get into a good school, so I felt less fundamental pressure about 'making a living,' but 'what to do to make a living' was still a big concern.\\\"\\n\\nHe eventually chose the bar exam and became a lawyer. After completing military service as a public interest legal officer, he plans to open a law office and get married. Though he conquered CSAT, new challenges still pile up. He said, \\\"I'm very interested in public roles like civic organization activities,\\\" adding \\\"How to lead the office and how I can return the benefits I've gained to our society are also concerns.\\\"\\n\\n**Worried More About 'Ruined Perfect Scorer' Talk Than Venture Startup Failure Burden**\\n**2013 Academic Year Lee Seung-gyu**\\n\\n'What should I do with my life going forward?' This is the biggest concern of Lee Seung-gyu (20, Seoul National University College of Liberal Studies), a 2013 academic year CSAT perfect scorer. Wanting to become a brain scientist, he chose the College of Liberal Studies where he could freely arrange classes instead of law or business administration. But now he's also interested in artificial intelligence technology and economics, and has joined a startup club.\\n\\nWhat weighs on him amid career concerns is the title 'CSAT perfect scorer.' He hesitates to make career decisions according to his convictions, like venture startups, because of the burden this title brings. He worries that if he doesn't take a path our society recognizes as 'success,' there will be talk that he 'fell apart after CSAT.' Lee said, \\\"CSAT scores only determined university admission and don't guarantee everything,\\\" adding \\\"Now I need to accomplish something.\\\"\\n\\nBut CSAT top score didn't remain only as a burden. Lee, who attended a regular high school (Daegu Daeryun High School), conquered CSAT through effort alone. He was so intense that he stuck notes on walls to study while waiting for apartment elevators because the time seemed wasteful. Thanks to this, he became a senior who gave hope to juniors in his hometown Daegu that 'you can do it even if you're not from Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] or special purpose high schools.'\\n\\nWe also asked Lee, who took CSAT relatively recently, about controversies surrounding CSAT. Lee pointed out, \\\"EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] correlation actually resulted in encouraging hagwon education,\\\" adding \\\"Also, excessively easy CSAT means getting even one wrong can greatly change acceptance/rejection, only increasing test-takers' psychological burden.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the interview, Lee repeatedly said, \\\"I need to forget CSAT results.\\\" This read as determination not to shrink under the burden of being CSAT top scorer or remain in the past intoxicated by glory.\\n\\nReporters Lee Seo-jun and Yoon Jeong-min\\n\\n**21 Years of CSAT Stained by Difficulty Controversies**\\n\\nThe College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) was introduced promoting 'evaluating thinking ability instead of memorization.' The first test, the 1994 academic year 1st CSAT, was held on August 20, 1993. In the first year, tests were conducted twice in August and November, but complaints of 'entrance exam hell' erupted, so from the following year only one test was administered.\\n\\nCSAT repeatedly failed in 'difficulty control.' 1997 is considered the worst 'difficult CSAT' (high-difficulty CSAT), causing frustration for countless test-takers. As difficulty subsequently decreased, 2001 academic year produced a whopping 66 perfect scorers. Yoon Seok-jun (32, 2012 academic year top scorer), who took CSAT then, said, \\\"There was talk that you couldn't even apply to Seoul National University if you got even one or two wrong.\\\"\\n\\nThe following year, 2002 academic year, difficulty was greatly increased again, but only created greater chaos. The aftermath continued with students collectively absent from school after being shocked by preliminary scoring results.\\n\\nIn 2004 academic year, the first grading error was discovered, with multiple correct answers recognized for Korean language section question 17. Multiple correct answers were also recognized in 2008, 2010, and 2014 academic years, and this year errors occurred in Life Science II and English, leading to the resignation of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation president.\\n\\nSince 2005 academic year, CSAT faced major changes. Students could choose desired areas, and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media]-linked questions began being produced. EBS linkage production ratio currently maintains 70%, but criticism emerges that hagwon education reduction effects are small and only lower question quality.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9580, "output_tokens": 4776, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is the first image that comes to mind when people think of aircraft cabin crew members (hereinafter referred to as flight attendants). Because they treat passengers with elegant appearance and graceful speech, they are called 'flowers of the sky,' but in 2013, the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training identified flight attendants as the occupation that suffers most from emotional labor in their 'Survey on the Status of Emotional Labor by Occupation.' This is why flight attendants are often compared to swans. Just as swans that appear peaceful on the surface constantly paddle underwater to stay afloat, behind the elegant appearance of flight attendants lies sweat and effort to provide proper service to passengers. Many teenagers vaguely admire flight attendants without knowing exactly what they do, looking only at their glamorous exterior. We investigated what exactly flight attendants do and what capabilities they need to possess.\\n\\nSenior Flight Attendant Who Saved Dozens by Carrying Them on Her Back\\n'Bang.' July 6, 2013 (local time) at San Francisco Airport in the United States. An Asiana Airlines passenger plane crash-landed, killing 3 out of 307 passengers and injuring 180. The reason it didn't lead to a bigger accident was because the cabin crew at the time spared no effort in rescue operations, including female crew members carrying passengers on their backs and running. In particular, Lee Yun-hye, Asiana Airlines' most senior flight attendant (cabin service manager) who was the chief person in charge of the cabin, helped the captain extinguish fires with fire extinguishers while evacuating remaining passengers, paying no heed to the fire that broke out at the back of the aircraft, and only got off the plane after confirming that all passengers had evacuated. Her actions became known domestically and internationally, deeply moving many people. At a press conference held at the time, she said, 'My body moved on its own and I began the procedures necessary for escape' and 'I had no thoughts other than saving the passengers.'\\n\\nThis is a good example showing that flight attendants don't just provide in-flight services but also perform life-saving missions. Taking responsibility for passenger safety is the most important role of flight attendants. They must calmly help passengers evacuate in emergency situations such as plane crashes or emergency landings that might occur. Just as Lee Yun-hye experienced her first emergency situation in 18 years of flying experience, no one knows when, where, or what might happen, so a constant state of preparedness is necessary.\\n\\nHowever, preparing for emergency situations through one or two training sessions is not easy. This is why each airline helps prepare for emergency evacuations through consistent annual training. Asiana Airlines flight attendants must complete 189 hours of initial safety training covering 23 subjects as new employees, and once a year they receive regular training for over 14 hours covering 8 subjects including emergency evacuation, fire suppression, safety procedures, and first aid. They are so thoroughly evaluated that those who fail regular exams taken every 12 months three or more times must resign. Park So-hee, an Asiana Airlines senior flight attendant, said, 'Through this training, we overcome fear of flight accidents, and when we encounter news of aircraft accidents, the first thing we think of is \\\"how would I have responded in that situation?\\\"'\\n\\nNo Time to Rest Even for a Second Until Takeoff\\nThe work flight attendants do is broadly divided into before and after takeoff, and during flight. The work begins with a cabin briefing where crew members gather under the leadership of the cabin service manager, who is the chief person in charge of the aircraft cabin, to confirm the aircraft type, takeoff and landing times, passenger reservation status, etc., for that day's flight and divide roles. Although the time and location vary slightly by airline, international flights gather at the airport or headquarters 2 hours and 20 minutes before boarding time, and domestic flights 1 hour and 10 minutes before. Park Sang-ah, an Asiana Airlines senior flight attendant, said, 'We prepare for flight by checking services and safety conditions long before passengers board,' and 'When I was new and lacked overall knowledge about aircraft, I had to come 2-3 hours earlier than briefing time to familiarize myself with the aircraft's internal structure.'\\n\\nAfter the cabin briefing and joint briefing led by the captain, full-scale takeoff preparation begins. They check whether there are any problems with cabin facilities and determine whether fire extinguishers, first aid supplies, and automated external defibrillators are properly equipped. A process of checking whether in-flight meals and duty-free items are loaded according to passenger numbers and requirements is also necessary. Park Hyo-sun, Jin Air Line 1 Team Leader, said, 'Even if we took off without loading passengers' meals, we can't change the flight path and return,' and 'Especially if we forget first aid kits, we might not be able to respond properly in emergency situations, putting passengers in danger, so thorough preparation and inspection are necessary in advance.'\\n\\nAfter completing preparations and passenger boarding, the aircraft moves to the runway for takeoff preparation, at which time guidance on emergency equipment use is provided. They show videos or flight attendants directly inform about seatbelt usage, emergency exit locations, oxygen mask locations and usage methods. Team Leader Park Hyo-sun said, 'From cabin briefing until takeoff, there's no time to rest even for a second,' and 'In places passengers don't see, there are many times when we run around sweating as if our feet are on fire.'\\n\\nWhen the aircraft begins takeoff, flight attendants also fasten their seatbelts and sit in crew chairs called jump seats. This is the first time they can take a breather since starting work, but even then they don't just sit still and rest. They must continuously recall emergency exit locations and operation methods, emergency equipment locations and operation methods, and emergency evacuation procedures in their minds. Song Su-eun, a Jin Air In-flight Safety Service Team employee, said, 'This is called the \\\"Thirty Seconds Review\\\"' and 'Since accidents are most likely to occur during takeoff and landing, we must be more alert than ever and be ready to respond immediately if an emergency situation occurs.'\\n\\nWhen the aircraft takes off, reaches safe altitude, and the seatbelt sign turns off, full-scale in-flight service begins. This includes providing beverages and in-flight meals and selling duty-free items. Usually two flight attendants are responsible for one cart, and after meals they also provide desserts like coffee and tea and immigration forms to passengers. The number of in-flight meal services varies by scheduled flight time. The principle is to provide once for flights under 6 hours, twice for flights over 6 hours, and three times for flights over 12 hours. Additionally, they must clean restrooms periodically and accommodate passenger requests. When they arrive at their destination and all passengers have gotten off the plane, the flight attendants' work is completed.\\n\\nAsiana Starting Salary 40 Million Won [approximately $30,000 USD] Annually, 70 Flight Tickets Provided\\nMany people prefer to become flight attendants not only because they can travel to various countries around the world, but also because of high salary levels and various welfare benefits. Although there are slight differences depending on flight hours, Asiana Airlines typically provides a starting salary of 40 million won [approximately $30,000 USD] annually and 70 airplane tickets per year that can be used free of charge by the employee, spouse, parents, spouse's parents, and children. Senior Flight Attendant Park So-hee said, 'Usually international flights often involve staying overseas for 1-2 days before returning,' and 'I've been to over 20 cities just because of flights so far.'\\n\\nHowever, there are equally many difficult aspects. Following flight schedules inevitably leads to irregular living. Flight attendants usually receive their schedules one or two months in advance. On a monthly basis, they usually fly 80 hours and rest 8 days. When making long-distance flights to the Americas or Europe, they inevitably become exhausted. Senior Flight Attendant Park Sang-ah said, 'Usually when flying for more than 10 hours, we're supposed to take turns resting for 2 hours each, but even when rest time is given, we can't sleep properly on the plane because the tension doesn't ease.'\\n\\nEating meals on time during flight is also impossible. While they provide passengers with bright smiles and warm food as top-quality service, the flight attendants themselves frequently eat their meals in 3-4 minutes or divide one meal into 3-4 portions. Also, they can only use restrooms after all passengers have used them, so many flight attendants suffer from diseases like cystitis.\\n\\nBut the most difficult thing is having to smile while hiding one's emotions when dealing with people. Also, there are many times when they must bow their heads and apologize to passengers even when it's not the flight attendant's fault. Employee Song Su-eun said, 'When flights are delayed due to weather or aircraft defects, many people start by yelling at flight attendants,' and 'Although there are many times when it feels unfair, thinking that one word or attitude from a flight attendant determines the airline's image, we can't respond carelessly even to passengers' unreasonable complaints.'\\n\\nHeight Restrictions in Cabin Crew Hiring Gradually Disappearing\\nFlight attendants unanimously say, 'You can't endure this job without considerable mental strength.' It's hard enough to serve customers while maintaining tension for as long as over 20 hours in the special situation of flight, but various 'problem passengers' make flight attendants' work even more difficult. Team Leader Park Hyo-sun said, 'You must become a true multi-player.' You must approach crying children as a mother figure, and when passengers cause disturbances in the cabin, you must become a police officer capable of restraining them. Also, when emergency situations occur, you must become a rescue worker who risks your own safety for passenger safety.\\n\\nMost importantly, strong physical strength is crucial. No matter how outstandingly beautiful one's appearance or how good one's service, if you don't build physical strength, you can't endure. Senior Flight Attendant Park So-hee still jogs along the Han River or plays tennis 3-4 days a week, and even when staying overseas, she always finds the accommodation fitness center to exercise. She said, 'No matter how attractive you find this work, if you hit physical limits, you're bound to collapse,' and 'You must build basic physical strength through exercise.'\\n\\nForeign language ability is essential. The English proficiency test scores required by airlines are TOEIC 550-600 points, but to serve foreign passengers during flights, you need to develop communication skills sufficient for conversation in English without difficulty. Also, you must be able to get along well with others. Due to work characteristics, you often work with new people and frequently share rooms with people you don't know well overseas. Senior Flight Attendant Park Sang-ah said, 'People who have difficulty getting along with others or have picky and sensitive personalities are not suitable for flight attendants,' and 'You must have a round personality without rough edges to work long-term.'\\n\\nWhile physical conditions including appearance were previously evaluated as important, nowadays most airlines are eliminating height restrictions. It's generally known that having an arm reach (the length when standing on tiptoes and stretching arms straight up) exceeding 220cm is sufficient. This is because there should be no difficulty putting items in and taking them out of overhead compartments above passengers' heads to perform duties without hindrance. Thorough self-management is basic. Flight attendants generally prohibit drinking within 12 hours, diving within 24 hours, and blood transfusion within 72 hours before flight duty.\\n\\nCareer Expert's View of This Occupation: Bright Prospects as Tourists Increase\\nAircraft cabin crew is an occupation many women aspire to. Compared to other jobs, the salary level is high, various welfare benefits are guaranteed, and social reputation is good. There are also many opportunities for self-development. Even after resignation, being able to continue service-related work at hotels or travel agencies as hagwon instructors training flight attendants by utilizing this experience is also an advantage. However, there are equally many difficult aspects. Recently, as in-flight disturbance incidents and verbal abuse cases have been frequently reported in the media, the work hardships of aircraft cabin crew have begun receiving social attention. Also, working hours are irregular, and physical exhaustion is significant due to in-flight service and long-distance flights. Many people have occupational diseases such as insomnia, stomach problems, and herniated discs. Future prospects are bright. With the implementation of the five-day work week, leisure time has increased, leading to more people traveling domestically and internationally, and tourists visiting Korea centered on China and Southeast Asia are also increasing. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, last year's air passengers numbered 81.43 million, an 11% increase from the previous year (73.34 million). This is the highest performance in Korean aviation history. Airlines are also increasing or establishing new domestic and international routes, so jobs for aircraft cabin crew are expected to increase. However, since universities and professional hagwons continuously produce many personnel and existing employees' tenure is becoming longer than before, employment competition is expected to continue to be fierce. - Kang Ok-hee, Principal Researcher, Korea Employment Information Service Lifelong Career Development Center\\n\\nRepresentative Department - Inha Technical College Aviation Operations Department: Korea's First... 'School Life Like Real Practice'\\nInha Technical College (Inha Technical College) Aviation Operations Department has the longest history among aviation-related service departments at 2- and 4-year universities in Korea. Established in 1977 when overseas travel was prohibited, this year marks its 38th year. Lee Young-hee, Department Head of Inha Technical College Aviation Operations Department, said, 'At that time, Korean Air felt the need to provide better service to passengers and set a goal to properly train flight attendants by educating the necessary abilities for flight attendants from university.' This is why they evaluate qualifications as flight attendants as important from new student selection.\\n\\nThey select a total of 190 students annually, with early admission having a larger proportion than regular admission. They select 170 students, 90% of the total, through early admission rounds 1 and 2 combined, and select the remaining 10% through regular admission. Throughout early and regular admission, interviews have the biggest impact on acceptance or rejection. They usually evaluate five items: appearance, presentation skills, and situation response ability. Department Head Lee said, 'The interview proportion is about 67%,' and 'No matter how excellent your school records and CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores, it's difficult to pass if you don't receive good scores in the interview evaluation.' The annual admission competition ratio exceeds 50:1.\\n\\nThe school's biggest characteristic is employment-focused curriculum. The curriculum is focused on flight attendant training from one to ten. Representative examples include Aviation Cabin Service Practical Training, where students actually experience the role of flight attendants on airplanes, and Aviation In-flight Food and Beverage Practical Training classes. Students experience all the duties flight attendants must perform during flight on a Korean Air Boeing 777 aircraft prepared within the school. They learn restroom cleaning and safety equipment inspection before takeoff, food and beverage service after takeoff, and how to respond when emergency situations occur. Department Head Lee explained, 'Through these classes, students gain competitiveness not only for employment but also after joining airlines as flight attendants.' Kim Jin-hyeon, a second-year student in Inha Technical College Aviation Operations Department, said, 'Initially, I made many mistakes on the airplane and struggled to properly perform my assigned role,' and 'Through repeated practice, I built know-how for serving passengers and developed the ability to look after not just myself but also my surroundings.'\\n\\nTheory classes also help develop capabilities as flight attendants. They are broadly divided into foreign languages and service, and foreign languages don't simply involve acquiring basics and learning conversation, but help learn English, Chinese, and Japanese conversation used in aircraft cabins. The service field is the same. Through classes such as Service Mind, International Culture Understanding, and Communication Skills, students learn what attitude and tone to use when dealing with customers. Kim said, 'After graduation, it's possible to converse with passengers in three languages in the cabin, and everything from speech patterns to facial expressions changes.'\\n\\nPrograms supporting employment are also well-developed. Interview Practical Training classes teach English interviews and situation-specific response techniques for in-flight announcements, and English camps conducted during summer and winter vacations help achieve TOEIC scores necessary for airline employment. Department Head Lee said, 'Usually for 17 nights and 18 days, they concentrate only on English study from 9 AM to 6 PM at training centers designated by the school,' and 'Many people's TOEIC scores increase by 200 points after completing the camp.'\\n\\nIt's not just classes. Even in daily life, they ensure students maintain the attire and attitude of flight attendants. Students must wear semi-formal attire similar to flight attendant uniforms when coming to school, wear shoes with about 5cm heels, and tie their hair up high in a single bundle. Also, if students don't smile when responding when professors call their names during class, they receive deductions in attitude scores, implementing 'making smiles a way of life.' Department Head Lee said, 'We're raising flight attendants with capabilities from head to toe and even to the bone,' and 'Thanks to these efforts, 117 out of 190 graduates in academic year 2015 were employed by airlines, showing good results.'\\n\\n- Reporter Jeon Min-hee jeon.minhee@joongang.co.kr\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9618, "output_tokens": 4203, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It's when students finishing hagwon classes flow out like a receding tide. The roads are in chaos with vehicles that have flocked to transport them. Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], where about 1,000 hagwons and tutoring centers are gathered, is 'hagwon education hub No. 1.' Daechi (大峙) means a big hill that's hard to cross. The name originates from a large stone mountain that was once here, but today Daechi is read with a different meaning. It has become a gateway that must be crossed to enter 'SKY' - Seoul National University, Yonsei University, and Korea University - and other top-tier universities, and a major hill in the early part of life. The formation of the hagwon district here began in the early 1990s. What's the reason Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] has been regarded as the 'solution to college entrance exams' for over 20 years since then? The photo shows the scene in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] around 10 PM on the 18th.\\n\\nPublic Education Built 80% of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]\\n\\nDaechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], called 'hagwon education hub No. 1,' receives both admiring and critical gazes. In our society where academic elitism is rampant, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] is a space of hope that widens the gateway to prestigious universities. There are opposing views too. It has been pointed out as the breeding ground of 'tiger moms' who change their children's grades with hagwon education costs that ordinary people cannot afford, and as the main culprit ruining public education. The education policies the government has put forward in recent years have focused on 'suppressing Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon education' in this context. Recently, as admission methods for specialized high schools and universities have changed, the Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district is in a hesitant mood. Are admission policies aimed at curbing hagwon education really effective? Then how can we explain Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] new hagwons that attract parental attention by transforming into various forms such as 'integrated tutoring and lecture-type hagwons' or 'science and essay hagwons for gifted children'? How did the trust arise that 'no matter how education policy changes, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] comes up with optimal alternatives within a week' and 'even if we can't trust schools, we trust Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]'? We organized the past history of Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district and examined what message this place throws to our education.\\n\\n1970s-80s: Formation of 'Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] School District 8' with Relocation of Prestigious High Schools\\n\\nThe foundation that allowed Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district to form goes back to the formation of 'Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] School District 8.' Prestigious schools such as Kyunggi High School, Seoul High School, Whimoon High School, Sehwa Girls' High School, Jinsun Girls' High School, and Sookmyung Girls' High School settled in the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho-gu area, more specifically near Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry].\\n\\nSchool District 8 schools enjoyed their golden age from when the high school equalization policy was implemented in the 1980s until specialized high schools like foreign language high schools and science high schools became popular around 1992. Mr. Han, who calls himself 'Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] School District 8, first generation,' said, \\\"When I graduated from S High School in 84, 80 students from our school alone entered Seoul National University, and 100 each entered Yonsei and Korea University,\\\" adding \\\"Out of 60 students in our class, 9 entered Seoul National University alone, and 20 were accepted to Yonsei, Korea University, and Sogang University, so 'Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] School District 8' was featured as top news stories day after day.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, until this time, the center of hagwon education was not Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]. Kim Young-gyu, director of Youngjae Math Hagwon, says \\\"Songpa's Ssial Hakdang and Janghak Hagwon, and Apgujeong's Soorim Hagwon were popular.\\\"\\n\\nDaechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district formed when 'sharp-eyed' hagwons began moving there one by one. Director Kim said, \\\"Looking at the school district density, it seemed Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] would become education hub No. 1,\\\" explaining \\\"Renowned prestigious high schools were gathered together, and the surrounding apartments were full of parents with high educational enthusiasm who moved in aiming for Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] School District 8 admission, so optimal conditions for setting up hagwons were in place.\\\"\\n\\n1990s: Fast Response to Specialized High School Admissions, Beginning of Golden Age\\nAs Autonomous Private High Schools and International Middle Schools with Difficult Written Exams Increase, Demand Explodes\\nGathering Students from Provinces with CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]-Centered University Admissions, National Influence\\n\\n1990s Education Diversification Policy... Foreign Language High School and Autonomous Private High School Admission Classes Popular\\n\\nDaechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district reached its golden age when foreign language high schools began increasing one by one starting with Daewon Foreign Language High School and Daeil Foreign Language High School in 84, and these schools received authorization as 'specialized high schools' in 92. At the time of establishment, foreign language high schools were not specialized high schools like today but were classified as 'miscellaneous schools' and had the character of alternative schools. Mr. Choi, a first-generation student of Daewon Foreign Language High School, said \\\"Foreign language high schools weren't places where top-tier students aiming for good universities came, but schools where friends who simply liked foreign languages gathered,\\\" adding \\\"During Korean or science classes, there were many students who took notes in English of what the teacher explained in Korean.\\\"\\n\\nForeign language high schools gained word-of-mouth reputation when their 'Spartan' teaching methods became known. Mr. Choi said, \\\"Since they selected students based only on English written exams, there were large grade gaps among admitted students,\\\" adding \\\"The school made us do supplementary classes and self-study until 11 PM every day.\\\" As this became known, parents and students who were looking for elite schools for liberal arts students to attend after high school equalization began flocking to foreign language high schools. When they received specialized high school authorization in 92, foreign language high school competition rates soared even higher.\\n\\nDaechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district, which quickly read the demand from parents with top-tier children, had foreign language high school admission classes prepared early on. Fermat Hagwon for math and Easy Language Hagwon, Jungsang Language Hagwon, and Choesun Language Hagwon for English achieved great success and fired the starting gun for Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] success myth. Kim Hyun-jung, CEO of Dschool, said \\\"At that time, the formula 'specialized high school admission = Fermat Hagwon' was openly circulated.\\\" She said \\\"Fermat's first class started at 4 AM, and the last class ended at 2 AM the next day,\\\" adding \\\"The atmosphere was such that children taking 4 AM classes would say 'starting study early in the morning activates the brain, so it's good.'\\\"\\n\\nAfter 2000, nine more foreign language high schools were established in the Gyeonggi and Incheon regions. Competition between Gyeonggi-Incheon region and Seoul region foreign language high schools also began in earnest. Each school raised the level of written exams to attract top-tier middle school students. Accordingly, specialized high school admission hagwon districts became even more crowded. In addition, when autonomous private high schools such as Minjok Leadership Academy, POSCO Academy, and Gwangyang POSCO Academy were established in 2002, Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district was shaken once again. Some Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] parents' target schools changed from 'Daewon Foreign Language High School' to 'Minjok Leadership Academy.' As schools promoting elite education such as specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools increased, the number of people flocking to specialized high school preparation hagwon districts exploded.\\n\\n2006: Cheongshim Middle School Opens... Elementary School Student College Entrance Exam Education Fever\\n\\nWhen Cheongshim International Middle School opened in 2006 and Daewon International Middle School and Younghoon International Middle School opened one after another in 2009, the age at which hagwon education begins was also significantly lowered. At the time of opening, Daewon International Middle School set iBT 90 points, IET (International English Scholastic Competition) grade 4 or higher, 20 English original books, Korean language certification test scores, and Chinese character certification test scores as first-round document screening requirements. The admission competition rate for Daewon International Middle School's first class was 20.6:1, and Younghoon International Middle School was 10.6:1. Lee Mi-ae, CEO of Sharon Coaching & Mentoring Research Institute, said \\\"It was a time when the sight of elementary school lower-grade students preparing for international middle schools dragging large travel bags from hagwon to hagwon seemed like a symbol of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry].\\\"\\n\\nUniversity admission hagwons also heated up during the same period. Lee Chae-yeon, CEO of Myungin Hagwon, said \\\"The admission policy where you could go to a good university regardless of school records [GPA] if you just did well on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] expanded Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district infinitely.\\\" She explained, \\\"Since the final gateway of college entrance exams converged on one test called CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], parents with high school children had no choice but to flock to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] looking for star instructors for each CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subject.\\\" 'Math Han Seok-won, Korean Lee Hyo-sang, Social Studies Sohn Ju-eun, Science Lee Beom' were circulated like catchphrases, and high school students from across the nation flocked to their lectures like clouds. During vacations, provincial students resided in officetels and goshiwons in the Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] area and took special lectures by 'top instructors (most popular instructors).'\\n\\nDirector Kim said \\\"The effect was also significant where many top-tier middle school students gathered at specialized high school hagwons flowed directly into Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] university admission hagwons,\\\" explaining \\\"Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] parents, who had strong educational enthusiasm and economic power, were willing to pay the high lecture fees of expensive top instructors, and top-class instructors also had no choice but to gather in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry].\\\" Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district, covering international middle school-specialized high school-university admissions, wrote its myth while bustling day and night.\\n\\nHagwons Close Due to Hagwon Education Suppression, But Parent Burden Remains the Same\\nExperts: \\\"Weak Public Education Cannot Bring Down Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] Stronghold\\\"\\nMust First Raise School Education Level to Dismantle Hagwon Education Hub No. 1\\n\\nHagwon Education Suppression Policy... 2008 Specialized High School Selection by School Records [GPA]\\n\\nHowever, Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district's steep growth curve became sharply gentler between 2008-2011. The turning point was when specialized high school selection methods changed from school-specific written exams to middle school English school records [GPA] in 2008. Entering the 2010s, the 'easy CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]' tone was maintained and the government's admission diversification policy increased university early admission programs. As CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]'s influence became less than before, Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] heat subsided. International middle school admissions, which had driven even kindergarteners and elementary students into the hagwon education market, also changed to a lottery system in 2014.\\n\\nLee Jong-seo, director of Etoos Chungsol Evaluation Research Institute, explained \\\"As CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] became easier, there was no need to specifically seek out Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] top instructors, and as EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] connection rates rose to 70%, 'solo test-takers' who studied independently while listening to internet lectures increased.\\\" Education critic Lee Beom said \\\"As specialized high schools' school-specific written exams disappeared, foreign language high school admission hagwons took a direct hit,\\\" adding \\\"Large franchise hagwons closed one after another.\\\"\\n\\nThe measure prohibiting hagwon classes after 10 PM, implemented from 2010, also dealt a blow to Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district. Kim Young-gyu, director of Youngjae Hagwon, expressed that \\\"the 'hagwon teaching time restriction measure' tightened the last breath of Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district.\\\" Unlike before when one instructor could lecture four times a day at 4 PM, 7 PM, 10 PM, and 12 AM, being able to lecture only 1-2 times a day worsened hagwon profitability. Director Kim said \\\"With school after-school programs making students' dismissal times later and hagwon teaching restricted to 10 PM, it became impossible to create hagwon schedules,\\\" adding \\\"The time students stayed at hagwons itself became shorter, so we had to reduce the number of classes and instructors, and ultimately the hagwon scale had no choice but to shrink.\\\"\\n\\nLarge Hagwon Instructors Who Lost Jobs Move to Small Hagwons\\n\\nAs large hagwons' profitability worsened, hagwons put up for sale have recently increased significantly. Mr. Shin, a Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] real estate agent, said \\\"On the surface it seems like they continue classes normally, but there are countless hagwons secretly put up at low prices, yet there aren't really people who want to buy them.\\\" Kim Gab-soo, chairman of the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Private Academy Federation, said \\\"Much more hagwons than shown in statistics are disappearing,\\\" adding \\\"It's true that Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district is in a recession.\\\" Chairman Kim said \\\"As large hagwons over 100 pyeong [approximately 3,300 square feet] fall into management difficulties and downsize, instructors who lost jobs in this process are opening small hagwons nearby,\\\" explaining \\\"Large hagwons are splitting and splitting again, so just looking at numbers it seems like the number of hagwons is maintained, but individual hagwons' management conditions are becoming increasingly poor.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee, who runs a supplementary hagwon, said \\\"Real estate agents constantly call asking me to take over hagwons,\\\" adding \\\"I receive calls like 'It's 50 million won [approximately $38,000 USD] deposit and 3.5 million won [approximately $2,650 USD] monthly rent, with 50 students and 2 instructors. We'll hand everything over, so just take the 50 million won [approximately $38,000 USD] deposit,' which would have been unimaginable 5 years ago (when Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] situation was good).\\\"\\n\\nEducation critic Lee Beom analyzed, \\\"Changes in admission policies continuing since 2008 succeeded in segmenting the traditional hagwon education market of 'international middle school-specialized high school-university admission CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam],'\\\" adding \\\"Although there's talk that the early admission market grew as much as the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] market shrank, it's not enough to offset the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] market's reduction, so the part of curbing hagwon education through education policy can be seen as somewhat successful.\\\"\\n\\nStill Inadequate Public Education: \\\"Hagwon Education Won't Disappear\\\"\\n\\nSince this hagwon district has stagnated, is the stronghold of hagwon education hub No. 1 also crumbling? Education experts unanimously said \\\"Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district will find an optimized system again\\\" and \\\"The total scale of hagwon education costs consumed here won't decrease.\\\"\\n\\nThe reason they're optimistic about Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district is simple. Korea's public education is too weak to bring down Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] stronghold. Lee Jong-seo, director of Etoos Chungsol Evaluation Research Institute, said \\\"The first condition for hagwon education growth is precisely public education's inadequacy,\\\" adding \\\"Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], hagwon education hub No. 1's vitality is inversely proportional to public education's soundness.\\\"\\n\\nEducation critic Lee Beom also pointed out, \\\"Korea's public education inefficiency and irresponsibility are the foundation that erected Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district.\\\" He criticized public education's problems with specific examples. \\\"Looking at Korea's high school curriculum, it's structured on the premise that classes occur until the day right before graduation,\\\" pointing out \\\"In reality, since students must take CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] in November of senior year, they must finish all coursework by senior year first semester at the latest and enter college entrance exam preparation.\\\" He also said \\\"The most ideal curriculum would be finishing all coursework by sophomore year and entering the admission system for early admission and regular admission in senior year.\\\" Since the curriculum is unrealistic, the only way for students to survive is advanced learning through hagwon education.\\n\\nCounter-arguments to criticisms that Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon education increasingly targets younger students and uses fear marketing were also found in public education. Instructor Choi at P Hagwon, a reading discussion hagwon for kindergarten and elementary students, said \\\"Parents who come here don't trust school education at all,\\\" adding \\\"Since elementary school first grade doesn't properly teach even reading and writing Korean, parents naturally have no choice but to seek help from hagwon education.\\\" In fact, Korea's elementary school first grade has only 4 weeks allocated for the 'reading' process.\\n\\nDissatisfaction with English education is also great. Parent Cho Eun-jung (Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Seoul, 40) with elementary school children said \\\"School English is just 2 hours a week from elementary 3rd grade and 3 hours from 5th grade,\\\" adding \\\"I don't think you can master a foreign language with this level of classes.\\\" Ms. Cho said \\\"They say they'll make CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] English an absolute evaluation qualification test to curb English hagwon education, but English isn't aimed at CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] but a basic ability children living in future society should have,\\\" raising her voice, \\\"It's a natural result to send children to good hagwons because what schools teach is insufficient.\\\" Another parent, Kim So-yeon (Seocho-gu, Seoul, 38), pointed out, \\\"When consulting with school teachers about children's academics, I often hear advice to 'send them to hagwons,'\\\" adding \\\"The problem is that even public education teachers don't think they can improve children's academic abilities through school education.\\\"\\n\\nKim Jung-baek, sociology professor at Kyung Hee University, said \\\"Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district received attention because it quenched the thirst that public education couldn't fill,\\\" adding \\\"If admission policy focus is placed on 'improving public education level' rather than 'hagwon education suppression,' Daechi-dong's [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon district will naturally walk the path of dismantlement.\\\"\\n\\nBy Park Hyung-soo, Jeon Min-hee, Jung Hyun-jin hspark97@joongang.co.kr Photo by Kim Kyung-rok kimkr8486@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8893, "output_tokens": 5998, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This means establishing long-term plans and making sustained efforts. The same applies not just to students but to parents as well. In an era where students must study for CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] and school records while parents must study college admission systems. College entrance briefings help make the complex and difficult admission system and over 2,000 different admission tracks easier to understand. Even knowing these briefings are hagwon [private academy] marketing, parents flock to briefing venues. They want to establish even slightly advantageous strategies for their children. According to parents who frequently attend briefings, there are four stages to becoming an expert: confusion-addiction-stagnation-maturity. Below are photos and graphics depicting the four stages of parents' initiation into college entrance briefings, parodying 'Maslow's hierarchy of needs.' Do you frequently attend briefings? If so, which stage do you fall into? Who are these college entrance briefings, which have reached fever pitch beyond mere enthusiasm, really for?\\n\\nFirst Confusion, Then Addiction... \\\"I go three times a day\\\"\\n\\nAt 11 AM on the 6th at the Textile Center in Samseong-dong, Seoul, about 500 parents flocked to a 'Final Strategy Briefing for 2016 Early Decision vs Regular Decision' prepared by a hagwon education company. Forty percent of attendees were men. One mother who came with her husband said, \\\"Husband and wife must join forces for our child's college admission,\\\" adding \\\"We came an hour early worried there might be no seats.\\\" Another parent said, \\\"I've attended education briefings at least once a week since my current high school senior was in third grade,\\\" adding \\\"Combined, it would exceed 300 times.\\\" The term 'college entrance briefing fever' is not an exaggeration. Beyond raising children healthily, it has become reality that parents must become education experts.\\n\\n'Essential, Not Optional' Briefings\\n\\nMs. Kim (50, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], Seoul), who has children in 12th grade, 7th grade, and 6th grade, is frantically chasing education briefings these days. Since the educational information needed varies by grade level, there are many briefings she must attend. Sometimes she participates three or more times per day. A few days ago, she attended an 'Admission Counseling Specialist Training Course' run by a hagwon education company from 10 AM to 1 PM, then listened to a 'Strategy Briefing for 2016 Essay Writing Exam Preparation' at a small hagwon in Daechi-dong from 2 PM to 4 PM. After that, she exchanged educational information with close mothers at a cafe for about an hour, then participated in 'Preparing for Special Purpose/Autonomous Private High Schools from 7th Grade' organized by a math hagwon from 7:30 PM. Ms. Kim said, \\\"Starting in September when entrance exams approach, there are many briefings I must attend,\\\" adding \\\"I have less free time than when I worked.\\\"\\n\\nA considerable number of parents with high educational fervor are enthusiastic about attending briefings. Just those related to college entrance exams include college application strategies, university-specific admission briefings, high school entrance briefings, international middle school admissions, hagwon briefings, and countless others. Adding briefings related to general child education such as adolescent child management, career planning lectures, and reading guidance methods increases the number much further.\\n\\nCollege entrance briefings now seem to have become essential rather than optional. This is due to the complex college admission system and frequently changing education policies. In the 1980s during the academic achievement test era, studying well was enough to get into a good university, but now it's different. One must understand over 2,000 college admission tracks and establish strategies. Instead of busy test-takers, strategizing has become parents' responsibility. One parent met at a briefing venue said, \\\"These days, mothers must be managers scheduling children's hagwon schedules, drivers shuttling between hagwons and schools, and even education experts,\\\" adding \\\"Every time I come to briefings, I desperately want to emigrate.\\\"\\n\\nParents find this reality frustrating but think they have no choice but to follow along. They fear falling behind if they don't participate in briefings. Ms. Jung (53, Mokdong, Seoul), who sent both children to university, said, \\\"I didn't feel the need to attend briefings for my first child but regretted it when writing early decision applications,\\\" adding \\\"Later when preparing my second child's college admission, I attended every briefing I could as time permitted.\\\" Ms. Shin Jeong-yeon (49, Daechi-dong, Seoul), who has children in first year of university and 12th grade, feels the same. Ms. Shin said, \\\"Among people around me who got into universities better than their ability level, there's no one who didn't diligently attend briefings,\\\" adding \\\"Even if you get separate consulting for details, drawing the big picture for college admission has become the mother's role.\\\"\\n\\nFlood of Briefings Since 2009 Introduction of Admissions Officer System\\n\\nBriefings became as numerous as now starting from when the admissions officer system expanded in 2009. As entrance exam tracks diversified, information parents needed to know increased, and various organizations including the Korean Council for University Education (KCUE), large hagwon education companies, small tutoring hagwons, high schools, local governments, and financial sectors began holding college entrance briefings. In 2011 alone, college entrance briefings hosted by KCUE exceeded 31 times. While the frequency varies yearly, total attendance increased about four-fold from 47,193 people in 2012 to 197,476 people in 2014. College entrance briefings held by Jongro Academy Sky Education, a hagwon education company, show the same trend. In 2010, 10,748 people participated in 5 sessions, but this year 32,797 people already attended just the 4 briefings held in the first half.\\n\\nThe age range of parents visiting college entrance briefing venues is also lowering. Among 6,188 applicants for the 'Sky Education Special Purpose/Autonomous Private High School Selection and University Admission Intensive Analysis' briefing held by Jongro Academy Sky Education last May, 2,078 people (33.6%) were parents of pre-school and elementary children. This means mothers are starting to prepare for entrance exams from earlier.\\n\\nCollege entrance briefings began taking their current form starting from when CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] was implemented in 1994. Lee Young-deok, director of Daesung Academic Development Research Institute, said, \\\"When CSAT was implemented, many people were curious about the changed entrance exam system,\\\" adding \\\"Even then, over 5,000 people flocked there.\\\" The special purpose high school fever that blew from the mid-1990s expanded college entrance briefings from college to high school admissions. Lim Seong-ho, president of Jongro Academy Sky Education, said, \\\"Over 1,000 parents from across the nation flocked to the special purpose high school briefing in 1999,\\\" adding \\\"Some people even flew in from Jeju Island.\\\" From around 2000, large hagwon education companies like Cheongsol Academy, Daesung Academy, and Megastudy began holding briefings for 10,000 people per session.\\n\\nThe format of briefings is also diversifying to meet consumer demands. KCUE has been holding University Admission Information Fairs since 2011, allowing parents to directly meet and consult with university admission officials. Kim Young-sim, director of KCUE's College Admission Counseling Center, explained, \\\"Recently, there's more interest in customized briefings rather than one-way briefings.\\\" Choi Eun-ji, team leader at Etoos Cheongsol Education Evaluation Research Institute, said, \\\"This year's 'Mock Test Briefings' and 'Early Decision Application Strategy Briefings' were held by academic track targeting the highest achievers,\\\" adding \\\"Briefings are also changing while accommodating parents' demands.\\\"\\n\\nFinding Suitable Lectures Is Not Easy\\n\\nThere are stages to becoming absorbed in briefings. Parents divide this process into four stages: confusion period, addiction period, stagnation period, and maturity period. The first stage is the confusion period. Ms. Lee Eun-jeong (51, Mokdong, Yangcheon-gu), who finished her child's entrance exams last year, said, \\\"Starting as early as when children are in elementary school, most experience 'mental breakdown' when they begin attending college entrance briefings.\\\" This is because they can't understand even half of what the lecturer says. Parents who realize their shortcomings judge that not attending briefings frequently enough was the problem and enter the second stage addiction period.\\n\\nDuring the addiction period, they must participate in all briefings held everywhere - large hagwon education companies, small hagwons, district offices, schools - to feel satisfied. If they miss even one, they show symptoms of anxiety and restlessness. Ms. Kim Su-hyeon (47, Garak-dong, Seoul), who has a son in 8th grade, said, \\\"When I missed important briefings due to housework or personal matters, anxiety would unknowingly overwhelm me,\\\" adding \\\"Even when parents who attended briefings told me 'it was nothing special,' I couldn't feel relieved.\\\" When Ms. Kim confided this state to a senior parent, she was told \\\"You seem addicted to briefings like shopping addiction.\\\"\\n\\nThe third stage, stagnation period, is when they distance themselves from briefings, thinking 'Do I really need to go this far for my child's education?' This comes earlier the less outstanding the child's grades are. This is because they realize that no matter how frantically mothers attend briefings, it's of little use if the child's ability doesn't keep up. There's also the aspect of worrying about relationships with children deteriorating. Ms. Shin said, \\\"On days I returned from college entrance briefings, I couldn't stand seeing my child watching TV,\\\" adding \\\"I ended up nagging more about 'study,' so I deliberately didn't attend briefings for a while.\\\"\\n\\nThe maturity period is the stage where through various trials and errors, they learn to use briefings appropriately and seek out only what's essential for them. Ms. Jun (46, Mokdong, Seoul), who has children in 12th grade and 6th grade, said, \\\"After attending for about 2-3 years, you not only know what you lack, but also roughly identify which entrance exam experts properly explain difficult content in ways parents can understand,\\\" adding \\\"Unlike before when I participated indiscriminately, now when hagwons send briefing notification texts, I look at the lecturer and make selective choices.\\\" It becomes possible to receive less stress and obtain educational information helpful to oneself.\\n\\nMother's Information Power Doesn't Correlate with Child's Ability\\n\\nThe biggest reason mothers visit briefing venues is to obtain entrance exam information, but it's not simply because of educational information alone. Many say there's a kind of healing effect where just going to briefings makes them feel better. Ms. Lee said, \\\"The anxious and restless feelings about my child's entrance exams subside when I'm listening to briefings,\\\" adding \\\"Thinking that I'm doing my best effort provides self-comfort.\\\"\\n\\nIt also serves as a stimulant. When they clash with their children while preparing for entrance exams and get stressed and exhausted, going to briefing venues and seeing other mothers helps them pull themselves together. Ms. Song (40, Bundang, Gyeonggi), who has children in 6th grade and 1st grade, said, \\\"There are quite a few mothers who say 'I need to go to a briefing to get some stimulation,'\\\" adding \\\"It seems many participate to use it as an opportunity for self-reflection rather than understanding information.\\\"\\n\\nIt's also an expression of support for their children. It's an unspoken message saying 'I'm making this much effort for you.' Ms. Kim said, \\\"Children are consciously and unconsciously influenced by their parents' actions,\\\" adding \\\"Even if diligently attending college entrance briefings doesn't raise children's grades, I think it will have a positive influence.\\\"\\n\\nBriefings have now established themselves as a community culture among parents. Listening to briefings together and gathering at nearby cafes to exchange information about college admission tracks or child education is a familiar scene. Ms. Lee said, \\\"Mainly mothers with similar grades attend briefings together and share educational information,\\\" adding \\\"It becomes an opportunity to gauge children's levels and view entrance exams from a broader perspective.\\\"\\n\\nBut mothers need to know something. A mother's information power doesn't develop her child's ability. There's no use if only the mother 'studies hard.' Teacher Ahn Gwang-bok from Jungdong High School said, \\\"During counseling, I often see cases where the mother knows SKY [Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University] entrance exam tracks by heart, but the child can't even get into Seoul metropolitan area universities,\\\" adding \\\"There's a need to match the child's eye level.\\\" This means most parents try to find answers at college entrance briefings, but ultimately the answer lies with their children. Teacher Ahn added, \\\"While participating in college entrance briefings has become unavoidable reality for parents who want to send their children to good universities, what's more important is paying attention to their children.\\\"\\n\\n▶ How to Use College Entrance Briefings According to Senior Parents\\n\\n① Abandon Impatience and Greed\\nThe biggest misconception mothers who attend briefings have is the absurd belief that 'attending briefings will solve everything.' Ideals and reality are different. If you try to learn everything from A to Z at once, you'll easily get exhausted. You need to think that learning just one piece of information at a time is beneficial.\\nYou must let go of impatient feelings. This is why participation in college entrance briefings is recommended from 10th grade. If you pour large amounts of information all at once in 12th grade, a year passes while being confused. Also, with increased early decision recruitment, the three-year high school process greatly influences entrance exams. Shin Dong-won, vice principal of Whimoon High School, said, \\\"There's a need to grasp the overall context and trends while drawing the big picture by listening to college entrance briefings in 10th grade.\\\" You also need to understand basic information about briefing seasons. Knowing generally what field briefings occur in which months means you won't be anxious if you miss one or two. Usually briefings are held on: winter vacation hagwon special lectures and CSAT regular decision (November-December), science gifted schools (February-May), science high schools (May-July), summer vacation special lectures (June-July), CSAT early decision (July-September), special purpose/autonomous private high schools (June-November).\\n\\n② Believe Only Half of What Hagwons Say\\nParents believe briefings will serve as navigation for selecting hagwons perfectly suited to their children, but most fall into confusion. This is because even for the same subject, each hagwon emphasizes different content. For English, debate hagwons emphasize English debate, Korean-style English hagwons emphasize grammar, and reading discussion hagwons emphasize reading original texts. Ms. Shin Jeong-yeon (49, Daechi-dong, Seoul), who has children in first year of university and 12th grade, said, \\\"Mothers need to maintain their center well,\\\" adding \\\"You can believe only half of what hagwons say.\\\" If you don't keep your wits about you, you can easily fall for hagwon marketing tactics. Ms. Lee, who has a child in 7th grade, said, \\\"When I first went to a briefing, I was tempted by the hagwon director's words and double-registered for various hagwons, then had trouble canceling,\\\" adding \\\"Since then, I read posts about hagwons on education communities or investigate surrounding opinions, then attend at least three hagwon briefings to carefully examine commonalities and differences.\\\"\\n\\n③ Definitely Attend Your Desired High School's Briefing\\nParents of middle school children are immediately concerned about high school admissions. Ms. Shin, who has a child in 11th grade, said, \\\"If you're interested in special purpose/autonomous private high schools, you should listen to school-hosted briefings at least once.\\\" They reveal high-level information unavailable at hagwon college entrance briefings, such as news that 'students without straight A's from last year's entrance exam results were automatically eliminated.'\\nHowever, places with high student and parent preference are difficult to even participate in. Hana High School, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Affiliated High School, Sangsan High School, and Hanil High School are representative examples. Ms. Kim Su-hyeon (47, Garak-dong, Seoul), who has a son in 8th grade, experienced 'instant elimination' while trying to make reservations for Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Affiliated High School's briefing. She was waiting from 9:50 AM for 10 AM reservations, but registration ended in 20 seconds. Ms. Kim said, \\\"It's harder than idol concert tickets or Chuseok holiday train reservations,\\\" adding \\\"Next year I'll have to go to a PC room or mobilize relatives.\\\"\\nThere's a reason special purpose/autonomous private high school briefings are popular. Most have school tour programs. Touring the school the child aims for and talking with current students provides good motivation. Consequently, servers often crash due to access overload on briefing reservation days. However, even if you can't make reservations, most schools let you stand and listen at the back of the auditorium.\\n\\n④ Stay Until the End at University-Specific Briefings\\nCollege entrance briefings should be approached in order: high school, large hagwon education companies, then university-hosted briefings. After understanding school levels through your current high school's briefings, you should participate in briefings by Daesung Academy, Jongro Academy Sky Education, etc. to understand the overall flow of university admissions. Then establish specific strategies through briefings held by university admissions offices.\\nEspecially at university-specific briefings, you must stay until the end. Choice information emerges when mothers gather in small groups to have Q&A sessions with admissions officers. Ms. Kim Hyeon-jeong (48, Daechi-dong, Seoul), who has children in first year of university and 12th grade, said, \\\"Some mothers bring their children's school records when going to university admission briefings and receive on-the-spot consulting from admissions officers,\\\" adding \\\"Reactions vary tremendously depending on university atmosphere and admission officials' tendencies, but it's worth trying.\\\"\\nSharing entrance exam information with children is also necessary. This is the case for Ms. Jun (46, Mokdong, Seoul), who has a child in 12th grade. Ms. Jun searches for videos and shows only parts that would help her child. Ms. Jun said, \\\"Through this, students realize what they need more,\\\" adding \\\"There's no use if only parents frantically attend briefings.\\\"\\n\\nBy reporters Jun Min-hee, Jung Hyeon-jin, Jo Han-dae jeon.minhee@joongang.co.kr\\nPhoto by reporter Kim Gyeong-rok kimkr8486@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9844, "output_tokens": 4737, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

We analyzed Statistics Korea's resident migration data and population trends from the past 10 years. In the first installment, we examined where the population that migrated from Gangnam District went the most. Just as education was the biggest factor that created today's Gangnam, there is analysis that education is also an important reason for leaving Gangnam. Metropolitan new city development and successive apartment reconstruction are also major factors in population changes. We examined these changes focusing on Pangyo, which is emerging as the second Gangnam.\\n\\n\\\"Don't like the intense educational environment\\\" Nearly half of Pangyo migrants are parents in their 30s and 40s\\n\\n\\\"Like innovative schools and country living for elementary education\\\" \\\"Don't know if we'll return to Gangnam when they become middle and high schoolers\\\" CEOs also migrate, creating premium image\\n\\n'Second Gangnam' 'Golden commercial district of southern Gyeonggi' 'High income level and high purchasing potential'... These are the phrases used to describe Pangyo New City, where Hyundai Department Store Pangyo branch, which recently opened as the largest scale in the metropolitan area, is located. Indeed, this place is similar to Gangnam in many ways. High housing prices, good school districts, well-equipped convenience facilities, and so on. In the 70s and 80s, prestigious high schools like Gyeonggi High School, Whimoon High School, and Sookmyung Girls' High School established themselves in Gangnam, drawing parents with high educational fervor to Gangnam, and housing prices in that area rose significantly. Pangyo also gained attention from high-income professional parents in their 30s and 40s, starting with the opening of Bopyeong Elementary School, an innovative school, in 2009, along with the new city premium. That year, a total of 5 elementary schools including Naksaeng Elementary and Unjung Elementary, and 4 middle schools including Sampyeong Middle and Bopyeong Middle opened in Pangyo, and the number has increased further since then. Pangyo housing prices are soaring high. 30-pyeong [approximately 990 square feet] apartments are priced at 800-900 million won [approximately $600,000-680,000 USD]. Convenience facilities like department stores and shopping malls are also being built one after another.\\n\\nWhen Gangnam Tong-Shin analyzed Statistics Korea's resident migration data and Gangnam District's population trends to examine Gangnam's population movement, it was found that a considerable number of Gangnam residents actually migrated to this area. Excluding Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa districts, the place where the most population flowed out from Gangnam District was Seongnam City, where Pangyo New City is located. Particularly in 2009, when large-scale apartments were built in Pangyo New City, the population moving from Gangnam to Seongnam City recorded 7,402 people, an increase of nearly 3,000 people compared to previous years. Since Pangyo New City was the only area in Seongnam City where apartment move-ins began that year, most of these people went to Pangyo. In 2010 and 2011, about 6,000 people each moved from Gangnam District to Seongnam City. Looking at their age groups, about 40% of the total were in their 30s and 40s. Han Mi-ok, representative of Pangyo Samsung Licensed Real Estate Agency, said, \\\"Among Pangyo New City residents, excluding those who came from nearby Gyeonggi areas like Suwon, Yongin, and Bundang, those from Gangnam are the most numerous,\\\" adding \\\"Many of them are parents in their 30s and 40s with elementary school children.\\\"\\n\\nSchool in Pangyo, hagwons in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]\\n\\nMs. Lee (39), who lives in Pangyo, moved from Gaepo-dong to Pangyo in 2009 when her daughter entered elementary school. Her husband works as a professional in Gangnam.\\n\\n\\\"When my child was in kindergarten, I saw surrounding parents making their children study severely. I thought my daughter, who has a weak constitution, wouldn't be able to endure in that environment. So we rented out our Gaepo-dong house and moved into a Seo-Pangyo apartment on lease. When the child becomes a middle and high schooler, we might go back. But I hear it's hard to get good school records [GPA] there, so I'm not really inclined to do so.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Lee's daughter, who became a 6th grader this year, attends school in Pangyo but only goes to hagwons in Daechi-dong. It takes 20 minutes by car to travel from Pangyo to Daechi-dong. She hopes for admission to autonomous private high schools or special-purpose high schools like Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Attached High School or Gyeonggi Foreign Language High School. Ms. Lee said, \\\"Since a hagwon district hasn't formed in Pangyo yet, many students go to Jeongja-dong in Bundang or to Daechi-dong.\\\"\\n\\nAmong those who came from Gangnam to Pangyo, there are many elementary school parents like Ms. Lee. Lim Seong-ho, representative of Jongro Hagwon Sky Education, said, \\\"Among Pangyo moms, there are many who think they don't want to make their children focus only on studying from elementary school,\\\" adding \\\"Since Gangnam doesn't have an atmosphere where you can let children play, there are cases where they choose Pangyo to avoid that atmosphere.\\\"\\n\\nBopyeong Elementary School, an innovative school, is often chosen by those who lived abroad for their children's education. Seo Gil-won, current director of the School Policy Division at Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education, who was the principal when the school opened in 2009, said, \\\"A considerable number of students who entered Bopyeong Elementary that year were children of major corporation overseas stationed employees,\\\" adding \\\"Many parents were attracted to the fact that Bopyeong Elementary's curriculum was similar to foreign schools and emphasized experiential learning and arts and physical education.\\\"\\n\\nJeong Guk-hee, representative of Dongbang Licensed Real Estate Office, said, \\\"Even today, someone called asking about leases in Pangyo, saying they're returning from abroad in January next year, and asked about the atmosphere of nearby elementary and middle school students,\\\" adding \\\"They said they were considering Daechi-dong but didn't like the bleak atmosphere and wanted to come to Pangyo because there are many new apartments.\\\"\\n\\nSome view 2012 as the period when the most Gangnam people came to Pangyo. It was the year reconstruction of Daechi Cheongshil Apartment (now Daechi Palace) began. Han Mi-ok, representative of Samsung Licensed Real Estate Office, said, \\\"In the early move-in period of Pangyo New City in 2009, many came from Gyeonggi areas like Suwon, Yongin, Bundang, and Ilsan, but in 2012, people migrating from Daechi-dong increased significantly,\\\" adding \\\"About 20% of one complex of Pangyo Prugio Grandeur apartments were people from Daechi-dong.\\\"\\n\\nForming new wealthy town with Chung Yong-jin, Shinsegae chairman, and others\\n\\nThe satisfaction level of those who came from Gangnam to Pangyo is generally high. Mr. Kim, a foreign company executive in his 40s who moved from Samseong-dong to Pangyo, cited the sense of stability gained from intimate relationships with neighbors as a joy of living in Pangyo. \\\"When living in Gangnam, neighbors wouldn't greet each other even when they met, but here people greet each other even if they're strangers,\\\" he said, adding \\\"I think it's because the residential environment is pleasant and there's peace of mind, and I think it's also education for the child to learn the leisure of getting along with surroundings without worrying about grades or pressure.\\\"\\n\\nBeing able to live a country life is also an advantage of Pangyo. A teacher in his 40s moved from Daechi-dong to Pangyo-dong two years ago, built a country house, and lives with his elementary school child. It's a characteristic of this area that many people live in townhouses or houses with three or more children. He said, \\\"I plan to live in Pangyo until the child attends middle school,\\\" adding \\\"But I'll have to think about high school.\\\"\\n\\nAs economically capable Gangnam population moved to this area, Pangyo gained a 'premium image.' Chung Yong-jin, chairman of Shinsegae Group, bought a newlywed home in Baekhyeon-dong, Pangyo in 2012, and as Yoon Ju-hwa, president of Samsung C&T, Moon Gyu-young, chairman of Aju Industries, and others migrated to this area, it began to be called a 'new wealthy town.' The opening of the Shinbundang Line connecting this area and Gangnam was also one reason. As famous IT companies like Daum Kakao, Neowiz, and Nexon established themselves in Pangyo, the economically capable young population also increased. The school district isn't bad either. Students can advance to prestigious high schools in the Bundang area like Seohyeon High, Bundang High, Naksaeng High, Bundang Jungang High, and Daejin High.\\n\\nOn the other hand, interest in Bundang areas like Jeongja-dong and Seohyeon-dong relatively decreased. Bundang's heyday was in the early to mid-2000s when high-priced apartments costing 1-3 billion won [approximately $750,000-2.25 million USD] (30-80 pyeong [approximately 990-2,640 square feet]) like Park View were built, and mixed-use buildings were constructed around Jeongja Station in 2005. Jeongja-dong's cafe street was also formed during this period. However, as Pangyo development began in earnest, housing prices and commercial rent in this area stagnated. The average apartment sales price per 3.3㎡ in Jeongja-dong was about 19 million won [approximately $14,300 USD] in 2006, but dropped to about 17 million won [approximately $12,800 USD] this year. In contrast, the average sales price of apartments in Pangyo's Baekhyeon-dong and Sampyeong-dong areas is 23-26 million won [approximately $17,300-19,500 USD] per pyeong, similar to Seocho-dong in Seocho District (23.72 million won [approximately $17,800 USD]).\\n\\nIncrease in migration to Yongin Suji instead of expensive Pangyo\\n\\nHowever, the number of people migrating from Gangnam to Pangyo is gradually decreasing. The population going from Gangnam to Seongnam, where Pangyo is located, which was 7,402 in 2009, decreased by 40% to 4,555 last year. Among these, the population in their 30s and 40s also decreased by about 35% from 2,995 to 1,961. Ham Yeong-jin, director of Budongsan114 Research Center, analyzed, \\\"As new apartment supply in Pangyo decreased and apartment sales prices and lease deposit prices rose significantly, the burden on tenants increased,\\\" adding \\\"Since people without the economic capacity to handle this cannot enter Pangyo, the growth rate of Pangyo's incoming population has slowed compared to before.\\\"\\n\\nExperts expect that people who cannot afford Pangyo's high housing prices will increasingly migrate to nearby areas like Yongin Suji. Park Won-gap, expert committee member at KB Real Estate, said, \\\"Even people working at companies in Pangyo often go live in Suji because of expensive housing prices,\\\" adding \\\"There are many IT ventures and new companies in Pangyo Techno Valley, and many young people working there want to live in the Pangyo area, so a second new city could be created near Pangyo.\\\" According to Budongsan114, the average sales price per 3.3㎡ in Dongcheon-dong, where apartments are expensive in Suji, is 13.7 million won [approximately $10,300 USD]. 30-40 pyeong [approximately 990-1,320 square feet] apartment prices are in the 400-500 million won [approximately $300,000-375,000 USD] range. While still half the price of Pangyo's Baekhyeon-dong and Sampyeong-dong, prices are gradually rising as the inflowing population increases. Han Mi-ok, representative of Pangyo Samsung Licensed Real Estate Agency, said, \\\"Samsung Heavy Industries R&D Center entered Pangyo Techno Valley last year. Company employees who felt burdened by Pangyo housing prices flocked to apartments in Suji's Dongcheon-dong, Seongbok-dong, and Sinbong-dong, causing those apartment prices to rise by about 500,000-700,000 won [approximately $375-525 USD] per pyeong.\\\" This area also has good transportation. Taking express buses, it takes about an hour to reach Seoul's Gwanghwamun and Gangnam, and when the Shinbundang Line currently under construction opens in February next year, accessibility to Seoul metropolitan area will be much better.\\n\\nHaving prestigious high schools like Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Attached High School and Suji High School nearby is also an advantage. Lim Seong-ho, representative of Jongro Hagwon Sky Education, said, \\\"However, as Suji High School, the representative prestigious high school in this area, became equalized, population inflow of parent age groups could slow down.\\\"\\n\\n▶Changes in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]\\n\\nPopulation decreases in Daechi 1st and 2nd dong, only increases in 4th dong which is the hagwon district\\n\\nPossible to apply to Gangnam prestigious high schools from anywhere in Seoul. Reconstruction construction and rising lease deposit prices also have impact. Population in 4th dong also decreases except for teens and people in their 40s\\n\\nDaechi-dong, representing Gangnam as 'hagwon education [hagwon/tutoring industry] ground zero.' What does population movement in Daechi-dong look like?\\n\\nGangnam Tong-Shin's analysis of Daechi-dong's population changes over the past 10 years showed considerable differences even within Daechi-dong by sub-district.\\n\\nThis is because various factors such as educational system reorganization, housing price fluctuations, and reconstruction had different impacts on each dong. Daechi-dong is divided into Daechi 1st dong, 2nd dong, and 4th dong. Daechi 3rd dong was integrated into Daechi 2nd dong.\\n\\nDaechi 1st dong is the area where prestigious high schools like Dankook University Attached High School are located, and Daechi 2nd dong is the area with Eunma, Sunkyung, and Mido apartments. Both these areas saw population decreases. Over the 10 years from 2005 to 2014, a total of about 5,200 people moved out. Daechi 1st dong's population decreased by 13.9% (3,178 people) from 22,867 to 19,689, and Daechi 2nd dong decreased by 4.7% (2,117 people) from 44,984 to 42,867. Looking by age, teens (middle and high school age) and people in their 40s (parent age) decreased significantly. Particularly in Daechi 2nd dong, while total population decreased by 4.7% over the past 10 years, the population of teens and people in their 40s decreased by much more at 17.5%. The decrease in middle and high school students and parent population was much greater than the overall population decrease. In Daechi 1st dong, while total population decreased by 13.9%, the population of teens and people in their 40s decreased by 14.5%.\\n\\nExperts analyze that the major reason was the implementation of the high school choice system starting in 2010, allowing applications to high schools throughout Seoul, abolishing the nearby assignment principle of assigning students to schools close to home. They also see as a reason that prestigious high schools in this area like Whimoon High and Jungdong High became autonomous private high schools, making them available for application from anywhere in Seoul. Lim Seong-ho, representative of Jongro Hagwon Sky Education, said, \\\"Previously, you had to live in Daechi-dong to be assigned to Whimoon High, but after 2010, as it changed to an autonomous private high school, there was no need to live in expensive Daechi-dong because of school,\\\" adding \\\"Even living in Seocho-dong or Ilwon-dong, you can go to Whimoon, Jungdong, Hyundai, and Sehwa high schools that converted to autonomous private high schools.\\\"\\n\\nA parent of a Whimoon High student in their 40s living in outer Seocho-dong said, \\\"There was no need to live in a relatively small Daechi-dong apartment while bearing the burden of continuously rising lease deposits.\\\"\\n\\nShin Dong-won, academic affairs vice-principal at Whimoon High, said, \\\"After converting from a general high school to an autonomous private high school, students' residences diversified from Daechi-dong to Seocho, Songpa, Gangbuk, Nowon, Seongbuk districts, and others.\\\"\\n\\nAnother factor causing population outflow was continuously rising apartment prices. As lease deposits for Eunma and Woosung apartments rose by hundreds of millions of won [hundreds of thousands of USD], tenants who found it difficult to handle moved to cheaper apartments. Shin Hye-kyung, representative of Daesin Licensed Real Estate Agency in Daechi-dong, analyzed, \\\"It's difficult to completely leave Daechi-dong because of children's education, and many people moved to nearby cheaper or smaller apartments. These people moved between Daechi 1st, 2nd, and 4th dong.\\\"\\n\\nSome reconstruction apartments entering construction also caused people to relocate. Daechi Palace apartment, which began move-ins on the 24th of last month, housed about 1,400 households until 2011, and as reconstruction construction began, many residents moved to metropolitan new cities including Pangyo.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Daechi 4th dong showed population increase unlike Daechi 1st and 2nd dong. Daechi 4th dong population increased by 536 people (2.5%) from 21,297 in 2005 to 21,833 in 2014. However, the population of teens (student age) and people in their 40s (parents) increased by 1,181 people during the same period, recording an 18% growth rate. While the population of teens and people in their 40s increased, the population of other age groups like those in their 20s-30s and 50s-60s decreased significantly.\\n\\nDaechi 4th dong is the villa area and Daechi-dong hagwon district. Shin Yong-su, representative of Woobang Licensed Real Estate Office, said, \\\"Hundreds of college entrance exam [university admissions] hagwons are concentrated in this area, and demand for residence continues to increase because parents don't have to worry about their children's commute and safety.\\\" This area has many studio apartments, two-room units, and villas, making housing prices relatively cheaper compared to Daechi 1st and 2nd dong.\\n\\nDaechi-dong's population outflow and inflow is expected to continue. Representative Shin predicted, \\\"Apartments in this area are likely to begin reconstruction at different times over the next 10 years, so population outflow and inflow will continue.\\\" Representative Lim said, \\\"Some elementary school parents who went to Pangyo or Suji might return to Daechi-dong when their children advance to middle school.\\\"\\n\\nReporters Jo Jin-hyeong and Jeong Hyeon-jin enish@joongang.co.kr\\nRelated article: From 'reading newspaper' to 'viewing newspaper'\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8552, "output_tokens": 5011, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

They look quiet during vacation. Gangnam Communication analyzed the academic levels of middle schools in five districts considered 'education special zones' in Seoul, including Gangnam District, ahead of the middle school admission season. The analysis showed that the concentration toward Gangnam District is growing even stronger. Among Seoul's 25 districts, Gangnam District showed the highest increase in the proportion of students entering special purpose high schools. The number of middle school students moving to Gangnam District was also found to be increasing. We investigated this phenomenon and its causes.\\n\\nSpecial Purpose High School Admissions: Reduced Burden on School Records, Increased Importance of Specs... Gangnam District Middle Schools Show Strength\\n\\nLast year (2015 academic year), one out of every ten students from Seoul who were admitted to four types of special purpose high schools—foreign language high schools, international high schools, science high schools, and schools for the gifted (including nationally selective schools)—was from Gangnam District. While Gangnam District students comprised only 7.8% (194 out of 2,472) of Seoul-area students admitted to the four special purpose high schools in the 2013 academic year, this ratio increased to 10.8% (235 out of 2,181) in the 2015 academic year. This is the result of analyzing the academic levels of Seoul-area middle schools using special purpose high school admission results and academic achievement assessment data in collaboration with Jongro Academy Sky Education, an education specialty company. We also confirmed through Statistics Korea data the phenomenon of increasing middle school student population moving to Gangnam District.\\n\\nOne Out of Every 10 Special Purpose High School Admits from Seoul is from Gangnam District\\nGangnam District students increased from 7.8% to 10.8% in two years, highest increase rate\\nOne out of every 3 middle school students leaving Songpa District goes to Gangnam District\\nLarge academic gaps even within Gangnam District\\nSchools with many transfer students occupy top academic ranks\\nOne out of every 5 middle school students in Seocho District goes to private high schools\\n\\nGangnam District Shows Clear Improvement in Special Purpose High School Admission Results\\n\\nAnalysis of last year's (2015 academic year) admission results for four special purpose high schools—foreign language high schools, international high schools, science high schools, and schools for the gifted—in the Seoul area showed that Gangnam District students increased significantly. Of the 2,181 students from Seoul admitted to the four special purpose high schools last year, 235 (10.8%) were from Gangnam District. This means one out of every ten students was from Gangnam District. Looking only at the number of admits by district, Nowon District actually had more with 240 total students, comprising 11% of all Seoul admits. In terms of average admits per school, Yangcheon District was highest with 10 students (190 students from 19 schools).\\n\\nHowever, Gangnam District showed the highest rate of increase. While the total number of Seoul-area admits decreased by 291 students from 2,472 to 2,181 due to reduced special purpose high school quotas over the past three years, Gangnam District admits actually increased by 41 students. The proportion of Gangnam District students among all Seoul special purpose high school admits increased by 3 percentage points from 7.8% (194 out of 2,472) in the 2013 academic year to 10.8% (235 out of 2,181) in the 2015 academic year. This is the highest increase rate among Seoul's 25 districts. During the same period, Nowon District's proportion increased by only 0.2 percentage points from 10.8% (267 out of 2,472 total admits in 2013) to 11% (240 out of 2,181 in 2015), and Yangcheon District's proportion increased by 0.5 percentage points from 8.2% (202 students) to 8.7% (190 students). While Nowon and Yangcheon Districts saw their admit numbers decrease, Gangnam District's relatively larger increase significantly boosted its share.\\n\\nThe increase in foreign language and international high school admits is particularly notable. During the same period, Gangnam District's proportion of foreign language and international high school admits rose by 3.2 percentage points (31 students) from 5.7% (116 students) to 8.9% (147 students). Admissions experts attribute this to changes in foreign language and international high school admission processes. Starting from the 2015 academic year, foreign language and international high schools began using absolute evaluation for 2nd-year English school records. However, 3rd-year English school records still use the existing rank-based 9-grade system (top 4% receive Grade 1). Absolute evaluation gives an A grade if the combined score of written exams and performance assessments totals 90 points or above. In the past, when foreign language and international high school admissions used relative evaluation for both 2nd and 3rd-year English school records, it was difficult to receive Grade 1 in Gangnam District due to intense internal competition among high-achieving students.\\n\\nLim Seong-ho, CEO of Jongro Academy Sky Education, analyzed: 'As foreign language and international high school admissions began using absolute evaluation for 2nd-year grades, the school record burden for Gangnam District students was alleviated. English school record management became somewhat easier compared to the past, leading to improved foreign language and international high school admission results for Gangnam District students.'\\n\\nGangnam District's dominance is even more pronounced for science high schools and schools for the gifted. In the 2015 academic year science high school and school for the gifted admissions, Gangnam District students comprised 16.7% (88 students) of Seoul-area admits. One out of every 6 students from Seoul entering science high schools and schools for the gifted was from Gangnam District. Science high schools and schools for the gifted conduct visit and group interviews to assess applicants' mathematics and science inquiry abilities and administer oral exams evaluating creativity and advanced learning during their admission processes. CEO Lim explained: 'Science high school and school for the gifted admissions have a structure where applicants' specs inevitably become apparent during visit and group interview processes, no matter how much the government prohibits using specs from internal and external competitions. There are advantageous aspects for Gangnam District students who have good hagwon education environments for mathematics and science specialization and who begin preparing for science high schools and schools for the gifted from elementary school through gifted education centers.'\\n\\nSongpa District Weakness, Intensified Concentration Toward Gangnam and Seocho Districts\\n\\nAmong the three Gangnam districts of Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa, Songpa District uniquely shows weakness in special purpose high school admissions. The proportion of Songpa District students among Seoul-area admits to the four special purpose high schools decreased by 0.9 percentage points (46 students) from 8.7% (216 students) in the 2013 academic year to 7.8% (170 students) in the 2015 academic year. This was the third-highest decrease rate among Seoul's 25 districts, after Gwangjin District (7.1% → 5%) and Gangdong District (4.6% → 3%).\\n\\nThe number of Songpa District middle school students moving to other districts is also increasing. Movement to Gangnam District is particularly high. Looking at the 2012-2014 migration data (Statistics Korea) for ages 10-14 residing in Songpa District, internal movement within Songpa District was highest, followed by outmigration to Gangnam District. Among ages 10-14 who moved from Songpa District to other districts, the proportion moving to Gangnam District increased every year: 18.2% (530 students) in 2012, 20.9% (519 students) in 2013, and 30.7% (776 students) in 2014. In 2014, one out of every 3 people aged 10-14 who left Songpa District went to Gangnam District. Songpa District parents say: 'While Songpa District is an education special zone, it's true that it falls short compared to Gangnam District level. Many parents would move to Gangnam District if circumstances allowed.' Ms. Jang (42), who sends her middle school 2nd-year child to a Songpa District middle school, conveyed the atmosphere: 'Even for the same hagwon, there's a quality difference between hagwons located in Songpa District and hagwons in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] in Gangnam District. Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwons organize classes meticulously from levels 1-6 to provide instruction perfectly matched to student levels, but Songpa District hagwons only have about 3-4 class divisions due to fewer students.'\\n\\nThe concentration of private high schools and general high schools with good university admission results like Joongdong, Hyundai, and Whimoon high schools in Gangnam District also fuels the Gangnam District concentration phenomenon. Looking at Seoul National University admission results for Seoul-area general high schools in the 2015 academic year, Gangnam District general high schools sent an average of 11.2 students per school to Seoul National University, while Songpa District general high schools averaged only 4.2 Seoul National University admits per school. <JoongAng Ilbo Gangnam Communication, November 25, 2015, pages 10-11, 'The Secret of General High Schools That Sent Many Students to Seoul National University in 2015'> Mr. Han (46), who is raising two children—a 6th grader and a middle school 2nd grader—in Songpa District, said: 'Many parents move to Gangnam District during middle school with an eye toward university admissions even more than special purpose high schools.' Mr. Han explained: 'Even living in Songpa District, we consider Gangnam schools when thinking about high school advancement. The current atmosphere is to move to Gangnam if you have the ability to survive the school record competition there, and to stay in Songpa District to secure school record grades if your ability is lacking.'\\n\\nSeocho District has many students who transferred from Dongjak District. Looking at the 2012-2014 migration data for ages 10-14 into Seocho District, internal movement within Seocho District was highest, followed by students who moved from Dongjak District. Among students who moved to Seocho District from other districts, those from Dongjak District comprised 16.8% (445 students) in 2012, 15.8% (462 students) in 2013, and 17.7% (447 students) in 2014. CEO Lim explained: 'There are many transfers of Songpa District middle school students to Gangnam District and Dongjak District middle school students to Seocho District. Many families rent for 3-4 years to live in the Gangnam area for university admissions and return to their original areas after university entrance exams end.'\\n\\nCommon to all three Gangnam districts—Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa—general high school enrollment decreased while private high school enrollment rates increased. The rate of Gangnam District middle school graduates entering private high schools increased from 11.8% (824 students) in the 2013 academic year to 13.5% (848 students) in the 2015 academic year. Meanwhile, general high school enrollment rates decreased from 81% (5,641 students) to 77.7% (4,884 students) during the same period. Seocho District middle school students' private high school enrollment rate increased from 17.1% (844 students) to 19.2% (878 students), and Songpa District increased from 9.2% (765 students) to 10.1% (767 students). Kim Hye-nam, a teacher at Munil High School in Seoul, analyzed: 'Particularly in the Gangnam area where preference for science and medical fields is pronounced, preference for private high schools with good medical school admission results has increased significantly.'\\n\\nLarge Academic Achievement Gaps Even Within Education Special Zones\\n\\nIn the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Achievement taken by 3rd-year middle school students last year, middle school students in Gangnam District showed an 88.5% rate of proficient or above academic achievement (combined Korean, English, mathematics). The Academic Achievement Assessment is an indicator for gauging schools' average academic levels, dividing achievement into three levels: proficient or above, basic, and below basic according to achievement level. Proficient or above academic achievement means achieving 50% or more of the national curriculum achievement goals. It refers to an academic level that can smoothly follow the curriculum when advancing to the next grade. This means 88.5% of Gangnam District middle school students met this condition. Seocho District showed 87.8%, Songpa District 81.1%, Yangcheon District 79.1%, and Nowon District 78.1%.\\n\\nAcademic Achievement Assessment results by middle school show gaps widening again within each district. In Gangnam District, schools ranked in order: Daecheong Middle (97.9%), Daewang Middle (95.8%), Jinseon Girls' Middle (94.3%), Apgujeong Middle (94.2%), and Daemyeong Middle (94%). Eonbuk Middle showed the lowest level with a proficient or above rate of only 69.5%. Even within Gangnam District, the gap between the highest-achieving school (Daecheong Middle, 97.9%) and lowest-achieving school (Eonbuk Middle, 69.5%) was 28.4 percentage points. Seocho District showed a 23.2% gap, and Songpa District showed 30.3% (excluding Seoul Sports Middle School, which specializes in physical education).\\n\\nExperts cite three main factors related to Academic Achievement Assessment gaps: influx of excellent students from outside, hagwon education, and academic atmosphere. Indeed, Daemyeong Middle, Daecheong Middle, and Jinseon Girls' Middle, which showed high academic achievement results in Gangnam District, ranked 1st, 2nd, and 4th respectively among Gangnam District middle schools for net student influx (number of transfer-in students minus transfer-out students) from 2012-2014. Daemyeong Middle increased by 99 students over three years, Daecheong Middle by 98 students, and Jinseon Girls' Middle by 86 students.\\n\\nLooking at Gangnam District overall, net student influx for middle schools increased significantly from 100 to 376 students during the same period. Conversely, Songpa District had more students transferring out than in, recording negative net influx of -52 students in 2012, -85 students in 2013, and -145 students in 2014, with the negative gap continuing to widen. A vice-principal at a Gangnam middle school said: 'The effect of hagwon education cannot be ignored. Top-tier students clustering together creates an academic atmosphere, naturally having a large effect of pulling up mid-tier students.' Lee Seong-kwon, representative of the Korean Education Policy Teachers' Solidarity (teacher at Daejin High School in Seoul), said: 'The concentration phenomenon toward specific regions and specific schools could intensify further. It's urgent to increase support for schools with low Academic Achievement Assessment results and for schools to make efforts to raise the academic levels of students who fall short of basic achievement.'\\n\\nWritten by=Jeong Hyeon-jin, Jeon Min-hee, Kim Min-gwan reporters Jeong.hyeonjin@joongang.co.kr Photos by=Kim Gyeong-rok reporter kimkr8486@joongang.co.kr\\n[Cover Story]▶What Did CEOs in Their 30s and 40s Receive From Their Fathers?▶Diary That Makes Dreams Reality▶Reply 2015: Your Moments\\n▶Click here to see more Gangnam Communication articles\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 7329, "output_tokens": 3923, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

He recited it saying that his life was contained in the fifteen characters of the verse 'Going down, I saw / what I couldn't see going up / that flower.' The grandfather we met again this year told us, \\\"If you want to be treated well, first serve and treat others well.\\\" \\\"Having gotten older, I realize this saying is the true truth of human relationships.\\\"\\n\\nHe smiled broadly saying that after his story was introduced in Gangnam Tongsin, \\\"I received countless congratulatory contacts from middle and high school classmates I had forgotten about, neighboring residents, and hagwon instructors.\\\" \\\"Close friends teased me saying 'Hey, you even made it to the newspaper and became successful,' and people I met in society praised me saying 'Brother, seeing your story, you're an amazing person,'\\\" and \\\"I didn't know that so many people would see the brief article that went in the newspaper.\\\"\\n\\nThere was also an unforgettable incident. \\\"An unknown number kept calling me, so I didn't answer at first. When I finally answered, it was a grandmother who said she had read my newspaper article and was battling terminal cancer. The part where I got a new life through prayer during my blindness crisis must have been impressive to her.\\\" He encouraged the grandmother he had never met through phone calls for several months. \\\"I told her not to receive chemotherapy if it was too hard. At our age, the day we'll go isn't far off anyway. Instead of treatment, I recommended that she live a life of faith, empty her mind, and reflect on the days she had lived.\\\" A few months later, he received a call from someone claiming to be the grandmother's son. \\\"He said 'Mother passed away peacefully' and thanked me. The son who lived in America had seen my newspaper article first and told his mother 'Please take a look at this.' Being featured once in a newspaper gave me such an amazing experience.\\\"\\n\\nHe became even more popular among students. One female student who started attending the hagwon this year has been friendly from the first day, saying \\\"My mom told me to greet the grandfather well when I go to hagwon.\\\" \\\"That student's mother was moved by reading my article. Whenever things like this happen, I'm so grateful and amazed that I'm moved every day.\\\"\\n\\nWhen asked about changes from two years ago to now, he said it was \\\"working harder and more joyfully.\\\" He comes to work every day at 6:30 AM, turns on lights from the top floor of the hagwon building, and turns on heaters to warm the air. He checks if there's any trash, if any supplies are lacking, greets everyone coming and going with a 45-degree bow, and looks at each child's face, and before he knows it, it's 10 PM. \\\"This year, having appeared in the newspaper once more, I want to live more humbly and serve others more. Thank you.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Park Hyung-soo hspark97@joongang.co.kr\\n\\nRitz-Carlton Doorman Son Kwang-nam: I felt rewarded when a guest said \\\"It's good that you're here\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After the article came out, many people recognized me. I heard a lot of people say I was excellent. It was the first time I'd heard such things. I heard a lot of people say 'We thought doormen worked in shabby and poor conditions, but after seeing the newspaper, we realized you do truly excellent work, it's amazing.' One elderly person said 'It's good that you're here,' which really made me feel good.\\\"\\n\\nSharing my article across all Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide\\nBecame a more proud father to hotelier eldest daughter\\n\\nSon Kwang-nam (59), Ritz-Carlton Seoul Door Desk Supervisor (section chief), smiled shyly. Having guarded the hotel as a doorman for over 30 years from Namseoul Hotel (now Ritz-Carlton Seoul) in 1984 until now, he was the protagonist of the first article in the 'Your History' series that started on August 20, 2014. After the article was published, there were many positive reactions. Most hotel-related articles had been interviews with high-ranking positions like general managers or executive chefs, but that article was about someone working close to customers. A Ritz-Carlton headquarters official who read this article was impressed by how it incorporated Seoul's history and culture into the life of a Ritz-Carlton gentleman (*Ritz-Carlton calls employees gentlemen and ladies) and shared the article with all 90 chains worldwide.\\n\\nThe family was most happy to see the article. Especially his eldest daughter, who works as a hotelier, became even more proud of her father. Section Chief Son said, \\\"There are many study-abroad graduates among hoteliers, but my daughter, who never studied abroad, is recognized and works well at the hotel, which makes me proud. Also, I'm happy that she doesn't feel ashamed of having a father who works as a doorman but says he's excellent.\\\"\\n\\nHe still does his best in his position as he did two years ago. Although he's the doorman with the longest career in the domestic hotel industry, he still has information about 3,000 customer vehicles. The secret is studying customer faces and related information every morning like memorizing English vocabulary by flipping through newspapers. When Ritz-Carlton Seoul opened in 1995, he became famous in the industry. This was because he would look at customers coming out of the lobby and immediately call out their vehicle numbers to summon their cars. The fact that he would recognize them first and prepare their vehicles before being asked became known, and other hotels would come to benchmark his methods.\\n\\nThanks to staying in one position, among past presidents, he has opened doors for all except the late Presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee. His kind service doesn't discriminate by age, gender, status, or position. For children who are curious seeing him wearing a large hat, he salutes them once more. He also manages himself thoroughly. After work, he exercises for 30 minutes to maintain his physical strength.\\n\\nSaying his shoulders became even heavier after the article was published, he said, \\\"I want to continue working as a doorman as long as my abilities allow\\\" and \\\"Meeting customers makes me happy.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Song Jeong song.jeong@joongang.co.kr\\n\\n27-year veteran firefighter Baek Gyun-heum: Special lecture at alma mater... I was proud of the interest in firefighters\\n\\nWeight 40kg... This is the average weight when a firefighter is fully equipped with air breathing apparatus, fire suit, ax, and all equipment necessary for fire suppression and life rescue. Firefighters run through flames carrying 40kg of equipment. In midsummer, just putting on and taking off the fire suit briefly often results in being drenched in sweat. Baek Gyun-heum (50), a fire lieutenant at Neungdong 119 Safety Center in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, says \\\"40kg isn't that heavy.\\\" \\\"What's heavy is when I couldn't save someone, that feeling that fills my chest like a lead weight...\\\"\\n\\nReceiving desk assignment but picking up fire hose again after one month\\nYou're working hard, thank you - I can't leave the field because of those words\\n\\nWe met him again one year and two months after introducing him in the November 26, 2014 'Your History' section of Gangnam Tongsin. It was near his home in Jayang-dong at 6 PM on the 17th. He might have been tired after working an overnight shift and getting off work that morning, but he greeted us warmly. \\\"Hey, brother, have you been well?\\\" \\\"Sorry, hyung. I haven't been able to greet you properly...\\\" Even though this younger brother who had become close during the reporting process and agreed to call each other hyung-dongsaeng hadn't called once to say hello, he laughed heartily saying \\\"It's okay. As long as you're healthy and living well.\\\" That day too, he came out holding his 'sister-in-law's' (Lim Seon-mi, 45) hand tightly. (※During the three previous interviews for reporting, he always came out holding his wife Lim's hand tightly. To him, a firefighter who risks his life at work, his wife is both his greatest supporter and companion.)\\n\\nFire Lieutenant Baek is a 27-year veteran firefighter. After completing 8 years as a suppression captain at Gangnam Fire Station, he was assigned to Seongsu 119 Safety Center in Gwangjin-gu last July, worked there for 6 months, and now works at Neungdong 119 Safety Center. He says he received encouraging phone calls from countless places after his article appeared in Gangnam Tongsin. \\\"You're working hard. Thank you... With just those words, I get strength again. When I'm helpful to someone, I get addicted to that feeling of pride, which is why I do firefighting work. Haha.\\\" After the article was published, he was also invited to a career special lecture at his alma mater, Konkuk University High School. \\\"It's something to be proud of. Among names of impressive people like lawyers and CEOs, my name was right there, which really felt good. I'm grateful that people show such interest in firefighters.\\\"\\n\\nHe still carries minor injuries like scratches or bone fractures as part of daily life. Falling from 2nd or 3rd floors during fire suppression is routine. He says it would be more embarrassing for a firefighter to complain about being injured from such minor wounds. His wife Lim complained, \\\"It would be nice if he were more careful now, but this person can't be satisfied unless he's the first to jump into any fire he sees.\\\"\\n\\nAs it turns out, there was a story in between. After 6 months at Seongsu 119 Safety Center, he was assigned to the Disaster Management Division at Gwangjin Fire Station for desk work. It was to give him a brief rest in recognition of his hard work. But he quit desk work after just one month. \\\"Running around in the field is in my nature... Ugh, I was so restless I couldn't do that kind of work.\\\" That's how he came to Neungdong 119 Safety Center now. Fire Lieutenant Baek still takes on the role of lead hose operator, holding the fire hose and being the first to enter fire scenes. Even though he's over 50 and fire scenes might be physically demanding, he still arrives first at fire scenes. \\\"I might fall behind the young guys in strength now, but I now have the know-how to distinguish just by smell from outside a house whether food on a gas range is burning or if it's a real fire. My dream is to guard fire scenes until mandatory retirement.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Jeong Hyeon-jin Jeong.hyeonjin@joongang.co.kr\\n\\nKorea's No. 1 Sommelier Seo Han-jeong: Wine columns on Gangnam Tongsin SNS - this is life's pleasure\\n\\nWe met Seo Han-jeong, Korea's first sommelier and founding president of the Korea Wine Association, last March when spring was ripening. We decided to include Seo's story, which represents the history of Korean wine, in the March 25, 2015 'Your History.' Since retiring from Shilla Hotel in 2008, he worked as a consultant for 3 years, then from 2012 has been spending his later years in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, still talking about wine and tending soybean fields.\\n\\nKakaoStory serialization 'Seo Han-jeong's Wine? Wine!'\\nWine isn't difficult, just enjoy drinking it\\n\\nTo the reporter who visited his home for an interview, he said, \\\"After retirement, except for occasionally giving wine lectures or going abroad when foreign wineries invite me, I spend time doing farm work like this. Come visit Pocheon in summer, Gangnam Tongsin reporters. Let's roast soybeans I grew and have a glass of wine. Don't think wine is difficult. As long as I can drink it enjoyably and deliciously, that's enough.\\\"\\n\\nAfter the article was published, comments like 'Nice to see a familiar face,' 'He was my teacher,' and 'I remember the nostalgic Maison wine commercial' appeared online. This connection led to starting a serialization called 'Seo Han-jeong Wine? Wine!' on Gangnam Tongsin's KakaoStory from April 22, 2015, just one month after the interview was published. It's a corner where Seo Han-jeong personally selects wines to introduce every Friday, covering everything from how to drink wine (which can seem difficult) to wine stories, and introducing dishes that pair well with the recommended wines. In September 2015, they held a wine class for 16 invited readers to enjoy with Seo Han-jeong.\\n\\nCalled Korea's top sommelier, he studies wine-related books and etiquette every day even at age 70.\\n\\n\\\"Constantly learning and teaching what you've learned to others - isn't that life's pleasure? Places with wine are always happy and joyful. I think of enjoying wine with Gangnam Tongsin readers every week. The marriage of Gangnam Tongsin and wine is also fantastic. Gangnam Tongsin and I also have a really good relationship.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Kim So-yeop kim.soyub@joongang.co.kr\\n\\nElderly beauty volunteer Kim Jeong-soon: It's not amazing, I volunteered for myself\\n\\n\\\"People say it's amazing.\\\"\\n\\nA calm, short answer. These are the words of Kim Jeong-soon (63), who has been doing beauty volunteer work for 20 years for elderly, disabled people, burn patients, and others with mobility difficulties. When asked about changes since being introduced in the January 13 'People Captured by Gangnam Tongsin' corner, she answered like this.\\n\\nThe joy of making others happy is so great...\\nHave to stop volunteering to care for mother and grandchild\\n\\nHer simple words made me think 'still the same.' It was the same when I first met her through the introduction of Gangnam-gu Volunteer Center. When asked 'How could you volunteer for such a long time,' she coolly dismissed it saying \\\"What's so amazing about that?\\\" She volunteered for over 20 years in terms of years, over 5,200 hours in terms of time. In a world where people struggle to take care of their own bodies and families, volunteering for strangers for such a long time is amazing by anyone's standards. But Kim just said \\\"it's nothing special.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What would I do just sitting at home? I don't like shopping and I don't like gathering to chat. I like meeting elderly people and hearing their life stories. It's interesting. And when I cut their hair, they look so neat and nice. When their disheveled appearance becomes clean, I feel good and the elderly and patients are happy. Then I feel good too. That's why I volunteered. It's not amazing.\\\"\\n\\nKim's story received good responses not only in print but also online and on SNS. Kim said, \\\"Family and friends all said I was great. They knew I was volunteering but didn't know I had done it for so long. When my son said 'our mom is amazing,' that was enjoyable. My in-laws also called saying I was amazing.\\\"\\n\\nKim first started volunteering on Day of the Disabled in 1997. After following a friend to start pushing wheelchairs for disabled people, she has continued volunteer activities 2-3 days a week without missing a single week until now. She learned beauty skills and regularly visits 3 nursing hospitals and 5 welfare centers to trim the hair of elderly with dementia and stroke, and disabled people. She also directly visits homes of elderly with mobility difficulties.\\n\\nAfter starting volunteer work, her life flowed as precisely as clockwork. Every day she wakes up at 4:30 AM, exercises at home for about an hour, and finishes cleaning, laundry (※she doesn't use a washing machine and does all laundry by hand), and preparing breakfast at exactly 7:50 AM. After sending her 90-year-old mother with dementia to the day care center, it's 8:30 AM. Then she would go to nursing hospitals, welfare centers, and burn specialty hospitals to do beauty volunteer work. She returns home around 5:30 PM when her mother returns from the center. Then she cares for her mother and starts meals and housework for the family.\\n\\nHowever, she plans to stop her 20-year volunteer activities at the end of this December. It's to care for a grandchild to be born in May. She needs to care for both her mother and grandchild, so it's difficult to continue volunteering. Kim said, \\\"The hospital directors and welfare center directors where I volunteer tell me to bring the baby, but how could I do that? But what worries me most are the elderly and patients who will be waiting for me,\\\" showing her disappointment.\\n\\nShe then said she had something to tell people about volunteering. \\\"Volunteering isn't for others, it's for myself. The joy gained by making others happy is so great. And although I have to stop unavoidably, the important thing is to continue without stopping.\\\"\\n\\nReporter Yoon Gyeong-hee annie@joongang.co.kr\\n\\nHwang Seung-gu, who got re-employed at 65: Seeing myself in the newspaper felt like being rewarded for past efforts\\n\\nOne year and two months ago, the heart of Hwang Seung-gu, research fellow at University of Science and Technology (UST), was half excitement, half fear. After two years of unemployment, he succeeded in re-employment at age 65, but along with the passion of 'I can do anything,' he was worried about 'having to adapt to a new environment.' \\\"It was during this time that I received an interview request from JoongAng Ilbo Gangnam Tongsin. I readily agreed thinking it would be an opportunity to look back on the past and strengthen my resolve for the future.\\\"\\n\\nStarting work again and fully enjoying the joy of labor\\nOne-year contract research fellow recently renewed contract\\n\\nHe honestly shared his post-retirement life and re-employment process in the interview. After leaving the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials where he had worked for 34 years ending in December 2012, he rested for a year then became a re-job seeker in 2014. During this period, he accessed job posting sites for 1-2 hours daily and submitted applications whenever opportunities arose. His efforts bore fruit after six rejections.\\n\\nThis re-employment success story was introduced in the January 7, 2015 JoongAng Ilbo Gangnam Tongsin. It was a photo book format newspaper specially produced for the 2015 New Year. The theme 'New Start' perfectly matched his situation. \\\"After being introduced in the newspaper, I received congratulations from many people around me. Both daughters said 'We're proud of dad,' and I also heard from acquaintances that 'your always challenging attitude is beautiful.'\\\"\\n\\nBut most of all, being able to resolve to 'work hard' was the greatest gift for him. \\\"Seeing the printed page with my photo made me feel rewarded for past efforts. I thought I should look at this newspaper whenever there are crises while working and pull myself together.\\\"\\n\\nSince then, his life became a bit busier. From August last year, he has also been participating in the Machinery Expert Cooperative consisting of about 40 retirees from Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials. His main work is giving advice on publishing a book showing the research institute's 40-year history. \\\"When I was resting after retirement, I didn't know the preciousness of 'rest.' After starting work again, I came to fully enjoy the joy of labor and the sweetness of rest.\\\"\\n\\nHe also renewed his contract with UST, which had been a one-year contract position. His job is connecting UST contract department students with industries and research institutes, and he feels proud just thinking that his efforts help someone.\\n\\nTalking with him reminded me of a line from the movie 'The Intern' released last year. It's from the self-introduction letter when 70-year-old retiree Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applied for an internship. 'Musicians never retire. They stop when the music disappears. There's still music left in me.' For him too, retirement seemed unlikely for the time being. His challenge is still ongoing.\\n\\nReporter Jeon Min-hee jeon.minhee@joongang.co.kr\\n\\nGangnam Tongsin's Past Three Years\\n\\nStarting February 20, 2013, Gangnam Tongsin has worked for three years to deliver new news befitting its name 'connecting with newness' (tongsin·通新). Beyond stories of famous people, it introduced ordinary people's lives and delivered cutting-edge trends across regional issues, education, and lifestyle. We looked back at the stories Gangnam Tongsin has captured over the past three years.\\n\\nThe 'Your History' series (August 20, 2014 - September 23, 2015) was a project highlighting ordinary people's lives. Starting with hotel doorman Son Kwang-nam with 30 years of experience, it wove together modern Korean history through stories of 48 people who weren't famous but were masters in their respective fields - including actor Oh Soon-taek, the first Korean to advance to Hollywood, and Kim Hwa-ja, Hyundai Motor's first female executive - people who devoted their lives to one profession. Currently, it's running the 'Greatest Legacy' series starting with the story of robotics professor Dennis Hong and his parents, Inha University emeritus professors Hong Yong-sik and Min Byeong-hee (November 4, 2015 issue). It introduces families' spiritual legacies that are inherited from parents and that one wants to pass on to children.\\n\\nCosmetics Battle has been Gangnam Tongsin's longest-running corner, conducted 84 times from 2013 until now. It investigates the best-selling cosmetics from various distribution channels including department stores, drug stores, and online shopping malls, then reporters directly try the products and critically review them. Unlike other magazines and broadcasts that only highlight advantages, it evaluates pros and cons without reservation, making it an unwelcome corner for cosmetics industry officials, but readers give positive reviews for its honest and 'harsh' evaluations.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 12355, "output_tokens": 5975, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Her goal is not college admission, but passing the civil service exam. She plans to take on the Grade 9 civil service recruitment exam to be held early next year. \\\"Even though they say civil service exams are 'harder than getting a camel through the eye of a needle,' if I study diligently, there's no reason I can't do it, right?\\\" Lee's grades place her in the top 10% at her school.\\n\\nLee hasn't dreamed of becoming a civil servant for very long. \\\"Until recently, all I wanted was to become someone who could positively influence others,\\\" she said. So she studied hard for her school records and consistently ranked at the top. She too thought she would go to university.\\n\\nThen one day, her mindset changed. Last summer, a career aptitude test conducted at school showed that jobs delivering public services, like civil servant or social worker, suited her well. Since that day, the three characters 'civil servant' haven't left her mind. Also, it overlapped with the world of the correctional officer (prison guard) who appeared as a supporting character in the movie <Harmony> she had seen sometime before, and her desire to become a civil servant began to sprout in her heart. What captivated Lee in this movie was the supporting character Lieutenant Gong Na-young (played by Lee Da-hee). \\\"The way she didn't discriminate against or look down on the prisoners, but rather empathized with their sadness, was impressive. Ah, I thought, what if I helped people in that way too?\\\"\\n\\nWhen her thoughts reached this point, doubts about college admission came flooding in. 'Since civil servants can apply regardless of whether they're college or high school graduates, what's the point of spending money to get a college diploma?' This thought solidified further as she watched her older brother, who had delayed college graduation for a year due to unemployment and was living as a semi-unemployed person. Lee said, \\\"Every time my brother says 'I want to get a job quickly so I can quit my part-time work,' it breaks my heart.\\\"\\n\\n**Civil servant ranks #1 as 'popular job' among middle and high school students**\\n\\nLee's decision is quite different from the atmosphere among high school students who are all focused on college admission. In fact, the college enrollment rate among Korean high school students in 2014 was 70.9%. This means 7 out of 10 high school students choose to go to college. However, compared to the 84% college enrollment rate in 2008, this is a decrease of about 13 percentage points. This is evidence that more and more high school students are choosing paths other than college admission.\\n\\nAmong them, high school students like Lee who prepare for civil service exams early have increased markedly. On the internet, a new coined word 'gongding,' referring to 'high school students and repeat test-takers [students retaking CSAT after high school graduation] preparing for civil service exams,' has even emerged.\\n\\nAccording to the Ministry of Personnel Management, 222,650 people submitted applications for this year's national Grade 9 civil service recruitment exam. This is the largest scale since the Grade 9 recruitment exam was implemented in 1949. Among them, applicants aged 18-19 increased by about 1,000 people in one year, from 2,160 to 3,156. The proportion of teenagers among all applicants also increased from 1.1% to 1.4%. Behind this increase in 'gongding' lies the phenomenon of civil servant preference. According to the '2015 Social Survey' conducted by Statistics Korea, 1 in 4 middle and high school students preferred civil servant as their desired job. Civil servant ranked first, beating out other occupations.\\n\\nAlong with this, the 'vocational institutionalization' of universities and the increase in unemployed college graduates also fuel the increase in gongding. According to '2015 Youth Statistics,' 48.6% of youth (ages 9-24) in 2014 answered that the main purpose of university-level education is 'to get a good job.' 'Developing one's abilities and talents' was 36%, and 'building character or cultivation' was only 1.8%.\\n\\nThe reality of having to pay enormous time and costs for job preparation even after college admission is also cited as one of the causes of mass production of the gongding tribe. According to survey results from 'University Tomorrow's 20s Research Institute,' college students preparing for employment are preparing an average of 5.2 specs per person and spent an average of 1,304,000 won [approximately $980 USD] on employment-related course fees. Despite this, the number of college students frustrated at the threshold of employment has instead increased. Last year's unemployment rate among college graduates was 3.6%, an increase of 0.4 percentage points (about 90,000 people) compared to 3.2% in 2012.\\n\\nWhat served as a catalyst for the increase in the gongding tribe was the 2013 revision of the Grade 9 civil service exam. Administrative law general principles and public administration introduction, which were mandatory subjects, were changed to elective subjects, and high school curriculum subjects like social studies, science, and mathematics were added as elective subjects. As subjects overlapping with school classes increased, more high school students turned their attention to the Grade 9 civil service exam.\\n\\nAn official from A Civil Service Academy in Noryangjin said, \\\"High school students and repeat test-takers who come for consultations with their parents account for 3 out of 10 consultees in January and February,\\\" describing the changed landscape. \\\"What has visibly changed is the composition of students. Three years ago, there were almost no students of high school age. But now, 1 or 2 out of 10 students are high schoolers or repeat test-takers.\\\"\\n\\nCases like Lee's, where students enter general high school then give up university and prepare for civil service, are not common. This is because the opportunity cost of giving up college admission feels too great to jump into preparing for the highly competitive civil service exam. However, the story could be different for gongding who switched direction early.\\n\\nMost third-year students in the civil service exam preparation class at Daedong Tax High School have aimed to become civil servants since middle school. They knocked on the door of this specialized high school to take the exam through the 'Regional Talent Grade 9 Track' rather than the open competitive exam.\\n\\nThe Regional Talent Grade 9 Track, implemented since 2012, is a system that separately selects Grade 9 civil servants limited to specialized high schools, Meister schools, and junior colleges. Only 5 people recommended by the principal per school can apply. The competition rate is lower than the Grade 9 recruitment exam, they only need to compete among peers, and two subjects are excluded from the exam, making it advantageous in many ways. The Ministry of Personnel Management announced it would select 160 people through the Regional Talent Grade 9 Track this year. This is the highest number ever.\\n\\n**'Future talents' preparing since middle school**\\n\\nHowever, not everyone who wants to can apply for this track. The qualification conditions needed to be selected among the 5 people per school are strict. For 'general subjects' like Korean, English, and mathematics, all subjects must rank within the top 30%, and for 'specialized subjects' like tax law and accounting principles, all subjects must be B or above, with more than half being higher than A.\\n\\nKim Tae-hyeon (17), who was in the top 15% of his middle school graduation grades, gave up college admission early due to his father's unemployment. His father, a high school graduate who worked at a cement manufacturing company, lost his job during company restructuring in the mid-2000s.\\n\\nStruggling with family finances, Kim eventually had to give up his dream of college admission. Instead, he set out to find a stable job possible with a high school diploma. \\\"Civil servant was truly the optimal job for me,\\\" Kim emphasized. \\\"When I was in third year of middle school, I had the opportunity to attend a specialized high school information session. After hearing that 'Daedong Tax High School has a high civil service exam pass rate nationwide,' I immediately decided to enroll.\\\"\\n\\nKang Seong-su (17) was also familiar with the civil servant profession from a young age. Kang said, \\\"Since both my grandfather and father worked in public service, the civil servant profession wasn't unfamiliar to me.\\\" He 'declared' to his parents in his second year of middle school that he would prepare to become a civil servant. Kang's older sister is also a specialized high school graduate who currently works at a financial company. \\\"If my sister had gone to a general high school, she probably couldn't have gotten into her desired university. But at her current job, they say she can get university admission qualifications after working for 3 years. When you think about it, it's actually advantageous for college admission too.\\\"\\n\\nKang's mother said she's the object of envy among her friends. \\\"We practically have no money going out for education expenses. There's no time I'm more proud than when I hear people around me say, 'How nice that your child goes to a good school for free.'\\\" According to the 'hagwon education Expenditure Survey' announced annually by Statistics Korea, the monthly average hagwon education expenditure per high school student in 2014 was 230,000 won [approximately $173 USD].\\n\\nLike Kim and Kang, students in the civil service exam preparation class all thought about their future from a young age and decided their career path themselves. This point contrasts with the Korea Press Foundation Media Research Center survey where students chose parents most often (56.8%) as 'the person who has the greatest influence on career decisions.'\\n\\nPerhaps because of this, they have strong will regarding independence and success. Kim, who receives about 100,000 won [approximately $75 USD] in allowance per month, said, \\\"Every time I get allowance from my parents, I feel sorry and burdened.\\\" Kang also said, \\\"The reason I want to become a civil servant quickly is so I can stop receiving allowance from my parents and actually give money to them instead.\\\"\\n\\nYoon Min-ho (17), who said \\\"I want to show my parents a successful side of myself,\\\" is the same way. He said, \\\"When I was young, perhaps due to an inferiority complex, I often thought my parents favored my older sister.\\\" \\\"From then on, I sought out external activities myself to show my parents something. Later, I would organize my thoughts first, then go to my parents to ask for help.\\\"\\n\\nNot only high school students, but repeat test-takers jumping into civil service exams have also greatly increased. This year's Grade 9 civil service recruitment exam will be held on April 9. From the repeat test-takers' perspective, they have the burden of taking another exam just months after taking CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] last year. Their mindset differs slightly from high school students. Myeong Su-min (18), who has been preparing for the Grade 9 civil service exam since taking CSAT last year, explained, \\\"Because the future is much more uncertain.\\\"\\n\\n**Anxious repeat test-takers also join in**\\n\\nOriginally, Myeong's goal was to enter the English Education department at a top university in Seoul. However, in last year's CSAT, he received an average of Grade 4. For Myeong, who had easily surpassed an average of Grade 2 in mock exams, this was a report card he absolutely could not accept. Both school teachers and hagwon instructors had encouraged him, saying \\\"You'll be fine if you just reduce mistakes.\\\"\\n\\nEven so, he couldn't easily decide to repeat. There was no guarantee the same thing wouldn't happen again as last year. Looking toward only the CSAT, which is taken once a year, and deciding to repeat felt like 'gambling.' While he was unable to decide on a direction and was worrying, his older sister made an unexpected suggestion: \\\"If you're really anxious, how about preparing for the civil service exam first?\\\" Myeong said, \\\"The subjects weren't very different from CSAT, and I was drawn to the fact that you can take the civil service exam three times a year.\\\"\\n\\nFor Myeong, the civil service exam is a kind of 'insurance.' Though it's been three months since he started preparing for the civil service exam, he still doesn't think being a civil servant suits his aptitude. He also has plans to prepare for CSAT anytime if he fails the civil service exam. \\\"Even if I become a civil servant, I definitely plan to get a bachelor's degree through night university or cyber university,\\\" is his aspiration.\\n\\nHaving this two-way approach at an age still too young to understand the ways of the world is no easy task. Among his friends, he's the only one preparing for civil service. \\\"I have fears like 'what if this path doesn't work out,' 'what if I aim for both CSAT and civil service exam but end up with nothing.' It's lonely too.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, to Song Han-na (25, female), who is about to graduate from a top university in Seoul, Myeong's anxiety is close to whining. She has been preparing for the civil service exam since July last year. Before that, she hadn't really thought about the future. Her status as a university student was like a kind of 'anesthetic' to her. \\\"I spent four years with the vague thought that 'I'll do something,' and before I knew it, graduation was approaching,\\\" she expressed regret.\\n\\nAlthough she started preparing for civil service late, Song keenly feels the lack of time. This is because her parents' conditional permission to \\\"try until 2016, and if it doesn't work, get married\\\" binds her. For Song, who finds every minute and second precious, she often can't sleep due to regret, thinking \\\"What if I had started just two years earlier?\\\"\\n\\nSo what do gongding-origin civil servants currently working in the field think? Does the label of 'high school graduate' work against them? Are there no difficulties in starting social life early?\\n\\nIm Su-yeon (20, female, tax investigator), who started working at Dongdaemun Tax Office last year, explained, \\\"I get that question a lot, but it's not like that at all. Rather, there are many advantages because I'm young.\\\" In Im's case, the average age of her tax division colleagues is about 28. The oldest among them was born in 1962. There's a 34-year age gap between her and this person, who is old enough to be her father.\\n\\nIm is also distinctly young in the office. There's an 11-year gap between Im and her immediate senior. Given this situation, bosses old enough to be her father always take care of her like a daughter. Im smiled and said, \\\"I've often heard from seniors that the youngest really acts like the youngest.\\\"\\n\\nKim Ji-hye (pseudonym, female, 21), who has been working at a government agency in Sejong City for two years, thinks the difference in mindset can be a strength unique to high school graduate civil servants. She said, \\\"College graduates or Grade 7 civil servants tend to look down on miscellaneous work. But high school graduates came in relatively easily, so they seem to think they need to work harder.\\\"\\n\\nAmong college graduates, not few have complaints when they have to do work not directly related to department duties. Once, when doing work to identify department staff birthdays, a college graduate colleague complained, \\\"I don't want to do such trivial work.\\\" But Kim silently did whatever work was given without being picky. Praise from superiors continued, saying she \\\"takes initiative even with trivial tasks\\\" or \\\"has a sense of responsibility.\\\"\\n\\n**Current test-takers advantageous to 'settle the match' within next year**\\n\\nWhen asked if they regret not having university life and choosing civil service directly, both people agreed \\\"No.\\\" \\\"Senior civil servants say things like 'I should make my child a civil servant without sending them to university,' 'If I were reborn and became a civil servant again, I would challenge it right after high school graduation.' Every time I hear such praise, I think 'I'm glad I chose to come in early.'\\\"\\n\\nThe outlook is that Grade 9 civil service exams will continue to gain steady popularity among high school students and repeat test-takers in the future. However, there's no guarantee these good times will last forever. The lowered entry barrier is scheduled to be restored to its original state.\\n\\nAccording to the 'Grade 9 Civil Service Recruitment Exam Subject Revision Plan' released by the Ministry of Personnel Management on January 25 this year, from 2018, Grade 9 civil service exam subjects must include at least one 'specialized subject' related to the applied position's practical work. For example, tax positions must choose between tax law or accounting, and statistics positions must choose between statistics and economics. Regarding this, an official from KG Pass One's affiliated research institute, a civil service exam specialized academy in Noryangjin, Seoul, explained, \\\"This would essentially be the same as returning to before 2013, so the path to becoming a Grade 9 civil servant could become more difficult.\\\" To achieve the gongding dream, it might be more advantageous to settle the match within two years.\\n\\nKim Byeo-ri, intern reporter kimstar1215@hanmail.net / Photo by Kim Hyeon-dong kim.hd@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 8983, "output_tokens": 4181, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It means obeying one's father when young, submitting to one's husband after marriage, and following one's son after the husband's death. This concept appears in the Chinese Confucian classic 'Book of Rites' (Yeogi) and was part of the 'Three Bonds and Five Relations' (samgang-oryun), which served as fundamental ethics in our society for a long time. In 2016, South Korea saw the emergence of the term 'New Three Obediences,' which replaces women with men in the traditional concept. There's also another version emphasizing women's agency: women should follow both father's and mother's will when young, teach their husbands to create an equal household after marriage, and pursue their own path without being tied to their sons after their husbands die.\\n\\nChanging Gender Status Within the Household\\nSon, This Is How You Should Live... 'Matriarch' Leads Education, Economy, and Elderly Care\\n\\n\\\"Men should live modestly and just manage the household.\\\" \\\"How dare a man frown from morning?\\\" \\\"Don't interfere with women's work.\\\" \\\"When a man's voice crosses over the fence, the family faces ruin.\\\"\\n\\nWomen are now saying to men what men used to say to women. These are the words that comedian Kim Sook pours out to her virtual husband, comedian Yoon Jung-su, in JTBC's 'With You 2 - Greatest Love.' In another variety show, Kang Ju-eun treats Choi Min-su, once considered a symbol of machismo, like a child. These scenes are seen as reflecting the reality of traditional Korean patriarchal (gabujaeng) society transforming into a matriarchal (gamojaeng) society. Recently, the term 'New Three Obediences' has become popular, parodying the traditional female virtue of 'Three Obediences' from the Joseon Dynasty as a modern male virtue. We heard opinions about these changes from 30 men and women in their 30s to 60s.\\n\\nMothers' Information Networks, Fathers Can't Keep Up\\nMen's Position in Children's Education Diminishes\\n\\\"Rather Than Giving Unwanted Advice, Indifference Is Better\\\"\\n\\nWomen's role is most prominent in children's education. Ms. Kim (49, female, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who got her son admitted to a prestigious Seoul university this year, is a good example. With exceptional educational fervor, she not only followed admission briefings for her child's advancement but also knows university-specific admission information by heart. She attended over 10 admission briefings in the past year alone. When preparing for university early admission, she sought advice from renowned consultants and prepared necessary extracurricular activities for admission. It was her job to judge which schools and departments would favor her child's qualifications and devise strategies. While she consulted with her husband about target universities and departments, she mostly decided alone and pushed through with her decisions when opinions clashed. Ms. Kim said, \\\"When my child was a senior preparing for Advanced Placement or the Test of Economic Sense and Ability (TESAT), my husband opposed it saying 'it's not something students can handle,' but I thought 'he doesn't know what he's talking about' and ignored him. Thanks to information gained through mother networking and knowledge accumulated through legwork, I inevitably had the upper hand over my husband in children's education.\\\"\\n\\nIt's not just Ms. Kim. In most households, women take charge of children's education, whether they're working mothers or stay-at-home mothers. In fact, mothers taking charge of children's education has been an ongoing trend. What's changed is that husbands' authority in children's education has diminished more than before. Previously, even if husbands didn't directly handle children's education, they could voice their opinions, but now they've been pushed from the center. No wonder 'father's indifference' is considered one of the elements for successful college admission. Ms. Kim Eun-kyung (47, female, Umyeon-dong, Seocho-gu), who has a high school senior, said, \\\"I completely agree with that statement. I find it distasteful when my husband gives unwanted advice without knowing recent admission systems or educational trends.\\\" She finds it pathetic when he says things like 'no need to attend hagwons' or 'studying should be done alone' based only on his own student experience. She added, \\\"I don't know about other things, but when it comes to children's education, I think the best way my husband can help is to not interfere with women's work and just stay quiet.\\\"\\n\\nGiven this situation, men inevitably take a back seat in children's education. Mr. Lee (42, male, Segok-dong, Seocho-gu) is one such person. Since his father-in-law, who lives with them due to childcare needs, takes the lead in the child's education together with his wife, there's no need for him to step forward. He said, \\\"While they ask my opinion on major issues like elementary school selection or transfers, most things are discussed and decided by the two of them, so speaking up doesn't change much.\\\"\\n\\nDual-Income Households Increased 13.2% Over 20 Years\\nWomen Take Charge of Financial Management, Only Consulting on Large Amounts\\n\\\"My Salary Is Higher, So My Husband Defers to Me\\\"\\n\\nWomen's economic independence became the driving force for elevating women's status within households. The proportion of dual-income households, which was only 30.7% in 1994, increased by 13.2% to 43.9% in 2014.\\n\\nPreviously, when most families lived on husbands' income, it was natural for husbands to hold power in the household, but now with dual-income couples comprising nearly half, the structure inevitably makes men and women equal or elevates women. Ms. Choi (36, female, Jamsil-dong, Songpa-gu) said, \\\"When I was young, with dad as the sole breadwinner, mom always deferred to dad and accommodated everything from A to Z, but now my salary is higher than my younger husband's and I handle childcare too, so it seems natural that my husband defers to me and accommodates everything to me. Decision-making power and leadership within the household are inevitably related to economic power.\\\"\\n\\nCases where women manage household finances have also increased. Previously, working or business-running husbands would give wives a certain amount, but now husbands hand over their entire salaries to wives and receive allowances or use debit cards for living expenses.\\n\\nMs. Ko (32, female, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do), who has a dual income, is one such case. Her husband transfers his entire salary to Ms. Ko's account and uses a card under his own name. While the husband cannot know where Ms. Ko spends money, Ms. Ko can check anytime since it's her account. She said, \\\"This situation itself seems like evidence that economic leadership within households has shifted from men to women. We only discuss and decide together on things involving large amounts like home purchases or financial investments.\\\"\\n\\nIt's the same even for single-income households. Mr. Song (39, male, Ilsan, Gyeonggi-do), who works alone, has handed over his entire salary to his wife since getting married 10 years ago and receives 20,000 won [approximately $15 USD] daily allowance. Having seen his mother's superior financial management skills compared to his father's and watching her build wealth with a small salary, he developed the value that 'women should manage money.' He said, \\\"Honestly, women manage money better than men because they're more meticulous and detailed. About 70-80% of my friends also entrust household management to their wives.\\\"\\n\\nRecently, an atmosphere of managing households independently has spread. Even dual-income couples don't entrust everything to either men or women but create joint accounts and contribute certain amounts for living expenses. Statistics Korea's 2015 Family Status Survey illustrates this well. When asked about family decision-making, 'couples decide together' responses were 36.8% for children's education, but 57.5% for home purchases and 43.6% for investment/property management. Rather than leaning toward either men or women, many couples manage households from equal positions. Ms. Lee (33, female, Garak-dong, Songpa), an office worker in her second year of marriage, said, \\\"Unlike my sister who is three years older and manages all money while having dual incomes, my husband and I manage jointly. Initially, my husband wanted me to do everything because it was 'bothersome,' but at some point he wanted to have economic power too, and I agreed because managing alone often became overwhelming.\\\"\\n\\nGender Distinctions in Parent Care Disappeared Long Ago\\n38.5% of Men Willing to Live with In-Laws\\n\\\"Marriage Makes One an Outsider - Now It's Men, Not Women\\\"\\n\\nWomen's role in parent care has also increased. Daughters' voices have begun to grow stronger, making the saying 'chulgaoein' (a married daughter is no different from a stranger) meaningless. Ms. Kim Hye-ra (52, female, Mok-dong, Yangcheon-gu), who has college-age children, said, \\\"Among mothers these days, there's a joke that sons are useless once they marry, expressed as 'sons are too distant to be close' and 'sons are daughters-in-law's husbands.' The term 'chulgaoein' now applies to men, not women.\\\"\\n\\nWhile it was natural for sons to support parents previously, things have changed. An atmosphere has strengthened where capable people support parents regardless of gender, and the parent generation has also become less inclined to depend on their children. Ms. Seo (63, female, Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu) said, \\\"Unless there's a special purpose like caring for grandchildren or saving money, I don't want to live with either sons or daughters. If capable, I want to live separately and go to a nursing home or silver town when older.\\\"\\n\\nWith working daughters, more mothers-in-law caring for grandchildren has led to increased young couples living with in-laws. Mr. Lee (42, male, Segok-dong, Gangnam-gu) said, \\\"It's been six years since we combined households with my parents-in-law due to childcare. My father-in-law takes the lead in children's education, and my mother-in-law handles all household chores, making it convenient in many ways.\\\" The proverb 'would one live with in-laws if they had three mal [approximately 54 liters] of barley?' has become outdated.\\n\\nMen's perception of living with in-laws has also changed. According to a 2014 survey by job portal Saramin of 1,362 unmarried office workers about parent care, 38.5% of men answered they were 'willing to live with in-laws,' but only 19.1% of women said they would 'live with in-laws' - about half the rate. Ms. Ko (32, female, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do) said, \\\"As an only daughter, I planned to live with my mother before marriage, and my husband agreed. Men don't feel much resistance because relationships with fathers-in-law are more horizontal than mother-in-law relationships.\\\"\\n\\nBeing relatively psychologically closer than sons also makes parents depend on daughters. Women are more relationship-oriented and superior in empathy and communication abilities. Ms. Kwon (63, female, Garak-dong, Songpa-gu), who raised and married off three children (one son, two daughters), said, \\\"When they were young, I favored sons so much that I only made daughters do household chores, thinking 'sons are the best,' but after raising them all, I found that daughters are the ones who care for parents attentively. While my son contacts us only occasionally when something comes up after marriage, I exchange KakaoTalk messages with my two daughters several times daily.\\\"\\n\\nThe weakening of son preference reflects the same context. The saying that having two daughters is a 'gold medal' while having two sons is a 'wooden medal' was unimaginable until 30-40 years ago. Ms. Kim (43, female, Seonghyeon-dong, Gwanak-gu), who has a high school senior son, said, \\\"Born as the second daughter after my sister, my father wouldn't even look at me as a newborn due to severe 'namjonyeobi' (male superiority, female inferiority). Watching my sister now getting along with her daughter like friends makes me regret not having another daughter.\\\" Ms. Kim Hye-ra said, \\\"Previously, visiting one's natal family after marriage required watching my husband's or in-laws' reactions, but the situation has changed. Now husbands often defer to wives when caring for their parents.\\\"\\n\\nMatriarchy - The Struggling Superwoman\\nIncreased Roles at Home, Trapped by Glass Ceiling in Society\\n\\nWhen did women's voices begin to grow in households? Experts unanimously say, \\\"The change toward a matriarchal society parallels societal changes.\\\" When economic development plans began in the 1960s and industry was booming, society's central value was 'work' rather than 'family,' but as society developed, more people began prioritizing 'family.' As women's social participation became active, the binary structure where men work and women only manage households also broke down.\\n\\nWatching Kim Sook on TV Provides Catharsis for Patriarchy's Dissolution\\nOECD's #1 in Women's Employment Discrimination and Glass Ceiling\\nNot Actually Female Superiority... Misogyny Like 'Mom-Worm' Also Exists\\n\\nThis movement started first in developed countries. American female journalist Hanna Rosin said in her book 'The End of Men,' \\\"Men have dominated the world for 40,000 years, and women began pushing men aside 40 years ago.\\\" She argued in the book that starting from 2009, for the first time in American history, the labor force balance tipped from men to women, entering an era of female superiority.\\n\\nShe cited the transition to a post-industrial society centered on knowledge and services as the reason. While women with weaker physiques lost dominance to men in the past, entering modern times where social intelligence and communication abilities are important created a world where physical strength doesn't determine dominance. Lee Su-yeon, director of the Korean Working Mom Research Institute, said, \\\"In situations where intergenerational communication is important, women with superior empathy abilities inevitably gain higher status. The aging and low birth rate era also empowered women.\\\"\\n\\nOpinions are divided on whether these changes are positive for women. Critics point out that the collapse of gender role boundaries within households shouldn't appear as if women's status has risen. There are also concerns about media exaggerating matriarchy. Ahn Sang-su, director of the Equal Society Research Center at the Korean Women's Policy Research Institute, said, \\\"While women and men should have equal rights, it's dangerous to make our society appear like a female-dominated society. This could make women who still live unequally throughout society suffer more.\\\" The claim that our society has 'entered a matriarchal society' is itself a hasty generalization error.\\n\\nThe term 'matriarch' itself contains negative nuances. This is why the term 'matriarch' is called a mirroring effect of patriarch (a method of making the other party realize their mistakes by imitating their words and actions). Ms. Park (37, female, Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam) said, \\\"Just as the word 'patriarch' connects with 'authoritarian,' the word 'matriarch' contains the meaning of 'women dominating men.' Women feeling catharsis watching Kim Sook or Kang Ju-eun's behavior is evidence that our society hasn't escaped the patriarchal era yet.\\\"\\n\\nIncreased male misogyny toward women reflects the same context. Some men who can't assert themselves with women at home or in society have begun leading in disparaging women. Ms. Baek (33, female, Sincheon-dong, Songpa-gu) said, \\\"The foundation of men vilifying women as 'kimchi girls,' 'doenjang girls,' or 'mom-worms' has deeply rooted patriarchal ideology that 'women should be modest and obedient to men's words.' Men's anger toward the recently controversial anti-misogyny site 'Megalia' is also connected to this.\\\"\\n\\nCritics also point out that matriarchal society assigns excessive roles to women. Previously, women only needed to raise children with money their husbands earned, but now they must work at companies while handling children's education, leading household economics, and supporting parents - literally becoming 'superwomen.' Ms. Gu (33, Jingan-dong, Eunpyeong-gu), married for 10 years, said, \\\"My mother-in-law says 'women should also work' while expecting me to fulfill the roles she had as a full-time housewife. Matriarchal society is definitely not good for women.\\\" Ms. Kim (36, Jamwon-dong, Seocho) said, \\\"When I come home even slightly late due to heavy work, I feel like a criminal. Sometimes I envy my mother who only worried about household chores as a full-time housewife.\\\"\\n\\nPersistent severe gender discrimination in society is also problematic. Korea is considered the country with the most severe discrimination against female workers among OECD member countries. It has consistently ranked first since the OECD began compiling related statistics in 2002. The glass ceiling index also remains low. In the 2016 glass ceiling index published by British weekly The Economist, Korea scored 25 points, ranking last among 29 major OECD countries. The glass ceiling index is calculated by combining higher education, gender wage gaps, corporate executive ratios, and female parliamentarian ratios - higher scores indicate better gender equality in society. Being a superwoman at home while breaking invisible barriers in society is the burden women living today must carry.\\n\\n[Cover Story] ▶6 PM Quitting Time Established...

Among the young women in their 20s and 30s, several men could also be spotted. Recently in Japan, more men have been giving chocolate to women on Valentine's Day. Most are young men buying chocolate to give to women they've had feelings for, but one middle-aged man's presence seemed out of place. Here's the explanation from Watanabe (43, office worker), who spent a total of 20,000 yen [approximately $150 USD] to buy 20 chocolates.\\n\\n\\\"I bought these to give to female employees in our department and others I know in the company. Since I'm in a position where I often nag or give warnings to subordinates, giving chocolate on Valentine's Day like this helps improve my likability in the workplace.\\\"\\n\\nWatanabe, who spent half of his monthly allowance of around 40,000 yen [approximately $300 USD] on chocolate, is prepared to make do with his wife's packed lunches for the month of February. Working as a section chief at a mid-sized company, he has a son and daughter in elementary and middle school. Combined with his wife's income from part-time work at a nearby supermarket, the Watanabe household earns about 500,000 yen [approximately $3,750 USD] monthly. While they need to minimize expenses to pay for the children's hagwon fees and housing loans, Valentine's Day chocolate is Watanabe's own strategy for workplace survival. As a middle manager caught between superiors and subordinates, he says that whenever he scolds subordinates even slightly harshly, he inevitably receives complaints about 'power harassment' (using authority for abuse) or 'moral harassment' (psychological abuse through words or attitude).\\n\\nJapan's middle-aged men in their 40s and 50s are caught in a harsh crisis as middle managers who must be prepared to resign voluntarily if they fail to produce results at work. Even if they avoid resignation, many are pushed into marginal positions after turning 50. The 2013 TBS drama <Hanzawa Naoki> was a sensational drama with a final episode viewership rating exceeding 42%, featuring the exhilarating story of Hanzawa (45), a loan manager at a major bank, fighting against various workplace injustices and corruption. However, the drama ended with Hanzawa unexpectedly receiving a transfer order to a subsidiary after handling the injustices and saving the bank from crisis. 'Shukko' (transfer) refers to orders for head office employees to move to subsidiaries or affiliated companies, known among Japanese salarymen as a 'one-way ticket' issued to employees around age 50, meaning 'demotion' with no return to the head office.\\n\\nMiddle-aged men face increasingly narrow positions not only at work but also at home. Children grow distant from their fathers as they pass through adolescence, and relationships with wives aren't what they used to be. They must care for retired parents while children's education costs become increasingly burdensome. According to a survey by Japan's National Tax Agency (equivalent to Korea's National Tax Service), the average annual income for male workers in their 40s was 6 million yen [approximately $45,000 USD] in 2015, and 6.4 million yen [approximately $48,000 USD] for those in their 50s, significantly higher than those in their 20s (2.7 million yen [approximately $20,000 USD]) and 30s (4.5 million yen [approximately $34,000 USD]). However, middle-aged men's monthly allowances were lower than those of men in their 20s-30s: 36,719 yen [approximately $275 USD] for those in their 40s and 37,996 yen [approximately $285 USD] for those in their 50s. Due to tight finances from covering children's education costs, housing loans, and parent support expenses, they lack the economic freedom to properly enjoy even one hobby. They have less than 560 yen [approximately $4.20 USD] available for a single lunch, and their stress-relief drinking sessions, which occur about 2.5 times per month, cost around 5,000 yen [approximately $37.50 USD] each—not enough to even treat subordinates. <These statistics are from Shinsei Bank's '2015 Office Worker Allowance Survey'>\\n\\n'New Human' and 'Dankai Junior' generations who enjoyed popular culture\\n\\nMiddle-aged men also face physical crises. Men around age 45, like women, reportedly show physical and mental menopausal symptoms. In their 40s, testosterone production decreases to half that of their 20s, causing significant aging of skeleton, muscles, and skin, with physical strength dropping to 80% of their 20s levels, experiencing hair loss and rapidly declining sexual function. Increased fatty acid secretion in the body strengthens the distinctive male body odor, causing discomfort in interpersonal relationships. They also become mentally unstable, suffering from depression, anxiety, insomnia, obsessions, and headaches.\\n\\nThe generations currently constituting Japan's middle-aged are defined in marketing as the 'New Human' generation (born 1960-1970) and the 'Dankai Junior' generation (born 1971-1974). The New Human generation, meaning a new generation with completely different norms, values, and sensibilities from existing generations, had TVs in their homes from birth and grew up enjoying popular culture such as animation, rock music, and techno-pop, representing the generation when otaku culture flourished.\\n\\nThe Dankai Junior generation, children of the first baby boom Dankai generation, had dedicated TVs and phones in their own rooms and, under dual-income parents, spent more time in personal space and alone rather than in family-oriented living, making them notably individualistic. The bubble economy era (1986-1991) that both generations commonly experienced in their youth was Japan's most prosperous period. Overseas travel to Europe became common among ordinary people from their school days, luxury brands became widely popular, and it was an era when men began paying significant attention to fashion. It was also the generation when male consumption culture for women flourished, including 'keep-kun' (referring to men who, separate from boyfriends, buy meals, provide car rides, or give spending money to women).\\n\\nHagiyama (50, pseudonym), who runs a wine bar in Fukuoka, is a divorced single man currently living with his girlfriend Ryoko, who is 19 years younger. The two first met as customer and owner, naturally growing closer as Hagiyama counseled Ryoko through her troubles. Hagiyama, who had been silently listening to Ryoko's concerns about workplace conflicts while she sat at the counter, gave her his phone number saying \\\"call anytime when things are tough,\\\" and the two later developed into lovers. \\\"When I first shared my troubles, he listened to my story for an entire hour without saying anything. I think I was attracted to the embracing capacity and consideration I couldn't feel from men of my generation. We've been living together for two years, but he still listens attentively and accepts all my complaints, making me feel secure.\\\" This is how Ryoko explained the appeal of middle-aged men like Hagiyama.\\n\\nMegumi (22), who works at an IT company in Tokyo, is in an office romance with her 45-year-old supervisor Kobayashi (pseudonym). The relationship began last fall when Kobayashi helped Megumi out of a crisis caused by a work mistake. \\\"When I got into big trouble by mixing up emails to different clients, he cleaned up the mess for me. As a new employee, I only wanted to die after realizing my mistake, but he personally visited the clients to apologize and resolved everything swiftly. When I texted him late at night apologizing out of guilt, he took a taxi to where I was and consoled me caringly, saying he was worried. Even now, watching him follow up on subordinates' mistakes one by one at work, he seems capable of doing anything, which makes me both respect and feel excited about him.\\\"\\n\\nMatching parties for men in their 40s and women in their 20s emerge\\n\\n'Ure-dan' (mature men), referring to sophisticated middle-aged men like Hagiyama and Kobayashi, is currently popular among Japanese women. Ure-dan is a neologism created in 2012 by a fashion magazine for middle-aged men. According to the magazine, ure-dan \\\"doesn't simply mean men who have aged. It's a term expressing respect for mature men who continue their activities after being tempered by life's storms, accumulating various experiences, and overcoming life's bitterness.\\\" Along with this ure-dan boom, trending terms like 'bai-ijou' (men twice one's age or older) and 'kare-sen' (uncle specialists) emerged among young women. As middle-aged men's popularity rose among young women, specialized ure-dan dating sites appeared on the internet, and marriage agencies began regularly holding matching parties for men in their 40s and women in their 20s. Various internet novels and manga featuring men around 40 as protagonists have appeared consecutively, and dramas featuring ure-dan have emerged. <Please Let Me Call You Father-in-law!>, about a 51-year-old man dating a 23-year-old woman and struggling to get marriage permission from his same-aged father-in-law, is a popular drama that has been broadcasting on Fuji TV since January this year.\\n\\nWhat attracts young women to middle-aged men? <Campus Magazine>, a site mainly used by university students, selected five appeals of ure-dan chosen by female college students: ①They provide psychological comfort by accepting all forms of acting spoiled ②You can meet them comfortably without having to exaggerate or dress up yourself, and they overlook minor mistakes ③Being economically stable, there's no burden about costs when dating ④There are almost no mama's boys because their bonds with parents aren't strong ⑤They're reliable as experienced life seniors. These were analyzed as appeals unique to middle-aged men that young men lack.\\n\\nIn a December 2014 'Appeal of Men Over 40' report by Trend Soken (トレンド 總硏), which specializes in lifestyle surveys, 38% of 3,000 female office workers in their 20s answered that they had been attracted to men over 40. The most common response at 49% was that the man was a supervisor or senior at the same workplace. Reasons for feeling attracted included 'adult-like composure, rich experience, economic freedom, sexiness, smartness, manliness.' Meanwhile, points that men over 40 should work on to appear attractive included 'cleanliness, dignity, manliness, sophistication.'\\n\\nStylist Yoshigawa Kotaro emphasizes age-appropriate clothing as a fashion tip for ordinary middle-aged men to transform into attractive ure-dan. \\\"In fashion too, it's important to portray a mature adult with embracing capacity appropriate for one's age. Avoid fashion that looks too young or, conversely, too old. For best items, I recommend matching a jacket with casual cotton-based pants and casual shoes rather than sneakers. The point is to give a moderately active impression. What to be careful about is size. In their 40s, as bellies protrude and weight increases, people prefer loose sizes, but such clothing makes you look older. However, clothing that fits too tightly like young people's doesn't suit middle-aged body types. When buying clothes, you should try on multiple sizes and choose clothing that fits your body type.\\\"\\n\\nRomance consultant Sakurai Yui emphasizes that the point middle-aged men should be careful about to win young women's hearts is 'cleanliness.' \\\"Maintaining a clean appearance is necessary. For example, beard marks or nose hair can look unclean, so they must be neatly handled. Skin care shouldn't be neglected either. When looking oily, use men's deodorant sheets; when looking dry, moisturize the skin. To reduce body odor, make small efforts like exercising to improve sweat gland function and checking for periodontal disease or internal organ health conditions that cause bad breath—these connect to capturing young women's hearts.\\\"\\n\\nPsychological counselor Kuroiwa Hiroyuki analyzes the ure-dan boom: \\\"Women's preference for older men has existed since long ago. However, while the age range used to be at most 5-10 years, now the range has expanded because more men over 40 remain energetic and physically attractive. In today's age of living to 100, it means that men with embracing capacity, appealing appearance, and psychological and economic freedom are popular regardless of age.\\\"\\n\\nKorea's 'Flower Middle-aged Men'\\nEscaping the 'dog-uncle' image to be reborn with sophisticated charm\\n\\nSeong A-reum (23, pseudonym) is an English literature student at a prestigious university who deferred graduation by one year for job hunting—a so-called job preparation student. She received a full-time employee offer from a company where she worked as an intern, but she's lukewarm about it. The workplace is a company operating a complex shopping mall, and while the work itself is interesting, she's hesitant about joining due to the workplace atmosphere. \\\"My mom asks what I'm being picky about in these difficult times, but I'm hesitating because of the team leader (direct supervisor). On the first day at a company dinner, he gave the interns a big lecture, and even now he grabs us whenever he gets a chance to give advice. It's about job hunting and workplace life, but when you listen, it's not practically helpful and it's all self-bragging. He's usually quite strict with female employees, frequently pointing out female employees' clothing and always asking female employees to pour drinks at company dinners. He also gives me hints about things like coffee errands, saying the youngest should do them... He's very authoritarian, so I'm hesitant about working under him.\\\"\\n\\nAmid increasingly strict views on the authoritarian and careless behavior of middle-aged men who form the backbone of our society, a newspaper article recently introduced such behavior under the shocking title 'dog-uncle' (dog + uncle), drawing attention. \\\"Coffee tastes best when made by women. If women or restaurant staff look younger than me, I always speak informally to them. Even when my thoughts are wrong, I first defend them out of pride. I frequently stare at specific parts of women's bodies on public transportation. I've loudly chatted in public places while drunk. I think I could date a woman much younger than me if I put my mind to it. I often use the phrase 'Back in our day...'\\\"\\n\\nThe newspaper listed characteristics of 'dog-uncles' and, based on survey results, defined dog-uncles as \\\"men in their early 40s to 60s who are excessively authoritarian, commit fouls for their own benefit, are strong toward women and the socially weak but weak toward the powerful.\\\"\\n\\nMiddle-aged protagonist dramas and variety shows gain popularity... 'Gold Papa' and 'Grooming tribe' increase\\n\\nProfessor Kim Heon-sik of Dong-ah Institute of Media and Arts explains the dog-uncle controversy as follows: \\\"Dog-uncle is a neologism created by the cultural gap between the middle-aged generation trying to generalize their success experiences and values, and the younger generation that values self-fulfillment above all and avoids interference. When socially established middle-aged men push their thoughts or experiences unilaterally and forcefully, the younger generation perceives this as authoritarian and domineering behavior, but since they're in positions as subordinates or juniors socially, they cannot directly rebel. As a complaint about this, the younger generation attaches the prefix 'dog' that they like to use on the internet to disparage uncle characters they dislike.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Kim recommends 'dad jokes' to middle-aged men sensitive about being called dog-uncles. 'Dad jokes' are lame gags recently popularized by star chef Oh Se-deuk (40) through a broadcast program. \\\"Yang-nyeom (seasoning) using both hands (yang-son)\\\", \\\"During lobster (dae-ha) season, we watch lobster (dae-ha) dramas\\\" - these are word plays not much different from existing uncle jokes, but unlike uncle jokes, they don't force laughter, so you don't have to laugh forcibly, and it doesn't matter if someone openly criticizes them as unfunny. Professor Kim adds: \\\"Dad jokes are anti-authoritarian gag codes that leave the choice of reaction open in horizontal and equal relationships with others. I'd like to recommend that middle-aged men learn communication through consideration and embracing—advantages of the currently popular 'dad jokes.'\\\"\\n\\nOn another side of society, middle-aged men are rapidly emerging as the center of consumption and cultural trends. Since <A Gentleman's Dignity>, middle-aged romance has been popular in dramas, while various variety programs like <Three Meals a Day> and <The Return of Superman> have featured middle-aged men as main characters. Last year, a cable channel targeting middle-aged men in their 30s-50s opened, drawing attention. Channel O tvN, newly launched by CJ E&M in September last year, aims for programs that the middle-aged demographic, establishing itself as a new cultural consumption entity, can comfortably enjoy. Lee Deuk-jae, CJ E&M Broadcasting Content Division CEO, emphasized: \\\"Today's 40-50 year-olds are much younger than their actual age. We'll introduce content these people can enjoy with young minds—content that can provide pleasure and fun in humanistic, psychological, and philosophical aspects,\\\" adding \\\"The era when viewer ratings were the issue has passed. Now is an era when buzz is important.\\\"\\n\\nFollowing the broadcasting industry, the gaming market trend is also quickly shifting to target middle-aged men. Sophisticated middle-aged actors who dominate Korean cinema—Cha Seung-won (born 1970), Lee Byung-hun (born 1970), Jang Dong-gun (born 1972), Jung Woo-sung (born 1973), Lee Jung-jae (born 1973)—have recently been hired en masse as game advertisement models. This follows the trend of mobile games' main consumer demographic, once considered exclusive to teens and 20-somethings, moving to the 30-40 age group, with companies employing top actors familiar to them as part of strategies targeting middle-aged consumers as their main demographic. The middle-aged demographic's ticket power has long been proven in the film industry, and in the publishing market, the main readership has been moving to middle-aged people over 40 since 2014.\\n\\nAccording to 2015 Statistics Korea data, the generations occupying the largest proportion of Korea's population structure are those in their 40s (17.2%) and 50s (16.2%). As the middle-aged demographic emerged as a power consumption group, the marketing industry is busy with marketing to entice middle-aged consumption. Particularly, various neologisms for middle-aged men, who had been neglected in the consumer market, have emerged in large numbers.\\n\\nThere's also the term Goldpapa tribe. This neologism refers to middle-aged men who enjoy economic freedom and possess fashion sense comparable to young people, rejecting authoritarian images and work-centered lifestyles while investing time and money in fashion and beauty, emphasizing and enthusiastically enjoying their preferences, hobbies, and lifestyles including cars and sports.\\n\\nGrooming tribe refers to men who invest generously in fashion and beauty. They spare no effort for skin, hair, dental care, and even plastic surgery to make themselves stand out. NoMU tribe means 'No More Uncle,' referring to middle-aged men in their 40s-50s who firmly refuse to be called uncles. They're interested not only in external youth but also internal youth, possessing free thoughts and values and maintaining attitudes of communicating freely with younger generations.\\n\\nAnti-aging skin care is basic... They spare no investment in appearance\\n\\nHAHA tribe means 'Happy Aging Healthy & Attractive,' referring to middle-aged people living happily through self-development. They're characterized by consuming for themselves, generously investing time and money in cultural life and health management.\\n\\nLee Hyeong-gi (52, pseudonym), who runs a business, is a representative flower middle-aged man. He exercises daily under a personal trainer's guidance and receives skin care once a week. For anti-aging, he receives 'Thermage' skin lifting treatment once annually and has had laser treatments to remove spots and blemishes and surgery to remove under-eye fat. Every morning before going to work, he carefully applies BB cream before leaving home. For clothing, he wears scarves instead of ties to avoid a stiff impression and prefers colored shoes in brown or navy rather than black.\\n\\n\\\"I spend about 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] monthly on appearance. Since I run a business, I meet people frequently and need to pay attention to appearance. Thanks to this, people often tell me I 'look young' and have a 'baby face.' It seems like they're recognizing my value, which makes me secretly proud. I think flower middle-aged ultimately means people who have the leisure to invest time and money in appearance.\\\"\\n\\nKim Seong-cheol (47), who works at a foreign company, whose hobbies used to be drinking and 'becoming a mermaid' on holidays (lying on his side with legs crossed, watching TV without moving), is currently struggling to be reborn as a flower middle-aged man. This is because of his eldest son Dong-jun (8), who recently entered elementary school. \\\"I married late, so my children are still young compared to my peers. When I went to my son's kindergarten for a class observation, I heard that his friends teased him saying his dad was old, and I thought this wouldn't do.\\\" Kim reduces drinking and exercises at least three times a week. He bought expensive shampoo and toner to prevent hair loss and visits a beauty salon once a month for coloring and scalp massage. He purchased men's cosmetics for skin care and even received Botox treatment for Dong-jun's elementary school entrance ceremony. \\\"I started this to boost my child's spirits, but now I'm satisfied with my appearance. Since I thought I was still young, I was lazy about health and appearance, but from now on I want to be faithful to life for inner self as well as appearance.\\\"\\n\\nMiddle age is a generation 'sandwiched' between youth and elderly generations, a confusing period of being neither young nor old. Also called the second adolescence or 'sa-chu-gi' (thinking of autumn period), it's a psychologically unstable period with many conflicts, along with adolescence.\\n\\nJung (Carl Gustav), the Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology, defined middle age as 'life's noon' dividing life's first and second halves, noting that 'people experience important life turning points in middle age, causing serious inner changes'—focusing on the crisis of middle age. However, he viewed the middle-aged crisis as a kind of self-healing process, emphasizing it as a healthy change appearing in mature people.\\n\\nMiddle-aged men who have invested time and money for their families rather than themselves often don't know what they want to do or how they can be happy. While there's no need to necessarily follow the trend of flower middle-aged men created by consumer society, if they start by listening to their inner desires, they can find happiness regardless of age.\\n\\n- Kim Kyeong-cheol, Seoul correspondent for Kodansha [a major Japanese publisher] news magazine division\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 12530, "output_tokens": 5587, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Among the young women in their 20s and 30s, scattered middle-aged men also caught the eye. Recently in Japan, more men have been giving chocolates to women on Valentine's Day. Most are young men purchasing chocolates for women they've had feelings for, but one middle-aged man stood out as not fitting the atmosphere. Watanabe (43, office worker), who spent a total of 20,000 yen [approximately $150 USD] to buy 20 chocolates, explained:\\n\\n\\\"I bought these for the female employees I know in our department and throughout the company. Since I'm in a position where I often nag or warn my subordinates, giving chocolates on Valentine's Day like this helps improve my likability in the workplace.\\\"\\n\\nWatanabe, who spent half of his monthly allowance of about 40,000 yen [approximately $300 USD] on chocolate, is prepared to eat his wife's packed lunches for the entire month of February. Working as a section manager at a mid-sized company, he has two children in elementary and middle school. Combined with his wife's income from part-time work at a nearby supermarket, the Watanabe household earns about 500,000 yen [approximately $3,750 USD] per month. To pay for the children's hagwon fees and housing loans, they must minimize expenses as much as possible, but Valentine's Day chocolate is Watanabe's way of navigating workplace life. As a middle manager caught between superiors and subordinates, whenever he scolds his subordinates even slightly, he often receives complaints about 'power harassment' or 'moral harassment.'\\n\\nJapan's middle-aged men in their 40s and 50s are caught in a cold wind of crisis as middle managers who must be prepared to voluntarily resign if they fail to produce results at work. Even if they avoid resignation, many are pushed to marginal positions after turning 50. The 2013 TBS drama <Hanzawa Naoki> was a hit drama with a final episode viewership rating exceeding 42%, featuring the exhilarating story of Hanzawa (45), a loan officer and section manager at a major bank, fighting against various injustices and corruption within the company. However, the drama ends with Hanzawa unexpectedly receiving orders to transfer to a subsidiary after handling the irregularities and saving the bank from crisis. 'Shukko' (出向) refers to main company employees being ordered to move to subsidiaries or affiliated companies, and among Japan's salarymen, it's called a 'one-way ticket' issued to workers around age 50, meaning a 'demotion' with no return to the main company.\\n\\nMiddle-aged men find their position narrowing not only at work but also at home. Children grow distant from their fathers after adolescence, and relationships with wives are not what they used to be. They must care for retired parents while children's education costs become increasingly burdensome. According to a survey by Japan's National Tax Agency (equivalent to our National Tax Service), the average annual income for male workers in their 40s in 2015 was 6 million yen [approximately $45,000 USD], and for those in their 50s, 6.4 million yen [approximately $48,000 USD], significantly higher than those in their 20s (2.7 million yen [approximately $20,250 USD]) and 30s (4.5 million yen [approximately $33,750 USD]). However, middle-aged men's monthly allowances were lower than those of men in their 20s-30s: 36,719 yen [approximately $275 USD] for men in their 40s and 37,996 yen [approximately $285 USD] for men in their 50s. Due to tight finances from supporting children's education costs, housing loans, and parent care expenses, they lack economic leisure to properly enjoy even one hobby. They can spend less than 560 yen [approximately $4.20 USD] for one lunch, and their drinking sessions for stress relief about 2.5 times per month cost around 5,000 yen [approximately $37.50 USD] per session—not even enough to treat their subordinates. <These statistics are from Shinsei Bank's '2015 Office Workers' Allowance Survey'>\\n\\n'New Human' and 'Dankai Junior' Generations Who Enjoyed Popular Culture\\n\\nMiddle-aged men also face physical crises. Men around age 45 show physical and mental menopausal symptoms similar to women. In their 40s, production of the male hormone testosterone decreases to half of what it was in their 20s, causing significant aging of skeleton, muscles, and skin, with physical strength dropping to 80% of their 20s levels, experiencing hair loss and rapidly declining sexual vigor. Increased fatty acid secretion in the body strengthens the distinctive male body odor, causing discomfort in interpersonal relationships. They also become mentally unstable, suffering from depression, anxiety, insomnia, obsessive thoughts, and headaches.\\n\\nThe generation currently constituting Japan's middle-aged is defined in marketing as the 'New Human' generation (born 1960-1970) and the 'Dankai Junior' generation (born 1971-1974).

The bubble economy era (1986-1991) that both generations commonly experienced in their youth was Japan's most prosperous period. Among ordinary people, overseas travel to Europe and other places became common from school days, luxury brands became widely popular, and men began paying significant attention to fashion.

As middle-aged men's popularity rose among young women, specialized Ure-dan dating sites appeared on the internet, and marriage information companies regularly hold matchmaking parties for men in their 40s and women in their 20s. Various internet novels and comics featuring men around 40 as protagonists continue to appear, and dramas featuring Ure-dan have emerged. <Please Let Me Call You Father-in-Law!>, about a 51-year-old man dating a 23-year-old woman while struggling to get marriage permission from his same-age father-in-law, is a popular drama that has been airing on Fuji TV since January this year.\\n\\nWhy are young women attracted to middle-aged men? <Campus Magazine>, a site mainly used by university students, selected five appeals of Ure-dan chosen by female college students: ①They accept all forms of acting spoiled, providing psychological comfort ②You don't need to exaggerate or dress up yourself, and they overlook minor mistakes, making meetings comfortable ③They're economically stable, removing cost burdens during dates ④They have weak parental bonds, so there are almost no mama's boys ⑤They're experienced life seniors who can be relied upon.

When socially established middle-aged men unilaterally and forcefully push their thoughts or experiences, the young generation receives this as authoritarian and domineering attitudes, but because they are in positions as subordinates or juniors socially, they cannot directly rebel. As dissatisfaction with this, the young generation uses the prefix 'gae' they enjoy using on the internet to disparage uncle characters they dislike.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Kim recommends 'ajae gag' to middle-aged men sensitive to the term gae-jeo-ssi. 'Ajae gag' refers to lame jokes recently popularized by star chef Oh Se-deuk (40) through a broadcast program. \\\"Both hands for seasoning (yangseon-euro haeseo yangnyeom),\\\" \\\"During prawn season, turn on prawn dramas (daeha-cheol-e-neun daeha-deurama-reul teunda)\\\" - while these are language plays not much different from existing uncle jokes, they don't force laughter like uncle jokes, so you don't have to laugh forcedly and it doesn't matter if you're told to your face that it's not funny. Professor Kim adds, \\\"Ajae gag is an anti-authoritarian comedy code that leaves the choice of reaction open in horizontal and equal relationships with others. I want to recommend that middle-aged men learn communication through consideration and tolerance, which are the advantages of the currently popular 'ajae gag.'\\\"\\n\\nOn the other side of society, middle-aged men are rapidly emerging as the center of consumption and cultural trends. Middle-aged romance has been popular in dramas since <A Gentleman's Dignity>, and middle-aged men have appeared as main characters in various variety programs like <Three Meals a Day> and <The Return of Superman>. Last year, a cable channel targeting middle-aged men in their 30s-50s opened and attracted attention. O tvN, newly introduced by CJ E&M in September last year, aims for programs that the middle-aged, who are establishing themselves as new cultural consumption subjects, can comfortably enjoy. Lee Deuk-jae, CJ E&M's broadcast content division representative, emphasized, \\\"Today's 40-50 year olds are much younger than their actual age. We will introduce content these people can enjoy with a young mindset, content that can provide pleasure and fun in humanities, psychological, and philosophical aspects,\\\" adding \\\"The era when viewership ratings were the issue has passed. Now is an era when buzz is important.\\\"\\n\\nFollowing the broadcasting industry, gaming market trends are also quickly shifting to target middle-aged men. Mature, charismatic middle-aged actors who dominate Korean cinema like Cha Seung-won (born 1970), Lee Byung-hun (born 1970), Jang Dong-gun (born 1972), Jung Woo-sung (born 1973), and Lee Jung-jae (born 1973) are being recruited en masse as game advertisement models recently. As the main consumer base of mobile games, previously considered the exclusive domain of teens and 20-somethings, shifts to the 30-40 age group, companies are deploying strategies targeting middle-aged people as their main target by recruiting top actors familiar to them. The ticket power of middle-aged people has long been proven in the film industry, and in the publishing market, the main readership has been moving to middle-aged people over 40 since 2014.\\n\\nAccording to 2015 Statistics Korea, the generations occupying the largest proportion in our country's population structure are those in their 40s (17.2%) and 50s (16.2%). As the middle-aged emerged as a power consumption group, marketing targeting middle-aged consumption is in full swing in the marketing industry. Particularly, various new terms for middle-aged men who had been neglected in the consumer market have appeared in large numbers.\\n\\nThere's also the term 'Goldpapa tribe.' This is a new term referring to middle-aged men who enjoy economic leisure and have fashion sense comparable to young people. They reject authoritarian images and work-centered lifestyles, invest time and money in fashion and beauty, and are enthusiastic about enjoying automobiles, sports, and other personal preferences, hobbies, and lifestyles.\\n\\n'Grooming tribe' refers to men who invest generously in fashion and beauty. They don't hesitate to undergo even plastic surgery, as well as skin, hair, and dental care, to make themselves stand out. 'NoMU tribe' means 'No More Uncle,' referring to middle-aged men in their 40s-50s who firmly refuse to be called 'uncle.' They're interested not only in external youth but also internal youth, having free thinking and values and an attitude of communicating freely with younger generations.\\n\\nAnti-aging Skin Care is Basic... Don't Spare Investment in Appearance\\n\\n'HAHA tribe' means 'Happy Aging Healthy & Attractive,' referring to middle-aged people who live happily through self-development. They're characterized by consuming for themselves, generously investing time and money in cultural life and health management.\\n\\nLee Hyung-gi (52, pseudonym), who runs a business, is a representative flower middle-aged man. He exercises daily under a personal trainer's guidance and receives skin care once a week. For anti-aging, he receives 'Thermage' skin lifting treatment once a year and has undergone laser treatment to remove spots and blemishes and surgery to remove under-eye fat. Every morning before going to work, he carefully applies BB cream before leaving home. To avoid giving a stiff feeling, he wears scarves instead of ties and prefers colored shoes in brown or navy rather than black.\\n\\n\\\"I think I spend about 1 million won [approximately $750 USD] per month on appearance. Since I run a business, I meet people frequently and have to pay a lot of attention to appearance. Thanks to this, I often hear people say I 'look young' or am 'young-looking.' It seems like they're recognizing my value, so I'm secretly proud. I think 'flower middle-aged' ultimately means people who have the leisure to invest time and money in appearance.\\\"\\n\\nKim Seong-cheol (47), who works at a foreign company. His hobbies were drinking, and on holidays, becoming a mermaid princess (lying sideways with legs crossed, not moving and only watching TV) - but recently he's struggling to be reborn as a flower middle-aged man. It's because of his eldest son Dong-jun (8), who recently entered elementary school. \\\"I married late, so my children are still young compared to my peers. When I went to my son's kindergarten for a class observation, I heard that his friends teased him saying his dad was old, and I thought this wouldn't do.\\\" Kim reduces drinking sessions and exercises at least three times a week. He bought expensive shampoo and toner to prevent hair loss and visits a beauty salon once a month for coloring and scalp massage. He bought men's cosmetics for skin care and even received Botox treatment timed for Dong-jun's elementary school entrance ceremony. \\\"It started to boost my child's spirits, but now I'm satisfied with how I look. Since I thought I was still young, I was lazy about health and appearance, but from now on I want to be faithful not only to appearance but also to life for my inner self.\\\"\\n\\nMiddle age is a generation 'caught' between the young and elderly generations, a confusing time when one is neither young nor old. Also called the second adolescence or 'sa-chu-gi' (思秋期), it's a psychologically unstable period with much conflict, along with adolescence.\\n\\nJung (Carl Gustav), the founder of analytical psychology and a Swiss psychiatrist, defined middle age as 'life's noon' that divides life's first and second halves, noting the 'midlife crisis' by saying 'people experience important life turning points in middle age, causing serious inner changes.' However, he viewed the midlife crisis as a kind of self-healing process and emphasized that it was a healthy change appearing in mature people.\\n\\nMiddle-aged men who have invested time and money for their families rather than themselves often don't know what they really want to do or how they can be happy. While there's no need to necessarily follow the trend of flower middle-aged men created by consumer society, if they at least start by listening to their inner desires, they can find happiness regardless of age.\\n\\n- Kim Kyung-cheol, Seoul correspondent for Japan's Kodansha News Magazine Division\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 12530, "output_tokens": 5691, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Universities have been too passive compared to political circles, bureaucrats, and business leaders. They have abandoned their responsibilities. The twin engines that led the last century—universities and media—must speak up again and set direction. With Seoul National University maintaining silence, expectations are particularly high for you two as presidents of prestigious private universities.\\n\\nYeom Jae-ho: How can Seoul National University, which is essentially a national university despite corporatization, speak out loudly? It's natural for them to stay quiet (laughs).\\n\\nSong: Still, 10 years ago they occasionally made critical remarks about entrance exam reform and such. But now... I recently watched the match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol [a Korean professional Go player], and it made me reflect on what universities have prepared. I think the presidents of Yonsei University and Korea University, the most important institutions for nurturing 21st-century talent, bear the burden of our times.\\n\\nKim Yong-hak: The AlphaGo incident actually made it much easier to explain my educational philosophy that universities must start matching pace for the next 100 years. Today's freshmen will live until age 100, until 2100. What meaning does industrial society's educational approach have for such generations? Education that nurtures narrow specialists will lose half its meaning in the age of artificial intelligence. AlphaGo was an incident that helped my message about preparing for the next 100 years.\\n\\nYeom: In Gheorghiu's novel '25 O'Clock,' submarines always carry rabbits aboard. But rabbits react faster than humans to oxygen-deficient situations. Universities and intellectuals must play exactly that role. Universities must completely change. The 'pioneering intellectuals' I emphasize are exactly such talents. I met Jeremy Rifkin in Italy 10 years ago. We agreed that the 'employment society' is over. Yet Korea still considers employment rates in university evaluations. I read an interesting article in a daily newspaper. When asked 'Why do large corporations hire new employees?', an HR manager said, \\\"What kind of employment policy is the youth employment policy? That's welfare policy.\\\" Meaning if left alone, no one would hire anyone. As President Kim said, social systems are almost entirely networking structures, yet we still try to solve problems with 20th-century methods. Facing the 21st century's civilizational transformation, universities must be completely overturned.\\n\\nSong: That's where the problem lies. I sometimes tell my students in class: \\\"Since you belong to the top 0.5%, don't steal other people's jobs. Give them to the 99.5%. Go out and create jobs yourselves.\\\" Then they look bewildered. Is this a fantasy? In what direction should university education go?\\n\\nKim: It's 'going from inside the classroom to outside.' Concepts like problem solving or active learning—students define humanity's historical problems encountered in local communities and the global village, and find ways to solve them. Educational reform has begun. I think that's real practical education and a model that enhances public value.\\n\\nSong: Social science students mainly learn about community, power, and human behavior only through theory. So educational approaches involving direct participation in local communities and organizations are very desirable. We need an exit that tears down university walls. I heard Korea University has a building that only allows discussions?\\n\\nYeom: We're going to build it. It's SK Future Hall. A new concept with no lecture rooms. We must break fixed ideas. My three-no policy and flexible semester system are like that. Stanford University's president said, \\\"We don't talk about employment rates. We value how much entrepreneurship there is and how much it contributes to GDP.\\\" Well-trained, standardized specialists are no longer needed. As President Kim said, we must create people who solve problems. Opening 20 courses by dividing principles of economics into groups of 50 doesn't make sense.\\n\\nSong: Professors must also change, and teaching methods must evolve.\\n\\nYeom: Korea University offers about 10,000 courses. Harvard and Stanford offer about 2,500. Previously, people went to Seoul National University, Yonsei University, and Korea University to meet good professors, but now we have videos and internet. It's important to draw out students' qualities, but we only try to cram things in, so things must change.\\n\\nSong: Money is indeed important. U.S. private university tuition is around $50,000 annually.\\n\\nYeom: In QS World University Rankings, Seoul National University is 38th and Korea University is around 100th, yet University of Southern California, which charges $50,000, ranks much lower than us. This is a miracle, a miracle. We don't invest but only expect miracles. If tuition is to be frozen, the central government should cover the budget shortfall like in Europe. But 80% of education budget goes to elementary, middle, and high schools. It's serious. Either give more money or grant financial autonomy to private universities, but half-price tuition has become ideologized.\\n\\nKim: We were talking about civilizational transformation and suddenly you're talking about money.\\n\\nSong: This problem must be solved to achieve civilizational transformation.\\n\\nKim: President Yeom has started reforms, and though I haven't been in office long, I have plans. When universities struggle, shout, and intellectually diagnose problems, does society listen attentively? Our status has fallen too much and society doesn't understand our situation of groaning under half-price tuition. Reaching the brink of collapse is also due to society's lack of awareness about universities' importance. Universities are the future. If this is the current state of universities, our future is bleak.\\n\\nYeom: I 100% agree, but universities also have problems. Presidents haven't functioned as leaders. There are no presidents like Kim Sang-hyeop or Baek Nak-jun from the 1970s. No one listens. Only when we completely reform educational methods will people pay attention. What's most important at the undergraduate level is strengthening basic foundations like liberal arts and humanities, as presidents like Cho In-won of Kyung Hee University and President Kim Yong-hak do, but professors don't follow well.\\n\\nSong: Professors sit in hundreds of caves. That's why Korea University and Yonsei University presidents must take charge of this great transformation's vanguard. Representative private universities must raise the flag to make it possible. The core is 'abandon bureaucratic regulations' and 'if you want to control tuition, increase financial support.'\\n\\nYeom: The Ministry of Education turns everything into projects while claiming to distribute money. They tell us to line up and win projects. That destroys universities. To truly nurture Nobel Prize winners, we should introduce a system that selects only about 1,000 students from 10 major universities, provides full scholarships and living expenses, and guarantees graduate school. It wouldn't even cost 100 billion won [approximately $75 million USD]. But they keep creating KAIST, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, etc., giving them 200 billion won [approximately $150 million USD] annually. They give Seoul National University 370 billion won [approximately $280 million USD]—it's the height of inefficiency. If they just provided 50 billion won [approximately $38 million USD] to Yonsei University and Korea University, we'd really do well.\\n\\nKim: It's because we're a society of distrust that regulations have strengthened. I understand, but the important thing is that government, especially the Ministry of Education, must change. We need coevolution—evolving together. There were many universities that embezzled money before. So regulations had to emerge and the Ministry of Education evolved that way.\\n\\nSong: Coevolution where universities and government change simultaneously is important. How should the entrance exam system be changed? Is it better to just leave the problems of autonomous private high schools, science high schools, and foreign language high schools alone? Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education says they'll gradually eliminate them...\\n\\nYeom: Just be faithful to original purposes. Foreign language high schools should nurture students good at foreign languages, science high schools should nurture students good at science. But some science high school has the lowest Seoul National University admission rate. Why? Because they all go to medical school. Yet the government still funds them. If they all go to medical school, create medical high schools. That's exactly what the Ministry of Education should regulate. Regulations go in wrong directions.\\n\\nSong: You mean the Ministry of Education ignores such important regulations while constantly pressuring only private universities?\\n\\nYeom: KAIST was originally Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. But it became a comprehensive university doing business, arts, and social studies. This won't do. Then they impose all sorts of regulations on private universities—it's not a fair society. University finances are like this. Japan's Waseda University and Keio University cover 7% of their budget with application fees. We must spend it all. There are even restrictions. There are guidelines for professors' supervision fees.\\n\\nSong: You can't breathe (laughs).\\n\\nKim: Universities' desire to recruit excellent students is like sunflowers turning toward the sun. Since special-purpose high school graduates are excellent, we ended up recruiting many. Then the hagwon education market formed enormously. So we developed tension about needing to enhance public value. It's an effort to recruit diversely through regional quotas, special talents, invention specialists, etc.\\n\\nYeom: You said diversification?\\n\\nKim: Yes. But criticism poured in that it's too complex. Here's what's important: because of the six-application limit for early admissions, you can only apply to six places. If I want to go to both Yonsei University's business school and mathematics department, that counts as two applications. This is a stupid regulation.\\n\\nSong: Wouldn't it be unfair if wealthy or capable students applied to twenty places?\\n\\nKim: There are separate quotas like rural/fishing village tracks, so it's not a problem. Their skills may be slightly lower right after admission, but after four years they're almost the same. I feel rewarded. I definitely want to propose this once: what does 'susi' [early admission] mean? It literally means 'anytime.' But why set periods for early admission? Let us do it anytime.\\n\\nSong: You mean recruit all year round?\\n\\nKim: Exactly. So we want to go to any high school anytime and say 'Hey, you're accepted.' We can show what kind of student it is later. We'll disclose all documents. Civic groups can review fairness. We should really be able to recruit anytime.\\n\\nYeom: Previously, science high school students could advance to university after completing just second year, but that's gone now. They say it ruins high school classes. Early advancement students could take time to contemplate and read books, but I don't understand why they try to make them excel in all subjects. The Ministry of Education must have many concerns, so solution methods should be different. Don't just discuss at desks with education department professors—discuss together with universities. Open up early admissions, and if we do wrong, arrest us (laughs).\\n\\nDon't wait for cruise ships, build rafts for entrepreneurship\\n\\nSong: There's a problem with the Ministry of Education's role.\\n\\nYeom: I remember former Education Minister Ahn Byeong-young's words. Education, especially higher education, could go to committees like the Korea Communications Commission. Elementary, middle, and high schools are the responsibility of education offices and local governments. If education offices create really good schools, Seoul people will move. Looking at Hana High School's struggles, school management is too difficult. Useless regulations are too severe. To really do it, they should crack down on hagwon education in regulatory blind spots. They should go to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] and make them all close.\\n\\nKim: I didn't know you were such a radical anti-market advocate (laughs).\\n\\nYeom: KTU (Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, a left-leaning teachers' organization) should demonstrate to close Daechi-dong hagwons. There really is 10 million won [approximately $7,500 USD] monthly essay-writing private tutoring. Korea University's annual tuition is 8 million won [approximately $6,000 USD], but that doesn't cover even half the total education costs.\\n\\nKim: If we look at students' potential and recruit them anytime through early admission, we can neutralize the hagwon education market.\\n\\nSong: You mean recruit regardless of CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam)?\\n\\nKim: Yes. Select through school records, activities, and early admission interviews.\\n\\nYeom: Then high school normalization would happen too. We wanted to recruit 50% of our quota that way, exploring all year round. It's about going on business trips to local areas to find hidden gems year-round. There are two prerequisites: that the public trust us when at least Yonsei University or Korea University does this, and that the Ministry of Education allows us to recruit year-round through early admission.\\n\\nSong: Let me summarize. Due to equality-oriented mindset, it's difficult to nurture creative talents to lead the 21st century, and entrance exam system problems are serious. What kind of talents do you intend to nurture?\\n\\nKim: According to research by Nobel Economics Prize winner Heckman from America, people with soft skills—character, personality, and considerate hearts—have higher success probability than those who are smart and study well. Korea is the same. We see that students with good character and interpersonal relationships succeed for long periods. That's the type of talent Yonsei University demands. We'll change the entrance exam system in that direction too.\\n\\nSong: Isn't the SKY [Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University] university entrance exam system controlling everything?\\n\\nKim: Korea University plans to provide work-study scholarships so students can work part-time. On weekends, they go to schools in Gangbuk [northern Seoul, generally less affluent than Gangnam] to teach sincere and talented kids. We're creating Daechi-dong's counterpoint in Gangbuk.\\n\\nSong: Do you do it without receiving money?\\n\\nYeom: We're trying to nurture so-called 'dirt spoon' [underprivileged] kids. We eliminated merit-based scholarships and instead increased work-study students doing this kind of work. Stop working at Seven-Eleven, and if you teach twice a week, we give 120,000 won [approximately $90 USD]. Four weeks would be about 500,000 won [approximately $380 USD]. Currently hagwons monopolize the private tutoring market, so students have no opportunities. We'll teach exam students at schools on weekends.\\n\\nKim: Yonsei University is doing it in Seodaemun-gu [a district in Seoul]. We're using 700 million won [approximately $530,000 USD] and mobilizing 80 students to teach underprivileged kids. But local governments won't participate.\\n\\nSong: Youth problems are serious.\\n\\nKim: The older generation's perception must change. To a generation with anxiety, uncertainty, and even no hope, warm encouragement and apologies would be good, but they say 'We went through that too, man.' They need comfort and simultaneously something concrete. I opened and operated entrepreneurship studies. I nurtured 9 teams one semester, then 8 teams the next—some teams actually started businesses and generated revenue. Instilling entrepreneurial spirit is important. I define entrepreneurship as a cultural movement. In May, we're converting the library's center into an entrepreneurship space. It's entrepreneurship phase 1.\\n\\nSong: The concept of entrepreneurship as cultural movement is good.\\n\\nYeom: I often tell students 'No cruise ship will come if you wait in line. Make your own raft or yacht and go out.' But reality isn't like that. Large corporation starting salaries are high—would any student refuse that? According to Korea Employers Federation, our large corporations' starting salaries average 42 million won [approximately $32,000 USD], 39% more than Japan's. So who would take risks? Telling students to start businesses might be like pushing penguins into water. In today's ecosystem, if you fail at entrepreneurship, your life is over. That's why I proposed 'knowledge charging stations.' Create 10,000 knowledge charging stations at universities as shelters that pay salaries to young people returning after failed startups. Annual salary of 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] guaranteed for 3 years would be enough. Entrepreneurship reserves—300 billion won [approximately $230 million USD] could maintain it. In a country spending 19 trillion won [approximately $14 billion USD] on R&D, we can't spare this 300 billion won [approximately $230 million USD]. Then entrepreneurship students would line up.\\n\\nKim: Entrepreneurship centers for working adults are also important, but we want universities used as failure practice centers. Since failure is tolerated for students, they gain more wisdom. When entering society, they can try other attempts from better positions. Even without going to entrepreneurship, they should tackle major global problems. It would be good to connect university entrepreneurship with government's creative economy—why must they operate separately? Combining university education, entrepreneurial ideas, and social problem-solving would kill two or three birds with one stone.\\n\\nSong: Now it's not cruise ships but rafts—the raft theory is important. Board and cross. However, we need to create social safety nets for that. Do you confidently have research teams capable of creating work at both universities?\\n\\nKim: Looking at entrepreneurship revenue growth trends gives hope. Last year's 3.7 billion won [approximately $2.8 million USD] increased to 5.7 billion won [approximately $4.3 million USD] this year. Companies incubated through our entrepreneurship support organization are earning money.\\n\\nSong: I heard Seoul National University selects star professors and supports them with 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] annually. Professor support is important, but every university should have systems that can identify students' creative ideas and care for them for at least 2-3 years.\\n\\nKim: We're trying to change the trend of churning out papers like mandatory military service. Without doing at least that, even researchers risk giving up. Evaluation criteria must shift to quality standards.\\n\\nSong: Professor evaluation started 20 years ago. All professors became riflemen. So how about both universities making really bold changes? Throw out some topics.\\n\\nSong: President Kim is an expert in networking theory—let's create collective creativity through university networking too. Current universities are isolated cells. If you could concretize the new university model both of you envision?\\n\\nKim: Resource pooling based on shared economy concepts. Inter-university alliances. Korea University and Yonsei University sharing all personnel and facilities they possess and increasing institutional compatibility. For example, Yonsei University professors could lecture at Korea University anytime, Korea University professors could come to Yonsei University, and they could use each other's spaces.\\n\\nSong: Does this include student exchange and credit exchange?\\n\\nYeom: Yes. That's exactly creative destruction. Schumpeter talked about creative destruction—to break paradigms, leading groups must show themselves struggling. Not 'Youth, be angry' but show a model for swimming across. What would happen to society if Korea only produces inheritance-wealthy people? The resource-sharing model is the first step toward creative destruction and a way to nurture self-made figures.\\n\\nAgreements and proposals from both presidents\\n\\nSong: Your views seem to have broad common ground. Please step forward on the reform front. Let me organize today's discussion by keywords.\\n\\nKim: The Ministry of Education must support universities' self-reform. This is possible only when universities and the Ministry of Education change simultaneously (coevolution principle).\\n\\nYeom: Give us discretion to select students anytime through early admission. Early admission should be early admission (early admission discretion).\\n\\nKim: Resource sharing between Korea University and Yonsei University. We want to develop a resource pooling system sharing all resources including faculty, courses, facilities, students, and credit exchanges (resource pooling). Simultaneously, we'll nurture social talents with good character, personality, and interpersonal relationships (character education).\\n\\nYeom: We must build entrepreneurship halls to nurture job creators. Government should create entrepreneurship safety nets, and universities should serve as knowledge charging stations that can embrace entrepreneurship failures (entrepreneurship raft theory).\\n\\nKim: We must change quantitative evaluation systems. We must boldly break the reality of everyone becoming riflemen (university and professor evaluation system reform).\\n\\nYeom: The Ministry of Education must change project-centered private school support. Give private schools financial autonomy and increase support to nurture 21st-century talents (financial support).\\n\\nSong: Thank you for your excellent remarks over this long time. Let's meet again in two years to assess progress.\\n\\nWritten by Song Ho-geun, Seoul National University Professor of Sociology\\nPhotograph by Oh Sang-min, Reporter\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10855, "output_tokens": 5045, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

His perfectionist father often worked at home even after returning from work, and the four brothers, including Director Choi who was the eldest son, had no choice but to stay as quiet as possible to avoid disturbing their father's mood. The boisterous scene of brothers hitting and playing with each other was hard to find in his house. \\\"If father bit into a stone while eating rice his mother had prepared, he would spit out the rice he was chewing and slam down his spoon with a 'thud.' Mother would immediately clear the table and wash the rice again to cook new rice. I still remember how the table mother was carrying out trembled 'rattle rattle rattle.' On such days, mother would be scolded by father all night long, hearing things like 'What are you doing at home that you can't even cook rice properly? A person must be perfect. There should be no mistakes.'\\\"\\n\\nIn front of such a father, there was only one thing where mother would not bend her stubbornness: matters concerning the children's education. Director Choi's mother judged that the frequent moves due to the nature of being a military officer would not be good for the children, so she left the children at her brother's house in Seoul. This was even before Director Choi entered elementary school. Even when her husband yelled, \\\"What difference does it make where they study? Even if you study on an overturned apple crate in the Gangwon mountains, those who will succeed will all succeed,\\\" she did not back down. \\\"Father had no choice but to think that way. He had farmed in the Gangwon countryside while studying and was accepted to the Korea Military Academy in his second year of high school with a four-year scholarship. He was the only one accepted from all of Gangwon Province and was apparently called a genius. When I was young and went to the countryside, all the adults knew father.\\\"\\n\\nThree of the four brothers grew up to become university professors\\n\\nDirector Choi's mother's educational fervor was never broken under any circumstances. She often said, \\\"No matter what happens, I will definitely support all four brothers.\\\" It was also his mother's will that he received expensive private tutoring in sixth grade. At that time, entrance exams started from middle school, and you had to enter a prestigious middle school to easily advance to a prestigious high school and prestigious university, so elementary schools with many students accepted to prestigious middle schools naturally became popular. Not satisfied with transferring him from Seoul's Woosin Elementary to Seoul's Gyodong Elementary, when his grades didn't come out satisfactorily, his mother began searching for a private tutor. This was because the majority of students in his class were receiving private tutoring. However, Director Choi's family was not well-off, and with his younger brother suffering from heart disease, the family finances were gradually declining. \\\"At that time, paying for my brother's hospital bills with father's salary alone must have been difficult. In that situation, receiving private tutoring made me think a lot even at a young age about what it meant.\\\"\\n\\nWhen in dire straits, one finds a way. Mother, who would not bend her will despite father's opposition, found a method. She obtained information that someone who had served in the military under father had become a famous private tutor. That very day, she took Director Choi's hand, went to find the private tutor, and earnestly requested. Rather than the private tutor, the other team members' mothers unanimously opposed it. \\\"They had no choice because the children receiving tutoring together were only from the highest class - the hospital director's son, the Vice Minister of Communications' son, etc. The other mothers all said in unison, 'We can't include someone from Seoul's outskirts. What if our children's level drops too?'\\\" However, his mother knelt down on the spot and pleaded, \\\"Please just accept him, you can treat our child as if he doesn't exist.\\\" Seeing that scene, Director Choi felt something unknown stirring in his heart. It was a complex mix of emotions including anger and defiance. \\\"My pride was hurt, and I also resolved to study hard. This expectation from mother served as a lighthouse for me throughout my school years. Even when I was wandering, it brought me back to my place. The fact that three of the four brothers became university professors is all thanks to mother's educational fervor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How dare a woman call first\\\"\\n\\nBecause he grew up seeing his father's patriarchal and authoritarian appearance, he couldn't help but resemble him. When his girlfriend called first during university, he was so deeply entrenched in male chauvinism that he would say, \\\"How dare a woman call a man first?\\\"\\n\\n-Looking at you now, it's hard to imagine.\\n\\n\\\"I really was like that back then. Even though I hated my father's appearance, I ended up growing up that way too. But when I left for study in America and studied the discipline of evolutionary biology, I changed 180 degrees. I came to see and learn about the world with an open perspective. Meeting my current wife also had a positive influence. My father-in-law was also a professor, and it was hard to believe they grew up in the same Korea - it was such a liberal family. Seeing that, I naturally changed.\\\"\\n\\n-There must have been things you learned from your father too.\\n\\n\\\"Except for how harshly he treated mother, I deeply respect him in my heart. Father is someone who lives his life like the character for 'correct' (正). He is integrity itself. I have never seen him do anything that deviates from principles. Something that happened when I was in third grade left a deep impression. I opened the door without much thought after finishing school, and there was a box full of bundles of money in front of a gentleman in a suit. I had never seen that much money. I was surprised and closed the door and came out, but shortly after, I heard the sound of slapping along with the roar, 'How do you see me that you brought this?'\\\"\\n\\n-Was it a bribe?\\n\\n\\\"At that time, father was working as a discharge officer at Army Headquarters. It was a position where he could expedite discharges, so high-ranking officials made many requests. There was even a saying that 'if you work as discharge officer for six months, you can buy a house.' But father, I can say with certainty, never once did anything dishonest. This was in the 1960s when such things were commonplace. Thanks to that, mother still hates the word 'integrity' the most. If father had been just a little less upright, the family's livelihood could have been much more comfortable. He was truly a descendant of General Choi Yeong from the Goryeo period, who left the words 'regard gold like stone.' Thanks to that, I too have lived trying not to harm others and to walk the right path until now.\\\"\\n\\nThe secret to his son's SAT perfect score was reading\\n\\nUnlike his own father, Director Choi raised his child freely. He would jokingly say to his wife, 'What fortune was our son born with to meet a father like me?' \\\"When I was young, seeing my authoritarian and strict father, I made two decisions. It was when father was eating and bit into a stone, mother was trembling as she cleared the table, and we brothers sat holding our breath. One was 'later when I marry, even if a stone comes out of the rice my wife makes, I will chew and swallow it without my wife knowing,' and the other was 'I want to be a soft red-bean porridge father to my child.'\\\"\\n\\nThe child born after nine years of marriage was like a treasure to the couple, but both were clumsy at child-rearing while studying in a distant foreign land. However, they had the chance to learn an excellent educational method through a coincidental opportunity. It was when an elderly couple, whom his wife who majored in music met while conducting a church choir, visited their home saying they wanted to see the child. \\\"The elderly couple told the child, who was only 100 days old, all sorts of stories about how the world works. What happened in the neighborhood yesterday, what the president said on the news, how the world is turning. When we looked puzzled, the grandmother said, 'Do you think the child doesn't understand? Absolutely not. The child understands everything we say.' It was like being hit on the head with a hammer.\\\"\\n\\nAfter that, they changed their child-rearing method. They, who had spent their days just feeding, sleeping, and playing peek-a-boo, tried to fill the child's mind with knowledge. The couple took turns telling about what happened during the day and read books to the child every single day without fail. They read aloud not only children's books but also specialized books and papers next to the child. Not only the couple but also the Harvard dormitory students, for whom they were serving as house masters at the time, would chat with the child about articles from The Economist and what happened in school classes whenever they had time.\\n\\nWhen the child was three years old, something like this happened. Director Choi fell asleep while reading a book due to fatigue, and the child was reading the book by himself. \\\"He wasn't reading the letters but remembering the book's content and saying it out loud. We had read that one book over 50 times, so it was natural he would memorize it. But his ability to acquire language and his memory were exceptional. I could see how important it is to read books to babies.\\\"\\n\\n-Did the child consistently love reading?\\n\\n\\\"Before going to college, he must have read at least 1,000 books, possibly thousands. He liked all fields without discrimination. Even though his school grades were terrible when he attended international school, seeing him get accepted to prestigious American universities, you can't ignore the power of reading. Even taking the American college entrance exam SAT without any preparation, he always received scores close to perfect. When I asked the child 'what's the secret to getting good scores,' the answer was always the same: 'Dad, all the answers are in books.' Actually, he basically went to school to play. He wouldn't even do coloring homework, saying he didn't want to.\\\"\\n\\n-Many students even receive hagwon education to get good SAT scores.\\n\\n\\\"We couple also sent our child to an SAT prep hagwon. But due to a small incident, he quit before even attending a week. When the SAT test format completely changed, the hagwon conducted a test, and our child got perfect scores in all subjects. It was amazing. Several parents started raising objections, saying 'Does it make sense to get 100 points on a test format that's being administered for the first time? Something's strange,' and the child said 'I want to stop going.' The child's logic was always 'SAT is similar to an IQ test, so there's no need to prepare in advance.'\\\"\\n\\n-At first glance, he seems like an 'exemplary friend's child.'\\n\\n\\\"Right. He grew up without any deficiencies. In short, he had no intensity at all. He's a son I love so much it wouldn't hurt to put him in my eye, but I often thought 'I raised him wrong.' In my view, the child was selfish, only doing what he wanted to do. I sometimes fell into self-loathing at the fact that I had sent such a child into the world. My wife had different thoughts from me. Her logic was that if love overflows, you naturally give that much love to others. Fortunately, I had two opportunities to confirm this.\\\"\\n\\n-What kind of incidents?\\n\\n\\\"Before college graduation, the child made a bombshell announcement. He said he would go to Johannesburg, South Africa with friends to do volunteer work. The plan was to teach local children for a year, play basketball with them, and give them new life opportunities. Since it was a place famous for poor security, my wife tried to dissuade him. She told him to go to Taiwan or Malaysia instead. But the child wouldn't bend his will, saying 'I must go because it's a dangerous place.' At that time, I honestly almost shed tears of emotion. It was because of my conviction that we hadn't raised our son wrongly. The child stayed in South Africa for a year and even received an award from the South African government for his recognized contribution to the local community.\\\"\\n\\n-What was the other incident?\\n\\n\\\"I had the opportunity to read my child's college application essay. It was an essay I couldn't see even once when he was applying to colleges. The child, whose school grades were rock bottom but whose SAT scores were excellent, gave amazingly philosophical excuses in his essay about why his school grades had to be bad. The content was that 'he already enjoys many things, and if someone who has more gets even more, the world wouldn't be beautiful.' Simply put, he said he didn't study hard to give opportunities to people who were less fortunate than himself. The writing was so persuasive that I nodded my head several times while reading. It was an incident where I discovered my child's true nature in my own way.\\\"\\n\\n-Did your usual philosophy of 'if you know, you love' work?\\n\\n\\\"Yes. The same goes for father. It's not that there weren't times I hated him, but when I got to know him, I realized father also had great love. I first felt this when I went to study in America. When I first said 'I want to go study abroad,' father was firmly opposed. After failing to get into Seoul National University medical school twice that father wanted, and barely getting accepted to the zoology department, and then spending time on club activities and playing rather than studying, when his son said 'please help with the cost of studying abroad,' even I would have been flustered. But at that time, I was really desperate and earnestly requested. Father, who understood my intention, quit POSCO where he was working after being scouted from Army Headquarters to provide study abroad funds. Later I learned that rather than money, he retired to spend time with me. After setting out for study abroad, I believed that studying hard was the only way to repay father's love. It's the same with family relationships and other human relationships. When you get to know the other person, you can't help but love them more. Think about walking home with a child you used to bully and having a conversation after meeting by chance. After that, could you still ostracize that child after visiting their home and greeting their mother? I think most human relationship problems are misunderstandings that occur when people don't know each other well. Nature is the same. Insects or trees that look disgusting and useless on the surface all have elements worth loving and cherishing when you get to know them. This is my motto, the reason I pursue academics, and the life value I want to convey not only to my child but to people.\\\"\\n\\nChoi Jae-cheon Profile\\nBorn 1954 in Gangneung, Gangwon Province\\n1972: Graduated from Seoul Kyungbok High School\\n1977: Graduated from Seoul National University College of Natural Sciences, Zoology\\n1982: Earned Master's degree in Ecology from Pennsylvania State University Graduate School, USA\\n1989: Received Young Scientist Award from American Entomological Society\\n1990: Earned PhD in Biology from Harvard University Graduate School, USA\\n1990-92: Harvard University lecturer, USA\\n1992-94: University of Michigan professor, USA\\n1994-2006: Seoul National University College of Life Sciences professor\\n2000: Received 1st Korea Science Culture Award\\n2006-present: Ewha Womans University Division of EcoScience chair professor\\n2007-2009: President of Korean Society of Ecology\\n2013-present: Director of National Institute of Ecology\\n2014-present: Technical Support Unit head of Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)\\n2013-present: Alternative chair of Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\\n\\n●Life role model: American professional basketball legend Julius Erving.

While A served as college admissions director, this school established itself as a prestigious school as the number of early admissions acceptances to top-tier universities continued to increase. An official from a college entrance exam company said, \\\"This school built up its own entrance exam know-how by meticulously recording students' personalities, interests, and even the content of questions asked during class, then reflecting this in student records for early admissions preparation, earning high praise from parents.\\\" After being recruited by a hagwon, A, who had been a 'public education entrance exam expert,' now holds the title of 'entrance strategy research director' and is engaged in analyzing early admissions programs and giving special lectures for parents.\\n\\nRecently, entrance exam hagwons in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Mok-dong areas are busy recruiting current and former high school college guidance teachers. This is because the proportion of early admissions in university entrance is growing larger, and recently the student record comprehensive admissions program has emerged as a major early admissions track. The student record comprehensive admissions program is a selection process where universities comprehensively evaluate and select students based on academic grades recorded in student records, extracurricular activities such as clubs and awards, along with personal statements. This year, 29% of early admissions selections use the student record comprehensive admissions program. At 10 major universities in Seoul including Seoul National University, this ratio rises to 47%.\\n\\nA language hagwon in Daechi-dong, Gangnam [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] also recruited Teacher B, a former college guidance director from a famous foreign language high school in Seoul, early this year to take charge of 'student record comprehensive admissions specialized consulting.' Teacher C from an autonomous private school in Seoul said, \\\"Entrance exam companies survey students about teachers' reputations, and when the results come out well, they make recruitment offers.\\\" Another high school guidance director explained, \\\"There are quite a few cases where they contact department head teachers in their 50s and 60s who are approaching honorary retirement, persuading them to prepare for a 'second chapter in life.'\\\"\\n\\nThe reason hagwons are so enthusiastic about recruiting school teachers is the expectation that their college guidance counseling experience accumulated in school settings will be advantageous for the student record comprehensive admissions program. The student record comprehensive admissions program does not recognize external activities and external awards, but only reflects in-school activities and in-school awards. A college guidance teacher in Seoul analyzed, \\\"The student record comprehensive admissions program offers fewer advantages for hagwon education companies compared to other admissions tracks, and they also lack experience,\\\" adding \\\"This leaves them no choice but to turn their attention to current teachers.\\\" An official from a repeat test-taker [a student retaking CSAT after high school graduation] comprehensive hagwon that recruited a guidance director from a general high school in Gangnam last month said, \\\"We judged that teachers with guidance director backgrounds could be advantageous in the 'information war' since they have networks with universities.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding this, some point out that \\\"hagwon education companies are fueling parents' anxiety about the student record comprehensive admissions program.\\\" A teacher who is a former university admissions officer said, \\\"The hagwon education market has exploited parents' vague anxiety about the complex university entrance system,\\\" adding \\\"There's a need to increase teacher training and reduce information gaps about entrance exams between schools and teachers.\\\" The organization 'No More Worry about Hagwon Education' held a press conference on the 28th and suggested, \\\"Because extracurricular activities are overemphasized, the burden on students and parents regarding clubs, volunteer activities, and academic competitions is only increasing,\\\" proposing \\\"Four areas that could induce hagwon education - in-school awards, certification qualification exams, reading activities, and autonomous clubs - should not be reflected in university admissions.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3105, "output_tokens": 948, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

In her hands, she holds scales and a sword. The cloth-covered eyes symbolize impartial judgment, the scales represent the strict standards of law, and the sword symbolizes the swift execution of justice. Among these, the most striking is the scales. Without strict and credible standards, judgments and executions based on them cannot earn trust.\\n\\nConcerns and confusion are mounting over the CSAT English test that will switch to absolute assessment starting from the 2018 academic year. While the success of absolute assessment depends on establishing proper standards, criticism has been raised that the evaluation criteria are vague. If standards are not properly established, it will be difficult to have one's abilities recognized no matter how well one solves test problems. There are also concerns that 600,000 test-takers taking university entrance exams annually may fall into confusion, wandering with blindfolded eyes. To establish impartial and rigorous standards like Dike's scales, we have examined everything from the current state of English education in Korea to cases worth benchmarking.\\n\\nChanging Landscape of English Education\\nAbsolute Assessment: 1st Grade from 20,000 → 90,000 Students... \\\"Don't Need to Study English Anymore?\\\"\\n\\nAbsolute assessment perceived as easier test for 1st grade\\nGangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] lines: \\\"Reduce English classes and increase math\\\"\\nActual study time decreases, concerns about downward standardization\\n\\nStudents memorizing only EBS guidebook translations\\nShort passages, multiple choice... requiring only fragmentary thinking\\nNeed for evaluation methods like TOEFL that build English proficiency\\n\\nStarting from the 2018 academic year when current 11th graders take the CSAT, the CSAT English test will change to an absolute assessment method. This change follows the government's policy to eliminate unnecessary learning burden in English and reduce hagwon education [in Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry]. With news that the test evaluation method will change, not only school English classes but also the atmosphere in hagwon districts has changed. This is due to the characteristic of Korean education where middle and high school education is geared toward university entrance preparation. The biggest change is that high school students' English study time is decreasing. This is due to expectations that the CSAT English test will become easier with the introduction of absolute assessment. As interest in English decreases both in schools and hagwons, experts are voicing concerns that \\\"absolute assessment might create a downward standardization of English proficiency.\\\" The landscape of English education is changing with the introduction of English absolute assessment, implemented 22 years after the introduction of the CSAT.\\n\\nTurmoil Ahead of 2018 Absolute Assessment Transition\\nThe places that experienced the greatest turmoil with news of the CSAT English test transitioning to absolute assessment were high schools in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] area. This is because parents are raising voices demanding \\\"reduce English class hours and increase math classes, or just have students do self-study instead.\\\"\\n\\nIndeed, several schools plan to adjust English classes from six times a week to 4-5 times starting from the second semester. An English teacher at a Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] private high school said, \\\"Students in this area have high average English proficiency through short-term study abroad from elementary school and continuous hagwon education,\\\" adding \\\"After the absolute assessment introduction news was announced, as the thought of easily receiving 1st grade became widespread, enthusiasm for English cooled off the most.\\\"\\n\\nAnother English teacher in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] reported that \\\"students' concentration during class has noticeably dropped.\\\" \\\"Previously, top students were in an atmosphere of concentrating on class with tension that they might not receive 1st grade if they got even one problem wrong, but now they're taking care of other subjects first, saying 'I already have the ability to score 90 points in English, so there's no need to do more.'\\\"\\n\\nThe number of English hagwons is also decreasing. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, English hagwons decreased from 1,213 in 2009 to 986 in 2013, with only 871 remaining last year. Lee Mi-ae, director of Sharon Coaching and Mentoring Research Institute, said, \\\"Even Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] parents are not paying much attention to English hagwon education,\\\" explaining \\\"The recent trend is for top students to study English for university entrance only until middle school, and in high school, focus on math or receive high-quality English education at TOEFL hagwons.\\\"\\n\\nKim, director of an English hagwon in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, who is recruiting students for a 'CSAT preparation middle school class' for summer vacation, said, \\\"The number of 10th-12th grade students has noticeably decreased since the announcement of absolute assessment introduction.\\\" He added, \\\"Especially top students who are confident of receiving 1st grade tend to quit all English hagwon education except for school record hagwons,\\\" and \\\"Other hagwons are also finding a way out by reorganizing CSAT English classes that targeted high school students to target middle school students.\\\" A middle school parent who visited this hagwon said, \\\"I heard that since the CSAT has become easier, students should finish entrance exam English in middle school and focus on math when they go to high school to get into good universities,\\\" asking \\\"Wouldn't there be no need to exert effort on CSAT English in high school?\\\"\\n\\nThese changes occur because the introduction of English absolute assessment is interpreted as meaning \\\"it has become easier to receive 1st grade in English subjects.\\\" With the current relative assessment grading method, one must be in the top 4% to receive 1st grade. If perfect scorers exceeded 4% of test-takers, getting even one problem wrong would slide one down to 2nd grade or lower. Intense competition for 'absolute perfect scores' was inevitable to receive 1st grade. However, with absolute assessment introduction, all students scoring 90 points or above will receive 1st grade. When the Ministry of Education announced its policy to maintain the current easy CSAT trend, stating \\\"problems will be set at a level that any student who faithfully completes school education can solve,\\\" the perception of 'English absolute assessment = easy test' became official.\\n\\nAccording to data analyzed by Jongro Academy Sky Education, when converting the current CSAT English test to absolute assessment method as is, the number of 1st grade recipients would dramatically increase from 26,070 to 90,664. The total number of new students selected annually by Seoul universities combined is only slightly over 70,000. Arithmetically speaking, among 90,000 students who received 1st grade in English, 20,000 would have difficulty getting accepted to Seoul universities. There is also analysis that students passing major universities' minimum CSAT English standards would surge from around 69,000 to around 144,000. It has become virtually impossible to differentiate students with the CSAT English test changed to absolute assessment. This is why universities are reducing the reflection ratio of CSAT English test scores.\\n\\nProfessor Lee Byung-min of Seoul National University's English Education Department pointed out, \\\"If absolute assessment standards are not precisely calibrated and only increase the number of 1st grade recipients, it will ultimately only lower the importance of English subjects in university selection processes and deteriorate the quality of English learning during high school.\\\"\\n\\nConcerns arise that if absolute assessment is introduced without improving current CSAT test problems, Korean high school students' English proficiency will overall take a step backward. The government has not yet presented specific measures on how English tests will change after introducing CSAT absolute assessment.\\n\\nEnglish education experts unanimously agreed that \\\"problems currently possessed by the CSAT must be urgently improved ahead of absolute assessment introduction.\\\"\\n\\nThe first problem identified is 'English becoming a memorization subject due to high EBS linkage rates.' The current CSAT English test's linkage rate with EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] materials reaches 70-80%. Moreover, since even English passages are identically presented, test-takers prepare for English tests by memorizing Korean translations recorded in guidebooks instead of interpreting English texts and solving problems. 12th grade students say, \\\"Since passages from EBS appear identically in the CSAT anyway, memorizing guidebook translations is much more efficient than spending time reading comprehension myself, as guidebook translations are accurate.\\\"\\n\\nThis is also why Professor Lee points out that \\\"it's difficult to grasp what the CSAT English test actually measures,\\\" saying \\\"It's impossible to know whether it measures ability to communicate in English, evaluates linguistic knowledge of English, assesses high school academic achievement, or determines intellectual qualities for continuing studies at university.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that only short texts of 120 words are presented as problems is also pointed out as a problem with current CSAT English tests. This is because it only requires fragmentary and standardized thinking. Professor Lee Hyun-woo, department head of Inha University's English Education Department, criticized, \\\"When CSAT tests only deal with fragmentary and marginal problems, students focus only on simple memorization during school years without developing creative and critical thinking skills.\\\" The point is that if one only trains to think within standardized frameworks until adolescence, it becomes difficult to demonstrate creative thinking ability after becoming an adult.\\n\\nKim Seung-kyu, TOEFL star instructor at EBS LANG (EBS online foreign language learning site), also said, \\\"It's difficult to accurately judge students' abilities with only the current written examination format of simply choosing answers from given options.\\\" \\\"While comprehensive evaluation that simultaneously tests reading, listening, speaking, and writing like TOEFL would be desirable, realistically, introducing something like 'English essay writing' should be considered.\\\"\\n\\n▷Click here to see larger image\\n\\n\\\"CSAT Doesn't Improve English Proficiency\\\"\\nMany cited TOEFL as an exemplary case worth referencing for the CSAT English test changing to absolute assessment. Unlike the CSAT English test being criticized for not accurately measuring students' English proficiency, research papers have proven that TOEFL scores accurately evaluate students' actual English abilities. Professor Lee, department head, who wrote papers such as 'Validity of Official English Standardized Tests as Communication Ability Measurement Tools' and 'Research on the Relationship between TOEFL, TOEIC, TEPS Test Scores and University Academic Ability,' said, \\\"It's a proven fact that students with high TOEFL scores have high levels of understanding classes and performing assignments at university.\\\"\\n\\nIn a survey conducted by JoongAng Ilbo Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Correspondence targeting EBS LANG members, contrasting evaluations of CSAT English tests and TOEFL could be confirmed. Over half of respondents (54%) answered that the most effective method for preparing for CSAT English tests was 'memorizing past problems.' 51% also answered that 'repeatedly reviewing only specific textbooks (EBS materials) is sufficient.' In contrast, only 17% felt that 'English proficiency itself improves through CSAT test preparation,' and only 12% said understanding was more important than memorization. Additionally, they answered that for CSAT English tests, 'memorization is more important than understanding' (61%), 'grasping grammar and sentence structure takes priority over ability to converse with foreigners' (45%), and 'memorizing prescribed vocabulary is more effective than English debates' (45%).\\n\\nPerceptions of TOEFL were different. They thought that 'studying for improving common sense and thinking ability beyond English study is necessary' (62%), one should 'develop habits of expressing thoughts using English regularly' (64%), 'understanding is more important than memorization' (48%), and 'English proficiency itself improves through test preparation' (48%).\\n\\nProfessor Lee emphasized, \\\"The CSAT English test must improve both format and content before just changing the grading calculation method to absolute assessment,\\\" stressing \\\"The important task is to precisely design evaluation methods so that English proficiency can improve just by studying for tests, like TOEFL.\\\"\\n\\nEnglish Evaluation Standards Seen Through TOEFL\\nReading long texts and grasping context instead of grammar, evaluating writing and speaking abilities too\\n\\nTOEFL also had 'pinpoint lectures' [teachers known for accurately predicting exam questions] in early days\\nChanged to iBT requiring critical thinking abilities\\nJapanese and Chinese university entrance texts longer than Korea's\\n\\nChanges in evaluation methods can change classroom appearance. TOEFL testing actually did this. Shin Eun-mi, TOEFL instructor at English specialty hagwon Yeongdangi, said, \\\"Whenever TOEFL tests were upgraded, hagwon class appearance also changed.\\\"\\n\\nThe TOEFL test first implemented in 1964 wasn't much different from today's CSAT. For reading sections, short texts consisting of 250 words per passage were predominant. There were also many grammar problems. Professor Lee Byung-min of Seoul National University's English Education Department said, \\\"When I took TOEFL tests, there were problems in listening evaluation asking to find answers after hearing just one sentence.\\\" With standardized questions asking fragmentary knowledge levels, 'pinpoint lectures' [teachers known for accurately predicting exam questions] flourished at every hagwon. It wasn't uncommon for instructors to point out expected problems before tests, with test-takers memorizing only these to receive high scores.\\n\\nThis atmosphere changed with the introduction of iBT TOEFL in 2006. Instructor Shin said, \\\"When TOEFL tests changed to long text reading and speaking and writing were introduced, making it impossible to receive good scores through memorization alone, I began giving students advice like 'read texts while thinking' and 'engage in logical and critical thinking' during lectures,\\\" adding \\\"When evaluation methods change desirably, classes preparing for them must also develop.\\\"\\n\\nThere were two changes to TOEFL testing before the current iBT TOEFL existed. The first was changing from paper-based PBT (Paper-Based-Test) to computer-based CBT (Computer-Based-Test) starting in 1998. In evaluation content, grammar was removed and writing tests began. The current internet-based TOEFL test iBT (Internet-Based-Test) started in 2005. It was introduced in Korea from September 2006. Speaking sections were added at this time. Jennifer Brown, TOEFL Program Executive Director at ETS, the TOEFL organizing company, said, \\\"Starting with iBT, we began creating problems based on 'communication ability theory,' and comprehensive evaluation of four areas—reading, listening, speaking, and writing—is also based on this theory.\\\"\\n\\nKang Ki-nam, vice director of YBM Sisa Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Academy, explained, \\\"TOEFL has gradually excluded problems grasping grammar and short sentence structures, changing toward verifying whether students can actually attend classes and perform assignments when going to English-speaking universities.\\\"\\n\\nKorean students who study by identifying test types and learning high-scoring strategies fell into confusion whenever TOEFL test content and format changed. Instructor Park Se-yeon of Yeongdangi said, \\\"The period when students received the biggest shock was when speaking sections were added,\\\" adding \\\"To avoid taking speaking tests somehow, an enormous number of test-takers flocked to the previous month's TOEFL test.\\\"\\n\\nVice Director Kang also recalled, \\\"Whether public or hagwon education, Korea was about listening to lectures and memorizing without saying a word during English time, but speaking about one topic for 45 seconds in TOEFL was difficult to adapt to.\\\" Korean test-takers' TOEFL scores also dropped significantly at that time. Korea's TOEFL ranking, which was 77th among 134 countries in the June 2006 CBT test, dropped to 111th as soon as the iBT test with speaking sections first introduced began in September that year.\\n\\nHowever, it rose again to 58th among 166 countries in 2013. The ranking is higher than China or Japan, similar to Hong Kong. Vice Director Kang said, \\\"While Hong Kong has high speaking and writing section scores, Korea has the highest reading scores but relatively low speaking scores.\\\"\\n\\nTOEFL tests measure English ability in four areas: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. Professor Lee said, \\\"Reading sections present a total of three passages with about 650-750 words per passage, which is quite long compared to CSAT English test reading passages consisting of 120 words.\\\" Professor Lee explained, \\\"Evaluating long text reading ability in university entrance exams is also a global trend,\\\" adding \\\"Even Japan and China have English passage lengths 2-3 times longer than ours in domestic university selection tests.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Lee Byung-min said that 'finding grammatical errors' and 'filling blanks' commonly appearing in CSAT English tests are not actually English abilities universities need. Professor Lee, who says \\\"reading long texts and reading short texts evaluate completely different abilities,\\\" explained, \\\"Reading short texts requires knowing the exact meaning of each word, but reading long texts requires ability to grasp overall context rather than word meanings. Universities need ability to read at least one chapter of long text and organize one's thoughts, not reading methods that examine each sentence with a microscope to find grammatical errors.\\\"\\n\\nArticle by Park Hyung-soo, reporter hspark97@joongang.co.kr Photo by Kim Kyung-rok, reporter kimkr8486@joongang.co.kr\\n\\n[Cover Story]▶Targeting Women...

As millions of won worth of hagwon education for writing small research papers flourishes, comprehensive admissions has even been called the \\\"golden spoon admissions system.\\\" Some argue for the uselessness of comprehensive admissions, claiming \\\"CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] is more fair and objective\\\" and \\\"the proportion selected through CSAT should be drastically increased.\\\" Such arguments are gaining considerable sympathy among students and parents.\\n\\nOn the other hand, many teachers say \\\"comprehensive admissions has contributed to normalizing public education through curriculum diversification\\\" and \\\"arguing for abolition while ignoring its positive functions amounts to nothing more than regressing to the early 2000s when we worried about classroom collapse.\\\"\\n\\nJoongAng Ilbo's Open Study, together with Jongno Academy Sky Education [an entrance exam prep institution], surveyed 850 nationwide 2nd and 3rd year high school students (522 from general high schools, 328 from specialized/autonomous private schools) and 285 Seoul-area parents from the 20th-27th of last month about their opinions on comprehensive admissions. Results combined JoongAng Ilbo's survey of students at 5 Seoul-area high schools (2 general, 2 autonomous private, 1 specialized) with Sky Education Jongno Academy's online survey. For teacher opinions, we referenced results from a survey conducted by the National College Admissions Guidance Council (hereafter \\\"NCAGC\\\") targeting 385 middle and high school teachers nationwide from the 19th-22nd of last month.\\n\\nStudents and parents negative, teachers positive\\n▷Click here to view larger\\nThe perspectives of students/parents versus teachers on comprehensive admissions are starkly divided. Only 21.5% of students answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions contributes to normalizing public education.\\\" For the same question, only 18.9% of parents answered \\\"yes.\\\" However, in the survey of 385 middle and high school teachers, 76.6% responded that \\\"comprehensive admissions contributes to normalizing public education.\\\" Teachers hold positive views while students and parents hold predominantly negative views.\\n\\nThe burden felt by students and parents regarding comprehensive admissions was considerable. Among surveyed students, 39.8% chose comprehensive admissions as the most burdensome college entrance exam type to prepare for. 58.9% of parents answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions is most burdensome.\\\"\\n\\nRegarding fairness and objectivity, opinions between teachers and students/parents also differed greatly. While 56.1% of teachers answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions is a fair and objective evaluation system,\\\" only 19.4% of students and 11.6% of parents thought so.\\n\\nAccordingly, opinions on comprehensive admissions selection scale also differed greatly. While 39% of teachers answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions selection scale should be increased more than now,\\\" only 24.1% of students and 12.6% of parents supported expanding comprehensive admissions. Students and parents were dominated by opinions favoring reduction. 50.5% of students and 68.5% of parents answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions scale should be reduced from now.\\\"\\n\\nThe biggest reason students and parents feel burdened is that there are more than one or two elements to prepare for. They must manage school records [GPA] as well as extracurriculars like clubs, reading, and volunteer activities, while also preparing for CSAT. Kang, a 2nd-year student at a general high school in Seoul's Gangbuk-gu [a district in Seoul], said \\\"You have no choice but to become Superman\\\" and \\\"Since you can't only look toward comprehensive admissions, you can't reduce CSAT study time while doing extracurricular activities.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that it's qualitative rather than quantitative evaluation like CSAT also adds to confusion. Kang said \\\"For CSAT and essay-writing exams, there are many past problems and you can analyze question trends, so you can make plans about how much you need to do, but for comprehensive admissions I don't know the specific evaluation criteria themselves, so I have no sense of how to prepare.\\\"\\n\\nLim Byeong-wook, vice principal at Seoul's Inchang High School, pointed out \\\"It's time for universities to proactively consider more detailed disclosure of evaluation indicators.\\\" Vice Principal Lim said \\\"Some worry that if universities disclose specific evaluation indicators, the hagwon education market will grow, but right now restoring student and parent trust in comprehensive admissions is more urgent\\\" and \\\"If it's truly fair and objective evaluation, there's no reason each university can't disclose it.\\\"\\n\\nLee Seong-kwon, teacher at Seoul's Daejin High School (representative of the Korean Education Policy Teachers' Solidarity), pointed out \\\"Instead of expressing with ambiguous vocabulary like academic capability, major aptitude, self-direction, and character, they should explain with rich examples and concrete definitions what kind of student has major aptitude.\\\"\\n\\nIn this year's college admissions, total early admission recruitment is 248,669 students, reaching 69.9% of total recruitment. Of this, 72,101 students (20.3%) are recruited through comprehensive admissions. While it's just over 20% nationwide, when narrowed to top-tier Seoul universities, the selection scale is large at 30-40% of total recruitment. Seoul National University selects 76.7% (2,406 students) of this year's total recruitment through comprehensive admissions, and Korea University plans to abolish essay-writing admissions from the 2018 academic year and drastically increase comprehensive admissions. Kim (45, Seoul's Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who has a 2nd-year high school child, said \\\"Comprehensive admissions is now 'essential,' not 'optional'\\\" and \\\"With selection ratios this high, how can you not prepare?\\\"\\n\\nCriticisms arise that comprehensive admissions selection ratios are excessively high. Kim said \\\"Comprehensive admissions is disadvantageous for students who are quiet and passive and prefer studying over activities\\\" and \\\"For such students, it seems right to select half through CSAT.\\\" Ahn Yeon-geun, teacher at Seoul's Jamsil Girls' High School (president of Seoul College Admissions Guidance Council), said \\\"Since comprehensive admissions isn't suitable for all students, to give diverse students college admission opportunities, it's right for universities to maintain appropriate ratios of not just comprehensive admissions but also essays, special talents, and CSAT.\\\"\\n\\nWorry of 'only I will lose out' without consulting\\n▷Click here to view larger\\nSince comprehensive admissions evaluates school activities, admission results are greatly influenced by career and aptitude development programs provided by schools and teacher passion. Among 385 teachers participating in the NCAGC survey, 85.5% answered that \\\"comprehensive admissions can change students' admission results depending on the quality of individual schools' curricula and career/college prep programs,\\\" and 88.1% responded that \\\"students' admission results can change depending on teacher passion.\\\"\\n\\nStudents' satisfaction with school comprehensive admissions programs differed by school type. 36.3% of specialized/autonomous private school students answered that they \\\"receive help from school,\\\" but only 23.2% of general high school students said so. Conversely, \\\"not receiving help\\\" responses were higher for general high schools at 38.9% compared to specialized/autonomous private schools (25.6%). General high school students feel they receive less school help than specialized/autonomous private school students.\\n\\nStudents pointed to school program deficiencies in order of \\\"schools only care about some top-tier students\\\" (37.1%) and \\\"college counseling is irregular and inaccurate\\\" (15.9%). Kim, a 2nd-year student at a general high school in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], said \\\"With CSAT, at least there's hope that you can succeed through hard work, but with comprehensive admissions you often can't even get opportunities from the start\\\" and \\\"Schools only provide intensive management for top students within the top 10% in school records.\\\" Many schools operate various forms of comprehensive admissions-focused ability grouping under names like advanced classes, intensive study groups, and gifted classes. With limited school resources and funding but needing to produce comprehensive admissions guidance results, they focus only on a small number of top students.\\n\\nGaps between schools and teachers lead to hagwon education demand for consulting and personal statement editing. General high school students with lower satisfaction with school programs showed higher hagwon education dependence. 39.1% of general high school students answered that they \\\"need much hagwon education help,\\\" while the response rate for specialized/autonomous private school students was lower at 25.3%. General high school students answering \\\"receiving or planning to receive hagwon education\\\" were 47.9%, higher than specialized/autonomous private schools (43.3%).\\n\\nParents unanimously say \\\"if we don't receive consulting, only our child will lose out.\\\" Lee (51, Seoul's Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who has a 2nd-year high school child, said \\\"Teachers know even less than I do\\\" and \\\"The process of how they worked hard is important, but many teachers just record tons of results like 'did XX.'\\\"\\n\\nStudents also most frequently cited \\\"school records vary greatly depending on teachers\\\" as the biggest factor harming comprehensive admissions' fairness and objectivity.\\n\\nArguments emerge for creating unified standards for school record writing methods to overcome teacher gaps. A research paper titled \\\"Restructuring School Record Information\\\" announced by Seoul National University last February proposed \\\"It's necessary to institutionalize within schools a procedure where all teachers who handled students - homeroom teachers, subject teachers, career counselors, and club advisors - gather each semester and at year-end to share student evaluations and participate together in school record writing.\\\"\\n\\nChanges in frontline school and teacher awareness are also needed. Ju Seok-hun, principal of Seoul's Mirim Girls' High School, said \\\"Fundamentally, there are problems with teaching methods.\\\" Principal Ju said \\\"Many schools still rely on one-way lecture-style classes\\\" and \\\"When student-centered activities like presentations, discussions, and project assignments increase in classes, teachers have content to observe and can record processes in school records.\\\" He said \\\"Rather than focusing on creating unique extracurricular programs, it's important for schools to steadily carry out their fundamental work of developing and applying new teaching models.\\\"\\n\\nGeneral high schools improving teaching models see better college admission results\\n▷Click here to view larger\\nDespite various controversies, comprehensive admissions is clearly driving changes in frontline school settings. Teacher Ahn Yeon-geun said \\\"Ten years ago when I was in charge of drama club guidance, parents strongly opposed it saying it interfered with CSAT studying, but now parents welcome diverse club activities.\\\" Teachers unanimously say \\\"Since comprehensive admissions expanded, positive changes are occurring in many schools, including increased student-centered classes with presentations and discussions, and activated clubs.\\\"\\n\\nIn the NCAGC survey, 61.3% of 385 teachers answered that \\\"curricula have diversified since implementing comprehensive admissions,\\\" and 75.3% said \\\"students participate more actively in classes and school activities since implementing comprehensive admissions.\\\" Teacher Ahn evaluated \\\"When there was only CSAT, the widespread perception was that you just needed to go to hagwons and study for CSAT, and classroom collapse occurred with some specialized school students' group withdrawals\\\" and \\\"Compared to then, changes led by comprehensive admissions are clearly positive.\\\"\\n\\nMany also believe comprehensive admissions can provide opportunities for general high schools, not just specialized/autonomous private schools. Seongdeok High School in Seoul's Gangdong-gu is such an example. Seongdeok High converted from a commercial high school to a general high school in 2013. Kim Yu-dong, Seongdeok High's career guidance department head, recalled \\\"In the early period of general high school conversion, prejudices that academic levels would be low because it was formerly a commercial school followed like a label.\\\"\\n\\nThis school found answers in comprehensive admissions. They secured many young teachers and developed new teaching models. They judged that innovating school classes for the comprehensive admissions era was the only way to survive. This school created 100-minute block time classes combining two periods. 1st and 2nd year students conduct 100-minute block time classes once weekly each in Korean, English, math, social studies, and science subjects. Four days a week they have 50-minute classes for basic subject progress, and one day they conduct 100-minute classes. Teachers observe presentations, discussions, and experiments during the 100 minutes and record each student's comments in school records.\\n\\nAs block time class effectiveness became known, Seongdeok High developed into a popular school with 4-to-1 application ratios and improved college admission results. Department head Kim said \\\"About 90% of students who passed through comprehensive admissions among February graduates were students who would have had difficulty passing those schools with CSAT scores.\\\"\\n\\nInchang High School, a general high school in Seoul's Seodaemun-gu, also shows examples of school field changes in the comprehensive admissions era. This school of about 800 students has as many as 140 clubs. There are 60 R&E clubs conducting small research papers and discussions with teachers. Vice Principal Lim Byeong-wook said \\\"Teachers handle an average of 3 or more clubs each for guidance\\\" and \\\"After daily classes end, club activities occur actively in each classroom.\\\"\\n\\nArts and physical education is also notable. All 1st year Inchang High students belong to 51 bands and learn vocals, guitar, drums, etc. They brought the one-person-one-instrument education popular in specialized/autonomous private schools into general high schools. This school also extended its annual October one-day festival to three days starting last year. Student-planned festivals are good material for showing planning ability, self-direction, and cooperation that comprehensive admissions evaluates importantly.\\n\\nHowever, not all general high schools are quickly transforming to match comprehensive admissions. Teacher Ahn said \\\"Perspectives on comprehensive admissions vary even within teacher groups\\\" and \\\"A considerable number of schools still haven't escaped from regular admission (CSAT)-centered college guidance.\\\" Vice Principal Lim said \\\"Teacher dedication and effort must be prerequisites to change school systems for comprehensive admissions\\\" and \\\"Policy support to elicit teacher efforts is desperately needed.\\\"\\n\\nOpinions also exist that the Ministry of Education should expand financial support for general high schools. Currently, the Ministry of Education supports about 45 billion won [approximately $34 million USD] to universities nationwide under the name \\\"high school normalization project\\\" to expand comprehensive admissions. However, there's no financial support for general high schools. Teacher Lee Seong-kwon argued \\\"Government policy priorities are wrong\\\" and \\\"Financial support should be expanded so general high schools can innovate teaching models and operate diverse programs through excellent teacher incentive systems.\\\"\\n\\nBy reporters Jeong Hyeon-jin and Jeon Min-hee Jeon.hyeonjin@joongang.co.kr\\n\\n2016 Academic Year Analysis of Comprehensive Admissions Successful Candidates at 5 Universities Including Seoul National and Yonsei\\nComprehensive admissions successful candidates: 63.5% from general high schools, 25.7% from specialized/autonomous private schools\\n\\nThere's much criticism that the Comprehensive School Record Admissions system (hereafter \\\"comprehensive admissions\\\") is a golden spoon system advantageous to specialized/autonomous private school students. Some argue \\\"comprehensive admissions should be drastically reduced and regular admission (hereafter \\\"regular\\\") centered on CSAT should be increased.\\\" Is this really true? If regular admissions increase, can university doors open wider for general high schools than now?\\n\\nWe analyzed 2016 academic year successful candidate data by high school type from 5 universities - Kyung Hee, Seoul National, Yonsei, Ewha Womans, and Chung-Ang - to examine the ratios of general high school versus specialized/autonomous private school successful candidates in each university's comprehensive admissions and regular admissions. Analysis results showed general high schools had higher successful candidate ratios in comprehensive admissions than regular admissions, while specialized/autonomous private schools had higher ratios in regular admissions than comprehensive admissions.\\n\\nAmong the 5 universities' comprehensive admissions successful candidates, 63.5% (4,316 out of 6,796) were from general high schools, while among regular admissions successful candidates, the ratio from general high schools was 58.1% (3,247 out of 5,587). Conversely, successful candidate ratios from specialized/autonomous private schools were 25.7% (1,748 out of 6,796) for comprehensive admissions and 35.2% (1,967 out of 5,587) for regular admissions, with regular admission success ratios being higher. Lim Jin-taek, chief admissions officer at Kyung Hee University, explained \\\"Among college entrance exam types, the factor with the greatest hagwon education influence is CSAT\\\" and \\\"Disparities by high school type are more serious in CSAT-centered regular admissions than comprehensive admissions.\\\"\\n\\nRegional distribution of successful candidates also shows comprehensive admissions being more balanced than regular admissions. Looking at regional distribution of 1,820 general high school students who passed Seoul National University in 2016, students from Seoul-Gyeonggi regions comprised 46.9% (628 out of 1,339) in comprehensive admissions, while 66.1% (318 out of 481) were from Seoul-Gyeonggi in regular admissions. Seoul-Gyeonggi regional concentration was more severe in regular admissions than comprehensive admissions.\\n\\nNarrowing the analysis to within Seoul, examining distribution of general high school students from educational special districts like Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Seocho, Songpa, Yangcheon, and Nowon versus non-educational special districts, educational special district graduates reached a whopping 80.3% (143 out of 178) in regular admissions. In contrast, educational special district graduates were only 54.4% (215 out of 395) in comprehensive admissions. This means comprehensive admissions keeps doors more widely open for general high school students from non-educational special districts than regular admissions. Teacher Lee Seong-kwon from Seoul's Daejin High School analyzed \\\"It's really difficult for general high school students from Gangbuk [northern Seoul districts, generally less affluent] regions to pass Seoul National University through regular admissions\\\" and \\\"Comprehensive admissions shows more balanced regional distribution compared to CSAT, which has significant hagwon education influence, by importantly evaluating school records.\\\"\\n\\nBy reporter Jeong Hyeon-jin\\n▷Click here to view larger\\n▷Click here to view larger\\nRelated article▶58% of parents: \\\"Comprehensive admissions not fair\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9549, "output_tokens": 4645, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Study method experts unanimously agree that \\\"vacation is both an opportunity and a turning point.\\\" Students need strategies to analyze their strengths and weaknesses and fill in gaps. We asked three people famous for study method coaching about summer vacation study strategies: Kang Seong-tae, CEO of Gongsin.com; Jo Nam-ho, CEO of StudyCode; and Song Jae-yeol, Leader of Study Revolution Corps. All three did not have outstanding grades when they first entered high school. However, they achieved dramatic grade improvements and were accepted to Seoul National University. We've compiled study strategies drawn from their experiences.\\n\\nKang Seong-tae, CEO of Gongsin.com\\nDon't look at multiple workbooks, solve one until it falls apart\\nThere's hardly any difference in content between workbooks on the market\\nYou must understand perfectly enough to teach it\\nParents should praise 'you can do it' to help overcome limits\\n\\nBeing impatient is a sure way to ruin things. The same goes for studying. When vacation starts, many students get overly enthusiastic and buy loads of workbooks. But a month later, the results are often disappointing. Most cases involve scribbling here and there without properly finishing even one book. It's worth reflecting on the meaning of gwa-yu-bul-geup (過猶不及) - excess is as bad as deficiency. Kang Seong-tae, CEO of Gongsin.com, advises that \\\"greed is forbidden\\\" and \\\"studying requires selection and focus.\\\" He says, \\\"To make selections, you must first discard and empty out unnecessary things,\\\" and advises, \\\"Start by throwing away the workbooks you display proudly on your desk but never actually look at.\\\" \\\"This summer vacation, no more, no less - choose exactly one workbook per subject. Then repeatedly solve that workbook until it falls apart. When vacation ends and the semester begins, you'll gain confidence in studying.\\\"\\n\\n-Students might feel anxious if told to solve only one workbook.\\n\\\"Digesting large quantities gives you a momentary sense of satisfaction. If you stick with just one workbook, you'll have anxious thoughts like 'Is it okay to study so little?' But thinking long-term, this method allows you to digest much more. Even if it seems slow now, speed increases over time. Actually, workbooks on the market have hardly any differences from each other. With CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] having been around for over 20 years, there are established patterns for basic, example, and application problems. There are slight differences in editing and composition between workbooks, but no major differences in problem composition. If you repeatedly solve one book multiple times and perfectly understand one semester's worth of content, you'll gain speed when solving the next workbook. You can finish the next workbook even faster. Properly completing one book gives you the confidence of 'I did it' and creates momentum in studying.\\\"\\n\\n-This seems like advice to focus on understanding.\\n\\\"That's right. Study methods that mechanically increase quantity focus on memorization. It's the approach of 'just solve a lot.' But wrong problems remain wrong, and mistakes repeat. That's because you don't look for reasons why you got them wrong. The study method of properly finishing one book emphasizes understanding. You skim through once to find problems you get wrong, then repeatedly solve them while analyzing why you got them wrong, then solve again to reduce mistakes. Rather than solving new problems each time, it's more efficient to solve the same problems multiple times to make them truly yours. It's good to repeatedly solve one book until you can immediately think of the solution just by looking at the problem.\\\"\\n\\n-Did you have such an experience yourself?\\n\\\"My high school life was a series of feelings of inferiority. I listened to classes earnestly and really tried hard, but my grades always stayed in place. I worked hard but got poor grades, while a friend who always played during class would borrow my notes, study, and get 100 points. I became impatient. I bought more workbooks. In first year, I bought all the workbooks on the market and tried to memorize problems and solutions completely. Then around mid-second year, I seriously reflected on myself. Why weren't my grades improving? What was the problem? I changed my study method to earnestly solving one workbook. I solved one math workbook 10 times. Then I understood the problems. I could see why I was getting them wrong. I finally understood what it meant to understand concepts. From then on, I reduced the number of workbooks for all subjects. I had to write the character 正 (meaning 'correct') twice in front of workbooks to finish one.\\\"\\n\\n-How do you confirm whether you've properly understood concepts?\\n\\\"Try giving a lecture for exactly one hour in front of friends. I mean explain in your own way, using your own language. If you can't figure out how to explain it to others, you haven't properly understood the concept. If your conceptual understanding is too lacking, you don't even need workbooks. Repeat textbooks this vacation. Most students ignore textbooks as being easy, but if you ask them to give a one-hour lecture with a textbook, no student can do it. It means they've understood concepts roughly. After finishing daily study, filling out a blank sheet in your own way is also a good method. Recalling what you studied today and what concepts you learned while organizing once has a good review effect.\\\"\\n\\n-You usually emphasize parents' roles a lot.\\n\\\"Most students with low academic achievement have low self-esteem. Before even trying, they tend to prejudge their own limits, saying things like 'I'm weak in math' or 'I naturally lack linguistic sense.' Parents have a big influence. When I ask such students why they think that way, most answer 'That's what my mom says.' Many parents evaluate their children based on just a few low test scores. From childhood, children hear their mothers say 'You seem weak in math.' There are more negative words like 'No' and 'You can't' than positive words like 'Well done,' 'You can do it,' or 'It's okay.' Then children naturally set limits, thinking 'Oh, I can't do math.'\\\"\\n\\n-What was Representative Kang's mother like?\\n\\\"I attended middle and high school in Ilsan [a suburban area of Seoul]. At that time, Ilsan had non-standardized high school admissions, so you entered based on joint exam scores. I entered the highest-performing high school in the region. I had been 2nd in my class in middle school, but in the class placement test after entering high school, I ranked around 300th out of 330 students. Since only high-performing students were gathered at that school, it was overwhelming to keep up at first. From when I was young, my mother always told me to the point where my ears could have calluses, 'You will become a great person.' Even when I brought home report cards with grades close to last in the school, she always said the same thing. Thanks to my mother's encouragement, I didn't give up.\\\"\\n\\n-What advice would you give to parents?\\n\\\"Finding good hagwons [private academies] and good private tutors, analyzing college admission information instead of the child, and devising strategies are useless if the child lacks motivation to study. Rather than scolding 'Why don't you study?', it's important to instill motivation in the child. Taking a break from studying this vacation is also a method. Send them to volunteer at really difficult and challenging places. Moving your body through hardship and thinking about and experiencing your neighbors' difficulties is also good studying. And I hope you always say positive things to your children like 'Well done' and 'You can do it.' Positivity and praise will become the driving force for children to overcome their own limits.\\\"\\n\\nKang Seong-tae was born in Seoul in 1983, graduated from Ilsan Baekseok High School in 2001, entered Seoul National University's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 2001, started educational volunteer club 'Gongsin' activities in 2006, established learning consulting company 'Gongsin.com' in 2008, and graduated from Seoul National University in 2009. His books include 'God of Study: 1000 Secrets' (2013) and 'You Must Be Crazy to Study' (2015). ※ After entering high school, he scored around 300th out of 330 students in the class placement test. In first year, his school records were mid-level, and his CSAT mock test scores barely made 'in-Seoul [universities in Seoul]' possible. Around mid-second year, he changed his study methods and significantly improved his grades, gaining admission to Seoul National University.\\n\\nJo Nam-ho, CEO of StudyCode\\nDon't open books for a week, if grades don't rise, think about study methods first\\nSeoul National University students focus on understanding, not memorization\\nMake study plans based on quantity, not time\\nStudy methods must vary according to individual characteristics and strengths/weaknesses\\n\\nEducation experts cite 'metacognitive knowledge' as the most important ability in studying. This refers to the ability to accurately identify what you know and don't know when learning something or doing new work, then act accordingly. For example, when grades in a particular subject are poor, it's the ability to find reasons yourself and make and implement plans for overcoming problems. Jo Nam-ho, CEO of StudyCode, advised developing metacognitive knowledge this summer vacation. \\\"It's not important to solve many problems right away,\\\" he said. \\\"As you start this summer vacation, examine your own study methods and find and solve problems.\\\"\\n\\n-You often advise to 'study study methods.'\\n\\\"There's something I really want to tell students as this vacation begins. This might sound absurd, but I want them to close their books for a week. Not studying for a week won't make your grades drop. And take time to carefully reflect on your study methods. Think about whether the studying you've done so far was right, what you lack, and how to fill those gaps. It's not about tackling workbooks, but studying 'study methods.' If you're working hard but your grades are stagnating, there's definitely a problem with yourself first.\\\"\\n\\n-Are you saying that poor studying isn't just a matter of insufficient effort?\\n\\\"Effort is of course the first prerequisite. But effort doesn't directly lead to results. Students now digest tremendous amounts of studying, including school and even hagwons. In terms of study quantity alone, it's the world's best. While taking hagwon classes, everyone thinks 'I'm studying hard.' But the 'quality' of effort differs by student. You need to seriously consider whether you're wearing clothes (study methods) that fit you. Seoul National University students focus on understanding. They make efforts to make it their own. In contrast, students who don't study well pile memorization upon memorization.\\\"\\n\\n-How are Seoul National University students different?\\n\\\"In preparing to start StudyCode, I conducted in-depth interviews with about 3,000 Seoul National University students. You might think Seoul National University students have tremendously high IQs, but the average IQ of those 3,000 Seoul National University students was only 110. They didn't study well because they were born with exceptional brains. The key is intellectual persistence. Specifically, they focus on understanding rather than memorization. Seoul National University students constantly asked 'why' when encountering new concepts and problems. They continuously ask themselves questions like 'Why is this problem solved this way?', 'What's the core of this concept?', and 'I keep getting the same problem wrong, how should I solve it?' If they can't convince themselves with these questions, they don't move to the next stage. They invest tremendous time in understanding one problem. They're almost like 'obsession patients' - when they encounter difficult problems, they persistently work until they solve them with their own strength.\\\"\\n\\n-Are you saying quality is more important than quantity?\\n\\\"That's right. The amount of studying digested per day varies individually. Some students solved only 5 math problems per day, while others solved 30 problems. The speed and method of solving and understanding problems differs by person. There's no clearly unified correct answer for specific study skills like preview and review methods. But whether solving 5 or 30 problems per day, the common factor is that they perfectly understand whatever they planned to study until they completely comprehend it. Seoul National University students showed the characteristic of making study plans based on quantity, not time, when planning. Rather than mechanically planning what to study from what time to what time, they specifically set target quantities like how many pages or problems per day.\\\"\\n\\n-It's impressive that there's no correct answer in study methods.\\n\\\"When people talk about study methods, they often ask questions related to study skills, like how to write error notebooks or what to focus on during review. But since students each have different styles - morning types, evening types, etc. - study methods that fit everyone are like a mirage. What's important is the process of finding study methods that suit you. You can find the best study methods through the process of asking yourself about and pondering study methods that fit you.\\\"\\n\\n-What about yourself?\\n\\\"I really worked hard until second year of high school. But my grades always stayed in place. My scores barely made 'in-Seoul [universities]' possible. Starting the winter break of second year, I seriously wondered why. I closed books for a week. Then I kept following around and asking a friend who did well on CSAT mock tests. 'Why don't you look at that chapter when studying Jeongseok [a math workbook]?' 'You fold your scratch paper in half to write? Should I try that too?' Later, that friend got angry that he couldn't study because of me - I bothered him that much. I kept asking 'why.' Following him around and observing for a week, I could see differences from me. For two years, I had tried to memorize everything unconditionally. I just memorized problems and answers. But that friend would struggle with one problem. From then on, I changed my study methods. I consciously decided 'let's not memorize.' When solving problems and studying concepts, I always asked 'why.'\\\"\\n\\n-Weren't you anxious suddenly changing study methods?\\n\\\"The first three months were really anxious. But I was desperate. If I had worked so hard for two years but results weren't good, I thought there was definitely something wrong. When I changed from memorization to understanding-focused methods, the amount I studied drastically decreased. But after doing that for six months, around the summer break of third year, I got a sense of what CSAT was about. It was a new sensation I had never felt before. Understanding concepts gave me speed. I could digest much more at a much faster pace than when I only memorized. Just running forward looking ahead isn't always the answer. If you stop once and look around, you can see things that weren't visible before. If you seriously doubt yourself, you can see what you lack and what you need to fill going forward.\\\"\\n\\nJo Nam-ho was born in Incheon in 1979, graduated from Seoul Sungsil High School in 1998, entered Seoul National University's Computer Engineering Department in 1998, established learning consulting company 'StudyCode' in 2005, and graduated from Seoul National University in 2008. His books include 'Mom Manager' (2009) and 'StudyCode 3.0' (2015). ※ In first year of high school, his school records were upper-mid level, and CSAT mock test scores barely made 'in-Seoul [universities]' possible. Around winter break of second year, he changed to study methods focusing on understanding rather than memorization, significantly raising his grades and gaining admission to Seoul National University.\\n\\nSong Jae-yeol, Leader of Study Revolution Corps\\nDon't make hagwon pilgrimages, without time for self-study it's a waste of time\\nGrades don't rise with just hagwons and private tutoring\\nYou must have time to study alone\\nDuring vacation, don't nag 'study'\\n\\nSong Jae-yeol, who leads learning consulting company 'Study Revolution Corps,' entered Seoul National University's Archaeology and Art History Department and transferred to Cornell University's Architecture Department as a sophomore. Looking at his career alone, he seems like a model student. But he didn't walk a smooth path. Three turning points changed his life.\\n\\nThe first turning point was during the second semester of first year middle school. After six years of elementary school with no connection to studying, he became class president by chance. Thinking he should be a role model for friends, he began studying earnestly. His rank jumped from 30th-40th out of 60 students in the class to 2nd place. He consistently maintained ranks of 20th-30th school-wide while serving as vice president in second year and president in third year.\\n\\nHowever, when he became head of the cheering squad in second year of high school, he began neglecting studies. His grades, which had been in the upper ranks until first semester of first year high school, fell to 22nd out of 50 students. \\\"When grades fell, I disliked studying even more. Once I consistently marked '4' on a German test and got 20 points. Going from model student to problem child happened in an instant.\\\"\\n\\nWhat made him want to study again was his homeroom teacher in second semester of second year high school. Though a first-year teacher, he showed special interest in Song, who was active and had good relationships with friends despite poor grades. He even bought dinner at family restaurants after school. The homeroom teacher told him, \\\"It would be a waste to throw away what you studied before, so how about starting again?\\\" It was sincere affection and interest, not nagging.\\n\\n-Did you actually study hard again?\\n\\\"Yes. The more the teacher was good to me, the more sorry I felt. I wanted to repay that feeling. It was a moment when I realized that the power to make students sit at desks isn't nagging to 'study' but heartfelt encouragement and love.\\\"\\n\\n-Did your grades improve easily?\\n\\\"During winter break of second year, thanks to efforts going around hagwons, my first mock test score in third year improved by 100 points. From 220 to 320 points out of 400. I received 15 types of hagwon education including hagwons and private tutoring throughout the break.\\\"\\n\\n-Did your parents have high educational enthusiasm?\\n\\\"My mother had a longing for Seoul National University. She said that seeing the son of a family she briefly stayed with get accepted to Seoul National University made her think, 'If I have a son later, I should send him to Seoul National University.' In fifth grade elementary school, I first received tutoring from a Seoul National University student.\\\"\\n\\n-Did hagwon education help?\\n\\\"Looking only at results, it failed. My first mock test score in third year remained my CSAT score. Since I had started preparing for CSAT in earnest from winter of second year, I had regrets. I knelt before my mother and asked for one more chance. When repeating, I attended hagwons even more diligently than in third year. But a year later, results weren't much different. I couldn't surpass the top 20% threshold.\\\"\\n\\n-What did you think was the problem?\\n\\\"The problem was attending hagwons and receiving private tutoring. I only attended hagwons and only received private tutoring. There was no process of self-directed learning to make that knowledge my own after taking classes. Now there's high interest in self-directed learning, but 15 years ago, that concept didn't exist. I desperately realized the importance of self-directed learning while repeating for the third time. This was my life's third turning point.\\\"\\n\\n-Was this the motivation for starting the learning consulting business?\\n\\\"That's right. When I studied alone while repeating for the third time, my CSAT scores were in the top 0.6% nationally. I was accepted to Seoul National University and fulfilled my mother's wish. After that, I wanted to help students who waste time like I did. Hagwon education can be effective when there are subjects or chapters you can't understand through school classes alone. But students attending hagwons without knowing what they lack is a waste of time. Also, mistaking attending hagwons as 'studying' is a problem. This is where the biggest difference between students who study well and those who don't emerges. Excellent students always have time to study alone even when receiving hagwon education, but students with poor grades only attend hagwons. According to one research result, brain waves when taking classes and when studying alone are different. Brain waves when taking classes at school or hagwons are similar to when watching movies. Students who only attend hagwons are just watching learning videos day and night.\\\"\\n\\n-What effective subject-specific study methods would you recommend for mid-to-lower level students?\\n\\\"For math, you should choose one textbook per subject and solve it at least three times. This means repeating until there's not a single problem you can't solve within one workbook. You can identify which chapters are weak and supplement lacking areas. I recommend trying it once during vacation, even if skeptically. By the time school starts, you'll discover yourself with confidence in math. For English, you should focus on memorizing sentences rather than studying grammar. Open past exam problems or mock tests and memorize just 20-30 passages per day. At first, it's fine to do it while looking at translations. What's important is consistently repeating daily. You can naturally learn sentence structures and vocabulary. In just one month, 600-900 sentences accumulate in your head. If you do this for a year, there won't be problems you can't answer on CSAT. For Korean, using past exam problems is also good. After reading passages, training to summarize content by paragraph can develop not only reading comprehension but also thinking and logical abilities to distinguish correct and incorrect answers on CSAT.\\\"\\n\\n-What would you advise parents?\\n\\\"I hope that during summer vacation only, you won't nag your children to 'study.' Don't bring up topics related to 'studying' at all. Taking good care of delicious food and asking if there are problems with friend relationships is sufficient. Nagging only provokes rebellious feelings in children. When mothers stop nagging, children realize they must take responsibility for their own lives. I've seen many students sit at desks out of anxiety.\\\"\\n\\nSong Jae-yeol was born in Boseong, South Jeolla Province in 1980, graduated from Seoul Baemyeong High School in 1999, entered Seoul National University's Archaeology and Art History Department in 2001 (dropped out), started study method lectures at SkyEdu in 2003, transferred to Cornell University's Architecture Department in 2006 (currently on leave), established learning consulting company 'Test Master Study Method Research Institute' in 2009, and changed the company name to 'Study Revolution Corps' in 2014.

Please introduce yourselves.\\nGold Spoon IV Mom (hereinafter IV Mom): Hello, I'm Gold Spoon IV Mom.\\nSuper Energetic Mom (hereinafter Energetic Mom): Hello, I'm Super Energetic Mom.\\nHyochang-dong Virtuous Wife and Mother (hereinafter Virtuous Wife): Hello, Hyochang-dong Virtuous Wife and Mother is back again.\\nNakseongdae Alice (hereinafter Alice): Hello, I'm Nakseongdae Alice.\\nPyeongchon Easy Mom (hereinafter Easy Mom): Hello, I'm Pyeongchon Easy Mom.\\nChae In-taek: Yes. We have some very lively people here as always. Today, these lively people need to speak very sharply and go beyond lively to speak very candidly about our topic. That topic is career-interrupted women. We'll discuss this under the title 'Career-Interrupted Women's Resumes.' Looking at the current situation, there are many women whose careers have been interrupted due to childbirth and childcare rather than other reasons. Because of this, they're seeking new lives or giving up their careers up to that point, and various situations are unfolding. The government has created employment support systems for career-interrupted women, and the appeals of career-interrupted women frequently appear in newspapers and broadcasts. What are the career backgrounds of those attending today? Let me hear how secure your careers are.\\n\\nEasy Mom: I'm Pyeongchon Easy Mom. In my case, I got married at thirty-two, but I think I made the choice whether to marry or not in my mid-twenties. So my case isn't one of complete career interruption but career reduction - a case where I voluntarily chose to reduce it. After finishing university, I joined a major corporation and worked from early morning to evening, even into the night.\\n\\nChae In-taek: So it wasn't 9-to-5 but 5-to-11 or something like that?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Yes, something similar. While living like that, I thought: 'Living this way, can I get married? Can I have children?' I had to make a choice. After working for about 1-2 years, I thought 'This isn't the life I want' and 'Since I'm someone who will get married someday, I shouldn't continue this way,' so I voluntarily resigned and pursued academic studies.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, the reason you resigned was that in that kind of lifestyle, it would be difficult to get married, have children, and live the life you wanted?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Yes, impossible.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, even impossible?\\n\\nEasy Mom: I think it's impossible. And at that time, it was the first atmosphere where they were hiring many female college graduates in large numbers. In that atmosphere, I absolutely couldn't slack off at work or cut corners, and because of my school background, the company's expectations of me were very high. So after much deliberation, I left. While making tearful efforts to sustain my career and prevent it from being interrupted, I've been living with truly heartbreaking efforts.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You're talking about a new career, right? Newly entering graduate school, getting married, having a baby, and building a career while juggling studies and childcare. You're currently working as a part-time lecturer, right?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Yes.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: But last time you said you decided on your major at 15, and now in your mid-twenties you're looking ahead 10 years again... Your foresight is amazing. I find this somewhat annoying. Something's annoying about it (haha).\\n\\nChae In-taek: You say you want to live a planned life, but even when living with plans, such huge obstacles always appear outside of those plans.\\n\\nEasy Mom: I want to live easily.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: The destination is similar.\\n\\nEasy Mom: I plan to live easily, but it turns out to be the same thing.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You planned to live easily, but the conclusion is that you end up living very hard. Die hard.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: You say 'easy,' but whether it's actually easy is questionable.\\n\\nAlice: Compared to Easy Mom, I lived very normally, really ordinarily. After graduating from undergraduate studies, I just entered a major corporation like any ordinary person because I was lucky at that time. After joining the corporation and seeing how the senior staff lived, I felt a lot of doubt. They suggested I resign, but when I didn't, they moved my desk in front of the tea room. After experiencing that, I resigned and thought 'Ah, studying is my path after all,' so I did my master's degree. After doing the master's, I realized 'To study in Korea, you need money,' so I needed that money and to continue studying, so I entered a public institution and worked while passing my doctoral program. But according to graduate school regulations, I had to be a full-time student, so I resigned from the public institution and started my doctorate.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: What a waste.\\n\\nEasy Mom: That good public institution job.\\n\\nChae In-taek: So you quit that good public institution job and entered the academic path?\\n\\nAlice: Yes. Just like an ordinary person studying at school.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Well, it doesn't seem very ordinary. What kind of values were at work in between?\\n\\nAlice: It was really an ordinary value system. I really wanted to maintain my studies as something to make a living with, as my profession.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You wanted to study? You thought it would be good for studying to be your profession?\\n\\nAlice: Because the public institution, compared to regular corporations or general companies, would send you to evening graduate school or let you use vacation days a bit more easily - not like civil servants, but the atmosphere allowed easier use of vacation days, so I entered the public institution. So I thought I could do my doctorate in that way too, but I learned about the school regulations too late, so I had to resign.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Seoul National University [Korea's most prestigious university] made a regulation a few years ago that doctoral students must attend full-time for their first two semesters, right?\\n\\nAlice: Yes. That seems to have been created so students could focus on their studies.\\n\\nChae In-taek: It has pros and cons, but for Alice Mom, it could be a damaging turning point.\\n\\nAlice: Yes. So actually, after admission, I took a year off. I felt guilty about potentially taking away someone else's opportunity.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You took a leave and continued at the public enterprise?\\n\\nAlice: Yes. Because I needed to save some money. So I saved money and worked until resignation anyway. I just worked without rest. I got pregnant at 35 and gave birth at 36. Until then, I normally came to graduate school, did projects, and studied. I had been building my career very ordinarily like that, but after getting pregnant, I wasn't doing anything particularly strenuous - just doing projects and research like ordinary graduate students. But I hadn't taken care of my body before, and generally using public transportation - it takes 2 hours round trip from Seoul to my workplace. This isn't special to me; it's generally like that. Graduate students are the same, but we usually finish around 11-12 PM when we have work to do.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Oh, when you're attending graduate school and doing projects, you finish at 11 PM?\\n\\nAlice: Yes. It's not just me.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Not AM, right? PM 11, 12. Ah yes.\\n\\nAlice: I think fatigue accumulated. So in mid-pregnancy, around 20 weeks - about halfway through - I had so much bleeding that I had to stop all work and come home. And after giving birth...\\n\\nEasy Mom: That's when involuntary career interruption began.\\n\\nChae In-taek: When you started studying, quitting your previous job was a voluntary choice, but as you were adapting to that life of studying and doing projects, you got pregnant, and at 20 weeks, due to bleeding and fatigue, you couldn't bear it anymore, so you involuntarily had to stop graduate school projects and just focus on caring for your body?\\n\\nAlice: Yes. It's probably not just me - anyone who attended graduate school in Korea... Because graduate school isn't like a job where someone looks after you or sets your schedule, and it's not something absolute but something you do yourself, everyone probably accepts it that way.\\n\\nChae In-taek: People outside think studying life must be so rewarding, comfortable, and enjoyable. But inside the cage, there are tremendous dealings and problems, and especially having and raising a baby while living graduate school life is indeed as problematic and difficult as having a job?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Maybe even more than a job.\\n\\nAlice: More than a job. Because people too easily say, 'Since you're studying, you don't have to work for a moment, right?'\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, when you have a job, people say 'Work must be hard, so rest and look after the baby,' but when you're studying, people demand why you can't do that. Ah, this will be an important point.\\n\\nIV Mom: Yes. And you're not even earning money.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, not earning money while... Ah, social perception.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: In Korea, people really undervalue those who can't take care of themselves (IV Mom: who spend money while) not earning their keep.\\n\\nChae In-taek: When you earn money, 'How hard you must work to earn money.'\\n\\nIV Mom: 'You spend money, so why are you acting like that?'\\n\\nChae In-taek: 'What's so hard about studying and spending money?'\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: 'Are you showing off?'\\n\\nChae In-taek: But Alice Mom, you've experienced both working and graduate school life - studying and doing projects. Honestly, there are various cases so horizontal comparison might not work, but based on your experience, how would you compare the two?\\n\\nAlice: Um, whether you gain freedom of body or freedom of mind, freedom of spirit.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Freedom of spirit and freedom of body.\\n\\nAlice: For me it was like this. When working, I had no soul but could move according to that schedule - especially since my last job was at a public institution. Even if you don't focus your mind on that work, that's a characteristic of bureaucracy. It doesn't collapse greatly if one person is missing. But since I couldn't do anything according to my will, there was resulting... how should I put it, powerlessness? Many people don't feel this, but I felt powerless. So I started studying, but after studying, I feel powerless in economic situations. Because at the last public institution I worked at, my take-home pay exceeded 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] annually. That was my take-home pay because I had some seniority. But after entering the doctoral program, the maximum pre-tax amount I could receive from doing the most projects - not take-home but pre-tax - was 2.5 million won [approximately $1,900 USD].\\n\\nEasy Mom: If you received that much from school, you did an enormous amount of work.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Pre-tax 30 million [won]. Working until eleven PM.\\n\\nAlice: I was legendary. I was the legend who received 2.5 million won. If you do that, in a month...\\n\\nChae In-taek: To become a legend, you have to work until midnight?\\n\\nAlice: Work until midnight, pull all-nighters 3-4 times a month, and have no weekends.\\n\\nChae In-taek: No weekends?\\n\\nAlice: Yes, that's right.\\n\\nChae In-taek: As a student?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Oh my, not a student.\\n\\nAlice: And when year-end reports pile up, you should expect not to go home for about a week.\\n\\nChae In-taek: What about the baby?\\n\\nAlice: That was before pregnancy.\\n\\nChae In-taek: When you were doing projects before pregnancy?\\n\\nAlice: Probably people who have had children and are working at school now just leave their children completely at home and only do school work. That's what you have to do - that's the reality for graduate students in Korea.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Just like people who work regular jobs, they have to leave their children completely at daycare centers or with parents from either side (though that would be difficult with in-laws), and they themselves have to come to school and do projects like going to work.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Otherwise, you can't proceed with your studies. For classes, many graduate school classes are offered in the evening.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, evening classes are quite helpful for non-full-time students, but for full-time students, especially student moms juggling childcare, it could be a very difficult situation.\\n\\nEasy Mom: And lab meetings on Saturdays or weekend workshops are very common.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Laboratory, research lab meetings are often on weekends rather than weekdays. Why weekends? Because of professors' schedules?\\n\\nEasy Mom: During weekdays, there are lectures and other classes.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Because everyone's busy?\\n\\nEasy Mom: It's also difficult to gather everyone.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: My husband did his doctorate in science and engineering, and lab meetings were Saturday mornings. So I asked 'Why Saturday morning lab meetings?' He said 'The supervising professor feels good seeing students research on Saturday mornings. He did the same during his doctoral studies, so he calls them on Saturdays to encourage diligent study.'\\n\\nEasy Mom: Saturday morning is universal.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, this isn't something just one or two people experienced. You're saying it's not a special case but a universal situation.\\n\\nAlice: It's a universal situation. And although students are now considered dual-career couples, when I put my child on daycare waiting lists, we weren't considered dual-career. So I had no family support from either side and put my child on the waiting list for national public daycare centers. Even when I used loopholes and registered us as dual-career, the wait was so long. My husband and I directly visited private and home daycare centers to see their conditions. Then he said his heart was too uncomfortable to leave the child at such places, even though he wouldn't be the one watching the child. So when there's no place to leave the child and he says his heart is too uncomfortable...\\n\\nEasy Mom: Give up your career.\\n\\nAlice: If we're not getting divorced, I can't send the child according to my wishes.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Goodness, between spouses there can be cracks or tensions... There weren't any, right?\\n\\nAlice: Right. So that didn't work out either. For babysitters, even though our house has much more debt than assets, it gets counted as assets.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Are you house poor?\\n\\nAlice: It's a long story, but because it gets counted as assets, we don't qualify for government support. We'd have to pay for babysitters almost entirely out of pocket.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, when counted as assets, it doesn't matter whether you borrowed money, inherited it, or originally had it. It depends entirely on the scale of assets.\\n\\nAlice: Yes. So with our household loan payments alone making life tight, and looking at my appearance, you can tell I barely managed to put on lotion before coming out.\\n\\nChae In-taek: This is a podcast, so we can't see.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: That's why you appeared on this show?\\n\\nAlice: Yes, that's why I confidently came out.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you can't appear on video?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: There are some people like that here too.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You're too modest.\\n\\nAlice: Yes. So inevitably, I came home in September 2013, gave birth in March 2014, and finally this March 2016, my child enters daycare. I was a full-time housewife for 2 years and 6 months.\\n\\nChae In-taek: So for 2 years and 6 months, you were a full-time housewife at home after giving birth?\\n\\nAlice: That's right.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Involuntarily career-interrupted.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Until the child could go to daycare, your career was interrupted for 2 years and 6 months - there might be voluntary job interruption, but your academic and research career from graduate school was also interrupted.\\n\\nAlice: That's right. The professor contacted me until last spring, but it's been a year now since he stopped contacting me. But I'm in a frustrating situation because I need to show the professor again that I'm prepared to this extent.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: You probably can't even think about a second child.\\n\\nAlice: I think I should have the second child after receiving my doctorate.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Then you'd be an advanced maternal age, geriatric pregnancy.\\n\\nChae In-taek: I have nothing to say.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Actually, thinking about the situation when I briefly mentioned earlier - I think my career wasn't interrupted, but thinking about that situation brings tears to my eyes. Because I was a lecturer, if I had a baby during the semester, I would lose my teaching job. So I planned my pregnancy at the hospital to match the dates.\\n\\nChae In-taek: To give birth during vacation?\\n\\nEasy Mom: Yes. So there's only one opportunity every 6 months. (Oh my, what to do.) So after getting pregnant like that and giving birth just one week after vacation started, I returned to teaching after 45 days. Really, thinking about that time brings tears to my eyes.\\n\\nChae In-taek: This is shocking - something that requires studying biology, physiology, developmental science, and various other disciplines. Virtuous Wife, how is your career situation and how are you maintaining it now?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: I keep hearing 'virtuous wife and mother.'\\n\\nChae In-taek: The term 'virtuous wife and mother' itself isn't about career interruption but career abandonment, right? That's not your case, is it? You have the will to continue and maintain your career?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: I have the will. I have the will, but to be a virtuous wife and mother of course... I'm actually worried I might become a real virtuous wife and mother. I keep hearing it lately. But what should I say... I also worked at a public institution. From after having my first child until before getting pregnant with my second child.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Ah, why are all these accomplished people in this situation?\\n\\nChae In-taek: You should be going to work now, but you're doing Mom's Talk.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: But I couldn't do it all together. I had to earn money, live life, raise children, and study. My graduate school grades were all B-minus, and I was taking out student loans for graduate school. When salary comes in from work, it all goes to living expenses and nothing accumulates. You end up spending as much as you earn. Why are there so many congratulatory and funeral events? So I quit my job thinking 'I'll dedicate myself to study instead,' and I dedicated myself to study, but I couldn't get into research projects. Because there are young students who can devote their time and be mobilized anytime, while students like me with children don't get opportunities. Those young students get into research projects, not people like me. Even when I applied, I didn't get selected.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Is the internal logic 'We should give opportunities to young people because they're economically struggling too. Older people who came later might have worked other jobs and saved money'? Is that how they see it?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: It would be easy to think that way.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Is that the reality?\\n\\nAlice: Especially for married women, there's the thinking that since husbands work and earn money, 'At least one person is earning, right?'\\n\\nChae In-taek: Since one family member is earning, it would be good for you to yield a little. Something like that?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Yes. But actually, when there are gaps of several years in our careers on resumes, there's no way to fill that. So I chose a kind of startup. Actually, I didn't start a business or company, but I began organizing civic society groups. Since my major is social welfare, I saw that the learning rights, human rights, and maternal rights of mother graduate students were in such blind spots of the system, so I created and organized groups about these issues and began making policy proposals.\\n\\nEasy Mom: But you did work, but you didn't receive money or belong to an organization, right?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: No monthly salary at all. If I did research projects, I donated all my labor costs to Mom in SNU [a support group for mother students at Seoul National University], so I couldn't receive a salary for the past 4 years. So my husband said just one thing: 'It's fine to go out and work, but bring home some money.'\\n\\nChae In-taek: Really a desperate double, triple burden...\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: So in the power relationship with my husband, I lost all the advantage I gained from producing two sons by not earning money and being dependent on my husband for food. So I barely maintained my resume career through volunteer work.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You maintained your resume career through volunteer work?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: I organized groups and worked as a representative, contributed to women's civic society and student parent human rights, continued legislative and policy proposal activities through this. Writing research reports, policy proposals, requesting legislation. So actually last February, the Parent Student Act passed in the 19th National Assembly. So as Alice Mom mentioned, parent students now get priority in daycare waiting lists by being recognized as dual-career. I've been doing such activities, but my living standard was basically at the basic livelihood recipient level during that time.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You said 'I sustained my career through volunteer work,' but from a third party's perspective, and from your husband's viewpoint, since your cash supply capacity is almost zero, some people might see this as doing nothing. Your husband might especially strongly think that no career has been extended?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: That's not just thinking - he says it out loud. A Seoul National University master's graduate is living off someone else's food.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You should prepare boxing gloves or massage equipment at home. Ah, you should prepare that thing you put in your ears?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Earplugs?\\n\\nChae In-taek: Earplugs so you can pretend not to know even if you yell at each other.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Ah, I... they're called earplugs.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Earplugs. You understand perfectly even when I speak unclearly. I gave birth to two sons.\\n\\nEasy Mom: No, please get it right.\\n\\nChae In-taek: You absolutely can't let it slide (Easy Mom).\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: After two C-sections, my brain became like this.\\n\\nChae In-taek: What was the situation before doing this?\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: I was elegant and intelligent.\\n\\nChae In-taek: That's certainly a good excuse, but the passage of time comes to us too, regardless of C-sections. So what story does our Super Energetic Mom have?\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: I was preparing to study something different while attending undergraduate school. But I decided to get married in my early twenties during that preparation. So I thought 'I'll get married and then study' and married in my early twenties. I calculated that I'd have a hard time until about 40 but prepared myself and got married after crunching the numbers about time. But I hadn't planned on children. I'm really the opposite of Easy Mom - I couldn't plan at all. Everyone had known since I was young that I wouldn't get married, and I had said this publicly from a very young age, but I got married in my early twenties and had two children in succession.\\n\\nIV Mom: People like that usually go early.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: Yes. So I was surprised, and even my high school teacher came to the wedding.\\n\\nEasy Mom: I quit my job to get married but got married after turning thirty.\\n\\nIV Mom: That's how it usually goes.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: So I became a mother in my early twenties. To do new studies, I had to re-enter university. I was waiting for the right time, but that was just my thinking - other people were like 'You got married and had children, haven't you achieved everything?' That was basically their attitude. But that wasn't the case for me, so I wanted to study, but when I tried to study what I wanted, many people said 'It would be good to go study at a lifelong education center.' I'm not trying to disparage that - there are many really good educational institutions. I actually looked into it. But the field I wanted to study required more education. So I decided 'Let me take CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] again' and started preparing for entrance exams from when our second child was past 15 months, around the second birthday.\\n\\nEasy Mom: How old were you then?\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: I was twenty-seven or twenty-eight. So from then on I prepared, but what I wanted to study wasn't just studying - I had to do practical skills too. So I took CSAT through internet lectures and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] is free. I did practical skills day and night, took CSAT, took the exam again, and entered university again. But I heard there are such cases abroad - entering late. There are many cases and even universities you can attend when you're older. But Korea doesn't have that. I had no support or anything, and since everyone around opposed it, only my husband and I thought about this. We broke all our savings and children's insurance to study. But if you fail, you're nothing - it's complete gambling. So I did it! I studied and fortunately, thankfully, got admitted. But after admission, I took a 3-year break because my child got sick and I had to nurse the child. But this was entirely dependent on me. Other people don't think it's important when you're studying, and they don't even consider it career interruption.\\n\\nEasy Mom: And at that time, there were no childcare leaves or anything for children's illnesses, so it must have been very difficult.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: And my position was as an undergraduate student. It's not a normal situation at all. Graduate students or doctoral students usually do that, but undergraduates getting married - that's usually when they made an unintended mistake when young. And it somewhat interferes with studies too. But anyway, if those are external difficulties, from my personal standpoint, I'm continuing to create my career by breaking through that and continuing to study while studying.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: So this seems like you're a career pioneer who tremendously overcame personal and social limitations.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: Nice words. (haha)\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: In Korea, becoming like that is almost like being a legendary figure. But when I went to UC Berkeley and visited the parent student center, there were many undergraduate parent students there. So I was talking with the center director, and in this country, there are many people who transfer to UC Berkeley through community college, or who come back to the state university after being discharged from the military and become parents. So there are many parents there. It's a good school. But there are second chances, second opportunities like this. It's not that if you fail college entrance once, you live as a life loser, but there are opportunities and systems to continuously challenge throughout your life cycle. But in Korea, that's very limited, and especially coming to prestigious universities again is institutionally almost non-existent.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Almost non-existent.\\n\\nEnergetic Mom: So cases like me seem rare in school too. Entering after having two children. So my positioning doesn't work, and the school's doesn't work either - it's kind of ambiguous.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: I was like that too. Coming through independent study degree [a system allowing self-directed learning toward a degree], it was ambiguous.\\n\\nChae In-taek: I see. Now, self-proclaimed Gold Spoon IV Mom, is your career interruption voluntary, involuntary, due to childbirth and childcare, or a choice for your own upgrade? Let me hear your story.\\n\\nIV Mom: I'm not sure how to categorize it either. I also got married quite early. I got married in my senior year of university. I was preparing for employment thinking 'I should get a job after marriage,' but I was pregnant. Then you can't do interviews or training with a big belly as a pregnant woman. Suddenly I went from being a job seeker to a pregnant woman. So I thought 'Then I'll have to postpone employment for a while' and gave birth.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Being pregnant became a kind of status that indicates not just personal condition but social position. So you can't even interview, and if you submit applications, they'd say 'Why did you come in this condition?' We don't usually think like that - we think workplaces are places where unmarried, non-pregnant men and women apply, but there are actually many cases like this, right?\\n\\nIV Mom: Because they can't understand a pregnant woman coming to an interview.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Did you not try at all?\\n\\nIV Mom: So I tried, but pushing myself caused problems with the child's health too, and...\\n\\nEasy Mom: Even if you succeed, it's worrying.\\n\\nIV Mom: Even if I succeeded, suddenly entering and receiving training, then having to say I'm going to give birth...\\n\\nEasy Mom: And training often involves a lot of physical training and such.\\n\\nIV Mom: You can't run with a big belly.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Do you run during training?\\n\\nAlice, Easy Mom: There are team-building activities like building towers. And overnight mountain climbing, 1 night 2 days, things like that.\\n\\nIV Mom: When I calculated, it didn't work out. So I thought I should give birth quickly and get employed quickly. So I gave birth and tried, but I hadn't planned anything about pregnancy.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Ah, you gave birth quickly to get employed quickly?\\n\\nIV Mom: With that mindset, 'diligently, diligently.' So during pregnancy I studied English, took English tests with a big belly. 'Once the baby comes out, I'll get employed immediately.'\\n\\nEasy Mom: Pregnant job seeker.\\n\\nIV Mom: A pregnant lady appearing at TEPS [Test of English Proficiency developed by Seoul National University] test sites.\\n\\nChae In-taek: We should have met then - I can't really imagine what situation that would be. What difficulties were there?\\n\\nIV Mom: After taking all the tests and getting all the scores and giving birth, oh my, that wasn't the end. I had no plans for anything. So thinking 'Oh my, what is this?' I started childcare. I couldn't sleep at night because of breastfeeding. Waking up every 2-3 hours, crying that if I could just sleep 5 hours I'd have no other wish. Living a life that violates human rights for so long, I gradually lost my grip. Meanwhile, the baby got sick early on, and dealing with all that made me even more delayed. I graduated from a good undergraduate school with excellent grades.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: Didn't you graduate valedictorian this time?\\n\\nEnergetic Mom, Easy Mom: Graduate school valedictorian.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Is there valedictorian for graduate school?\\n\\nEnergetic Mom, Easy Mom: Yes, there is. Then you must attend graduation to receive the award.\\n\\nIV Mom: I didn't even know that and said 'Ah, I can't come that day because I'm busy with part-time work, job preparation, and watching my child,' but they said 'What are you saying?' and that I must come.\\n\\nVirtuous Wife: What part-time work do you do? Sell one of your gold spoons.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Sell one of your gold spoons.\\n\\nEasy Mom: Still, you have to pay property taxes.\\n\\nChae In-taek: Paying taxes must be difficult too.\\n\\nIV Mom: Anyway, people have to figure out their own living somehow. As human beings.

I'm Good Wife and Wise Mother, the pride of Hyochangdong.\\nEveryone: (haha)\\nChae In-taek: The moment you all say your nicknames, laughter bursts out.\\nGood Wife: No, it's not that. The elderly people in our neighborhood like me.\\nChae In-taek: We have five people here, what about the other two?\\nSuper Strong Mom (hereafter Strong Mom): I'm Super Strong Mom.\\nChae In-taek: Yes, I can picture what kind of image that is.\\nGold Spoon IV Mom (hereafter IV Mom): I'm Gold Spoon IV Mom.\\nChae In-taek: You're a gold spoon but you're on an IV, so pure and pitiful, weak, what kind of minor ailments?\\nIV Mom: Close to weak.\\nChae In-taek: Infinitely close to weak... Ah, should I understand this as a name that reflects the reality where children are healthy but mothers raising children become infinitely weak?\\nIV Mom: Yes. (haha)\\nChae In-taek: Oh, you're answering very vigorously.\\nIV Mom: Yes, that's right!\\nChae In-taek: As expected, when stories about overcoming low birth rates come up, voices get higher in this kind of atmosphere.\\nGood Wife: It has to be that way.\\nIV Mom: I powered up a bit before coming today.\\nGood Wife: You had a brief moment of energy.\\nChae In-taek: I'll think that your power went up with strong charging. Today's topic is immigration. It could be an exodus. A country good for raising children, a country good for working while raising children, a country with evenings, a country where the whole family can comfortably talk about the future - our country is lacking in these areas. So it's Hell Joseon [a derogatory term comparing modern Korea to the restrictive Joseon Dynasty]. There are even such words. Then wouldn't it be better to escape and go somewhere else? Many people make such extreme arguments. Do any of you have such thoughts?\\nAlice: Yes, I seriously thought about it.\\nChae In-taek: Nakseongdae Alice, did you seriously think about it?\\nAlice: I seriously did. With my husband. Because I had done Nepal-related projects for about 4 years before.\\nChae In-taek: Nepal?\\nAlice: Yes. I did Nepal-related projects for about 4 years.\\nChae In-taek: What kind of Nepal work did you do?\\nAlice: If I talk specifically, my advisor professor would probably know.\\nChae In-taek: Was it about quality of life in Nepal?\\nAlice: Related to quality of life improvement.\\nChae In-taek: It wouldn't be about Nepal's defense capabilities. Ah, you must have been attracted to it while working on quality of life?\\nAlice: Rather than being attracted to the culture there, I was attracted to the lives of Korean residents there after going and meeting local conditions and local Koreans.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, not locals but the lives of Koreans?\\nAlice: Koreans living there.\\nChae In-taek: How did they live?\\nAlice: First of all, prices were so unrealistically cheap. So even though we don't have much now, even if I received the maximum of 2.5 million won [approximately $1,900 USD] during my doctoral program, I would be upper class there.\\nChae In-taek: Living luxuriously?\\nAlice: Yes, living luxuriously. My husband wouldn't even need to work.\\nChae In-taek: If he doesn't work, he can be put to other tasks?\\nAlice: Just me alone would be enough.\\nChae In-taek: Chopping firewood, being a shutter man?\\nAlice: Ah, I wouldn't even expect him to work as a shutter man. He could just lie at home.\\nChae In-taek: I'll take that as \\\"I'd be satisfied as long as he doesn't work overtime and doesn't come home after midnight.\\\"\\nAlice: Yes, prices were that cheap. Also, on the other hand, Chinese pesticides were very expensive for those people, so pesticide-free local food was common.\\nEveryone: Hahaha.\\nChae In-taek: This is eco-friendly and pesticide-free, but the reason is that they don't use it because even cheap Chinese products are too expensive economically. Ah, that's quite a paradox.\\nAlice: There were many local, fresh, safe vegetables. Live-in housekeepers also, at that time - though it was only a few years ago - anyway about 5 years ago, for 200,000-300,000 won [approximately $150-230 USD] they would live in and do everything.\\nChae In-taek: Compared to Korean prices, almost one-tenth?\\nIV Mom: That kind of price. Moreover, surprisingly, there were many places where English communication was possible. Also, as a Korean, even if I didn't use my major there, there were many NGO opportunities, but with small skills like baking or beauty services - of course there would be a long adaptation period due to local water and local flour conditions - but if you adapted to even that, you could generate some income with such skills, not necessarily living luxuriously. Korean dramas were becoming popular there, so the image of Koreans was quite good due to the Korean Wave.\\nChae In-taek: There's the Korean Wave and no bad image of Koreans yet, continuing to be a good image?\\nAlice: There were people who wanted to study Korean, so you could teach Korean if you wanted to.\\nEasy Mom: Isn't Nepali similar to Korean?\\nAlice: They say the word order is exactly the same.\\nChae In-taek: English speakers in the global generation, young people, can make basic living by teaching English anywhere in the world. Just traveling abroad for a few years while young, or some people live their whole lives that way. There are countries where you can teach Korean and make a living, and that's Nepal.\\nAlice: Yes.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, there are such good opportunities, so what would you do if you went there?\\nAlice: In my case, there were quite many things I could do. I had received offers from NGOs too. So I could do that. In my husband's case, since he works in logistics and trade, he could go anywhere abroad. Actually, at that time, though he's now in private business, his first company recommended him to go as a resident representative to India. My husband was also willing. These things became more focused when I went through pregnancy and childbirth - if we go to Nepal or India, since we're foreigners, we can send our child to international schools.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, I see.\\nAlice: We can send them to international schools.\\nChae In-taek: What about the price?\\nAlice: Much cheaper. Compared to sending our child to international schools in our country, it's much cheaper.\\nChae In-taek: How about compared to sending them to regular schools here and adding hagwon education?\\nAlice: Cheaper than that too. There, English is basic and I can handle Korean, so Korean and even the local language. Moreover, when they graduate and go to university, depending on what their parents do, admission to universities in the US, UK, or Europe is easier. That's what I observed. And if they want domestic university admission, they can just get hagwon education anyway, so it would be much better.\\nChae In-taek: They can get hagwon education anyway? What about people who can't afford it?\\nEasy Mom: And there's the overseas Korean admission track.\\nChae In-taek: You mean the qualifications become more advantageous anyway?\\nAlice: So educationally, it seemed so much more advantageous. Moreover, since I was targeting developing countries, I would be freer from racial discrimination. So I seriously asked until recently, 'Should we really go?' We talked about this a lot.\\nChae In-taek: If you go there, the burden of childcare would be much less than in Korea, and children would play much more happily than in Korea, and parents would see their children's faces brighten up. Did you think like that?\\nAlice: If we go there, we could have a second child.\\nStrong Mom: A third one too.\\nEasy Mom: A fourth one too.\\nGood Wife: Breathing Himalayan clean air, what couldn't you do?\\nAlice: I thought about it quite a lot. Of course, we're hesitant now due to earthquake issues.\\nChae In-taek: What's the reason for hesitation?\\nAlice: Earthquakes. Natural disasters.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, Nepal earthquakes. Not everything can be perfect.\\nEasy Mom: The air in Kathmandu is bad.\\nAlice: Setting aside whether it's safe from natural disasters, I seriously considered it a lot.\\nChae In-taek: What about the others?\\nGood Wife: My husband has a green card. A US green card. My mother-in-law is now a citizen, and her siblings all live in the US. So my husband ran away to the US when his doctoral program got tough, and what did he do there? He got a bunch of certifications. My husband studies very well.\\nEasy Mom: Certification killer.\\nChae In-taek: Even certification studies!\\nGood Wife: He only studies well. (haha) So.\\nChae In-taek: Ah, let's keep that as a family secret.\\nGood Wife: Yes, since real names won't be revealed. So he got many certifications.\\nStrong Mom: American certifications?\\nGood Wife: Right. Like architect?\\nEasy Mom: Not architect.\\nGood Wife: Construction supervisor? Real estate too. Each state has different ones, and he got them. So what happens is, just by signing with one of these certifications, he can make enough to live on per month - that's what we heard in the Korean community. But our family has some moral perfectionism. So if he did that, \\\"How can I, with my conscience,\\\" \\\"With my scholarly conscience,\\\" he brought hardship upon himself.\\nChae In-taek: He thinks of himself as a scholar.\\nGood Wife: He got his doctorate. He's a scholar anyway.\\nChae In-taek: Since he almost went astray, his conscience, principles, and consciousness are remarkable.\\nGood Wife: So when I get really angry sometimes, I add a prefix and call him a scholar, saying \\\"Are you Heosaeng from the Heosaeng story?\\\" But anyway, you know. Since he has a residence permit, a green card, we think about it. My mother-in-law often says \\\"You guys come over.\\\"\\nChae In-taek: But what was your most appealing, biggest reason? What was the biggest reason Hyochangdong Good Wife thought about immigration?\\nGood Wife: The biggest reason is children's education costs. Also, as I mentioned before, I don't really like hagwon education, and I found the competitive ranking culture in public education very painful. Not recognizing any uniqueness? Looking at my sons' personalities, I'm not sure if they'll be happy entering Korea's public education system. So I think about it sometimes. But the reason I ultimately didn't actively choose it after weighing pros and cons is gun problems and also I...\\nChae In-taek: Schools sometimes have shooting incidents?\\nGood Wife: Yes. And another thing is, if we go there, even though Korea recognizes me as a member of society regardless of income, in the US we'd immediately be guests or immigrants, somewhat excluded from that society.\\nStrong Mom: Outsiders.\\nGood Wife: Right. We'd have to live as second-class or third-class citizens. And living as a class doing menial jobs in society felt a bit... So actually, if I can do meaningful work here, work that changes society and contributes to society, wouldn't it be better to endure here even if it's difficult?\\nChae In-taek: So you gave up on the idea? But if you had gone, do you think your children's education would have worked out as you thought?\\nGood Wife: There are cases that worked out well and cases that didn't. Looking closely at acquaintances who went to the US for degree programs while having children, it seems less difficult than Korea. So while I haven't observed long-term effects, raising children of similar ages seems to have better infrastructure than Korea.\\nChae In-taek: I see. If you had gone, were you expecting a third child?\\nGood Wife: I decided not to have more children with this man.\\nChae In-taek: Yes, let me quickly move on to hear from others.\\nStrong Mom: My child is entering middle school.\\nChae In-taek: Super Strong Mom, are you thinking of pioneering an immigrant life with your middle school child based on your physical strength?\\nStrong Mom: Because of education.\\nChae In-taek: Education is the biggest factor?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, education. I also grew up with almost no hagwon education. None at all, I don't like hagwon education either. But if you ask whether public education is good, that's not it either.\\nChae In-taek: You can't leave everything to public education. Is that what you mean?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, if you do your best in public education, you get cut off like kakdugi [cubed radish kimchi]. That's what I think.\\nChae In-taek: Really? Rather, if you do well, like the saying \\\"the protruding stone gets hammered,\\\" you might actually receive hatred from various people and teachers. Is that your concern?\\nStrong Mom: That's part of it, but the evaluation system itself for being recognized in any society, for being first place, for doing something well - you have to do everything well. I'm not saying kakdugi is bad, but you come out as a standardized product. You come out as an excellent student, a model student.\\nChae In-taek: It would be hard to see my unique second generation. That's what you're saying.\\nStrong Mom: Moreover, my child is showing talent in art, but this talent through Korea's entrance exams and Korea's education - it becomes repetitive ranking. While that ranking can sometimes help with competition, I don't think it's good for a unique artistic world. There's that aspect too. It's the same with daily life. For children in our country, it's really a desperate problem. Because they're adolescents. They just go in the morning and come home after studying all night. That's for kids who adapt well. I don't want them to spend their teens like this and become emotionally dried up. Rather, I think it would be better to emigrate and study while raising the child, since I need to study anyway.\\nChae In-taek: Let mom go as an international student to study, and let the child receive education that allows them to freely express their individuality according to the local environment.\\nStrong Mom: And they'd learn English.\\nChae In-taek: That's your hope. Do you have thoughts about a third child?\\nStrong Mom: I actually wanted to have more, but I couldn't because of entrance exams. Because I had my first and second at twenty-four and twenty-six. I would have had more until thirty. But if I did that, my life wouldn't work out. If work-life balance were possible, why wouldn't I have more children?\\nChae In-taek: If your career and motherhood could be compatible, you would have wanted to have as many children as possible, but due to the current environment and background, you gave up additional births? Already about three people could have additional children. If our country had the background, environment, and systems like those foreign countries we think of, if we improved them, there would be sufficient possibility?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, there is. Of course.\\nChae In-taek: Then there's still a lot of possibility, you're confident about that, but Gold Spoon IV Mom who needs to be on an IV, you're relatively young here, I'd like to hear your opinion.\\nIV Mom: My child's father kept wanting to go abroad, but I thought it was better to stay put in Korea, and I lived complacently thinking we should continue living in Korea since we've lived here. But actually having and raising a child isn't easy, so that firm resolve is slightly shaken. Still, for now, I'm struggling to settle well and live in Korea. I hope this energy continues.\\nGood Wife: Gold Spoon has assets.\\nIV Mom: Yes, that's right.\\nChae In-taek: Does having assets make a difference? Are there no other reasons?\\nIV Mom: It's comfortable, that's true.\\nChae In-taek: Culturally comfortable to live?\\nIV Mom: Because friends and parents are all in Korea.\\nChae In-taek: All human networks are here.\\nIV Mom: There's no major financial burden.\\nChae In-taek: Even so, why did you have only one child?\\nIV Mom: But if I want to pursue a career or work, a second child would be difficult. Even for me, despite all this.\\nChae In-taek: Having more children would make it difficult for you to achieve social success. You want to continue studying, get a job and work, feel rewarded, but even one child is difficult?\\nIV Mom: Yes. And since I know how precious assets are, I have such a strong thought that I must pass this much to my child. If I have one more, it gets divided.\\nAlice: Are you thinking about inheritance from now?\\nIV Mom: If I don't plan this, I think it will be too hard for the child. Their future.\\nChae In-taek: Poor people worry because they don't have enough, rich people worry because it might get divided.\\nEasy Mom: We've never thought about this.\\nGood Wife: As long as we don't pass on debts.\\nIV Mom: Should I buy another house? I have to calculate such things.\\nChae In-taek: They say a person with a thousand seok [traditional unit of grain] has a thousand worries, a person with ten thousand seok has ten thousand worries. Let me listen first. What about Pyeongchon Easy Mom?\\nEasy Mom: When I was in college, I lived in the US briefly for a few months and became very close with Korean Americans. Since I went with my father, I didn't have my own friends, and my daily life was filled with my father's friends. They were all Korean Americans and they all said the same thing. If you have money, Korea is more comfortable and better to live in. Good convenience facilities, good transportation, convenient 24 hours, many friends. They said this while being wealthy people themselves, but they never actually came back. But when I thought about it after getting married, I think there are mainly two things. Housing costs are too high. When I lived in the US too, I only visited places like New York, but I lived in rural areas like Oklahoma.\\nChae In-taek: Cheap rent and quiet places?\\nEasy Mom: Oh yes. If my husband and I sell our current house and go there, I know our quality of life would be much higher.\\nChae In-taek: High real estate prices suppress quality of life. We can see it that way.\\nEasy Mom: Yes. While places like New York in the US are expensive too, there's much more land that isn't. Housing costs are really a big problem, and then the problem that really can't be solved is the education problem everyone mentioned. I also grew up somewhat unusually, but looking at it, I keep expecting that my child probably isn't suitable for public education or won't grow well in public education either. So if we continue living in Korea, children like mine who are somewhat unique will have to depend on hagwon education.\\nChae In-taek: How is your child unique?\\nEasy Mom: Well, what they do is a bit quirky.\\nChae In-taek: Can I hear that as having personality?\\nEasy Mom: They have personality, and if they're interested in something, they tend to dig into it.\\nGood Wife: Anyone listening would think it's a grown child.\\nEasy Mom: It's a three-year-old.\\nAlice: 25 months.\\nChae In-taek: You're talking about a three-year-old, 25-month-old child saying \\\"My child has genius qualities but I don't know how to handle it.\\\"\\nEasy Mom: But I'm really worried.\\nChae In-taek: In the future, there might be bigger challenges, not problems, but bigger tasks.\\nEasy Mom: Yes. Soon in 3-4 years, elementary school preparation is not far away, and I really feel it. The education problem is really something that can't be solved.\\nChae In-taek: But listening to you, Korean American elders you saw in the US said living in Korea is convenient. It's good for playing, living, and eating Korean food, but is Korea's condition really good for giving birth and raising children?\\nEasy Mom: Not at all.\\nChae In-taek: Not at all?\\nEasy Mom: Not at all.\\nChae In-taek: Then compared to other countries we think of, what's the biggest problem?\\nAlice: What's good about our country is for healthy adult men to play and live, but it's not good for diverse population groups to all live well - excuse the academic term. Various age distributions, from children to elderly - if you go abroad, all the roads are difficult to walk on, but when our people usually see it, they say \\\"Are the roads this well-developed?\\\" but in reality, it's hard to push baby strollers and elderly people find it hard to just walk.\\nChae In-taek: You mean things like curbs?\\nAlice: Yes. Starting from that. Safety is also a problem - I hurt my leg and walked with crutches. When you use crutches on one side, I was a person who was healthy but had ankle surgery after an injury. Even a person who was healthy, if someone bumps into you, it's really hard to endure.\\nGood Wife: You fall down.\\nAlice: The impact is very big, but our people don't consider such things at all. Starting from such things, facilities are also problematic.\\nChae In-taek: When you bump into someone, 'I'm sorry. Excuse me' - in Europe they'd say 'Pardon' - but we have a culture where if the other person isn't seriously hurt after bumping, we just pass by, not really caring about each other. This has continued for a long time?\\nAlice: And if you're even slightly unusual, everyone turns around to look at you like you're a foreigner. Such gazes. These things work in various ways. For someone like me considering immigration to developing countries, probably ordinary people like me, not gold spoons, would think about it a lot, but the biggest risk is definitely security. In Nepal's case, I saw many cases using local security companies, but the problem is how much you can trust those security companies.\\nChae In-taek: If you emigrate to developed countries, it's cost, and if you go to developing countries, it's security problems. We need to consider such problems.\\nAlice: You must consider it. Depending on whether the risk of security or my various dissatisfactions or anxieties when living in Korea is higher, you make the decision. We decided to stay because living in Korea might be more advantageous for us anyway.\\nGood Wife: 'From cradle to grave' is the motto of welfare states. Thinking from infancy through middle age to old age, in our country, the pre-adult period is a risk group. Educationally, we need to invest a lot in human resources to become functional people and find jobs. Before that, there are childcare problems. And if you're a woman, problems arise even after getting employment. Childbirth and housework. And when you become elderly, poverty and health problems arise. Current Korean society is improving a lot. It's improving a lot, but currently in Korean society, if you're sick, elderly, a woman, or an infant, it's a society with very high anxiety. Because social security is low. But if you have money, you can fill that gap - it's a structure where money can fill it.\\nStrong Mom: But usually earning 2 million won [approximately $1,500 USD] a month isn't easy. Generally speaking. Even if men work hard with their bodies, many households don't earn that much. But if you can't fill it with money and maintain the lowest level of life and environment, it's a very bad situation.\\nChae In-taek: You've mentioned very unsatisfactory aspects of Korean society with broad factors. Let's find specific, clear small factors. When did you think 'Ah, I really need to leave this country, leave Korea'? I've seen people around who had such thoughts when they stood in line for daycare and didn't get selected.\\nEasy Mom: Yes, that could happen.\\nChae In-taek: Could you share your personal experiences?\\nGood Wife: I mentioned my personal story before. During the IMF foreign exchange crisis [1997-1998 Asian financial crisis], my father lost his job and felt defeated, so he was ill for a long time. He was sick for 10 years and passed away. So we had to sell what little assets we had and use them up, and when he passed away in the hospital, huge medical bills came out. But this wasn't covered by insurance. Our country has national health insurance, but while it covers cheap diseases well, it doesn't cover major diseases as much as they say. If there's an infectious disease, you have to be isolated in a private room, and you have to pay for that yourself. We're aging very rapidly and there are many accidents, but if medical security is low despite having a national health insurance system, the anxiety is too great. You can only exert strength if your body is healthy. I thought a lot then, 'Ah, our country has systems but the security is really weak.'\\nChae In-taek: Since security isn't 100%, you can feel anxiety about what might happen while raising children.\\nGood Wife: Even though we pay health insurance premiums per household, we need to get cancer insurance, actual expense insurance for each individual family member, paying 500,000 won [approximately $380 USD] per month in insurance premiums to feel secure.\\nEasy Mom: Even then, rare and incurable diseases are difficult.\\nChae In-taek: There are countries like the US where 20 million citizens receive no medical coverage or protection?\\nGood Wife: But children and elderly are covered. Through Medicare and Medicaid.\\nChae In-taek: The 20 million are those who fall through the cracks.\\nGood Wife: But that's due to privatization - that's the problem with the US. Insurance companies hold hegemony and shake things as they please.\\nChae In-taek: The US has never had public insurance.\\nStrong Mom: So many people go to Canada.\\nChae In-taek: Canada follows the European method. It's a style that provides almost free medical services through taxes, but they point out that taxes are high. The middle ground is our insurance method, but insurance doesn't cover 100%, so there are problems. We need to keep working on it, but from the perspective of raising children, you think a lot about the anxiety that 'it might become a burden later'?\\nStrong Mom: Yes, that's right. And I have anxiety because of education. It's not a structure where talented people who want to study can do so, but where people with money can study and people with money become gifted - I think 'this isn't right.' So I often think 'I want to leave this country.'\\nChae In-taek: Ah, when hagwon education costs too much for children and you feel children are being educated uniformly, you feel frustrated inside?\\nStrong Mom: Because of money, even if you have talent...\\nChae In-taek: Cases where talent can't be developed because of money?\\nStrong Mom: There are many such cases.\\nIV Mom: I paid for everything financially, but I want to leave when I'm forced into traditional gender roles.\\nChae In-taek: What are women supposed to do? Women should be like this.\\nIV Mom: I bought the house myself. The house is my money, the car is my money, and living expenses are mostly my money. Since I'm not the type to force traditional male roles, I coolly paid for everything, but housework and childcare are my share, and career interruption is also my share - that made me so frustrated. There's something that can't be solved with money.\\nChae In-taek: Living as a mother in this land, even though I actively participated and shared all burdens equally, in the end childcare is supposed to be done by women.\\nIV Mom: When someone says \\\"Why is the house so messy?\\\" I get restless.\\nChae In-taek: Housework should also be done by women. They even force responsibility. Really?\\nIV Mom: There's that silent pressure.\\nChae In-taek: Adults come and say \\\"Why is the child's mother like this?\\\" \\\"Look at those clothes piled up.\\\" \\\"Did you hang the washing machine as decoration?\\\"\\nIV Mom: I bought everything with my money, everything. But hearing such words, I felt hurt thinking 'Ah, gender equality is still somewhat difficult.'\\nAlice: For me, this came as a triple combo. My father had a brain hemorrhage and was bedridden for about 20 years, passing away less than a month ago. There was that medical security problem. In my case, I wanted to study but really had no choice, so I kept going between working at companies and studying, and naturally time passed. Oh my, people who go abroad thanks to their parents study like that without spending expensive money. So the feeling of 'What is this world?' and 'What am I exactly?' - resenting my parents after age 30, this kind of thing came.\\nChae In-taek: You felt like you didn't get enough opportunities for self-development?\\nAlice: The starting line was different. Even the method of getting to the starting line - since my parents didn't receive such education, they couldn't teach me \\\"Where is the starting line?\\\" I can't resent them. It was natural for that generation.\\nEasy Mom: That was their best effort.\\nGood Wife: My uncle told me to marry an agricultural successor.\\nChae In-taek: What was the reason?\\nGood Wife: Because agricultural successors have money, so I could live comfortably. Before that, he told me to work at a factory.\\nAlice: My parents said if I go to commercial high school and get a job at a bank, I could marry well. Moreover, I worked extremely hard and have longer and thicker educational credentials than my husband, but they naturally expect me to do all the housework, so when this all comes together, \\\"Geez, what kind of situation is this.\\\"\\nChae In-taek: No matter what effort I make?\\nAlice: I can't escape from it.\\nChae In-taek: All the work women should do in traditional gender roles is my share? I raise children and do housework. Even then, \\\"Why can't you earn money?\\\" \\\"Aren't you studying because you like it?\\\" You hear such things? Ah, many people would really relate to this.\\nIV Mom: Hands are going up everywhere.\\nChae In-taek: Hands are going up one after another.\\nEasy Mom: I earn money too. I do housework too. I diligently raise children, have a good relationship with my husband, and my husband has the heart to try hard for work-life balance. Nevertheless, when I have such thoughts, it's this. My husband comes home early at 11 PM. When work explodes at the company, he seriously came home at 4:30 AM once. I really cried the next morning when he left at 6:30 AM. He came home, washed, and slept for an hour. I'm so worried about my husband's health. Our child says \\\"Did daddy go on a business trip?\\\" And last night too, hearing daddy come home, he woke up and played happily with daddy past midnight before sleeping. But I recently saw an article that Korean infants lack sleep time globally, and it broke my heart. Since fathers and mothers come home late, trying to see their faces for 1-2 more hours when they come in, infants end up like that. I'm really - our family isn't gold spoon or anything, but we've lived diligently and are trying to live as middle class, yet I'm so anxious. When my husband goes to work after sleeping 1-2 hours like that, I'm so anxious. It's the same for me. When I go to teach at provincial universities, I've actually often left after sleeping 1-2 hours. When life is like this, at every moment I constantly think 'Ah, isn't living here the right answer?'\\nChae In-taek: Ah, I can see tears now. You seem to feel tremendous pressure about this consuming life. As a result, you can't properly pursue family values, and it's really hard to have even minimal cozy time between family members. Even sleep time isn't sufficient for adults and children in such reality - you expressed dissatisfaction about this. Do you think emigration could solve many of these problems?\\nGood Wife: There's a scholar named Esping-Andersen. This person talked about something called the decommodification index. What is decommodification? Basic goods and services for survival and living don't need to be purchased with money. Or the purchase cost is very low. In such cases, the decommodification index is high. Usually, countries people want to emigrate to have socialized such basic services, with higher public spending than individual burden. Look, Canada has very low medical costs. Northern European education and medical costs are low.", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 27577, "output_tokens": 8000, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

School record-focused admissions account for 64% (2,171 students) of the total. The breakdown includes: 13% for academic track admissions selected solely based on school records [GPA], 18% each for the comprehensive school record admissions of Da Vinci-type talent and research-type talent tracks, and 14% for equal opportunity admissions. While the number selected through essay-writing exam [논술] admissions has decreased, it still represents the largest single track at 26%. We heard the secrets to success from students who were accepted through Chung-Ang University's comprehensive school record admissions last year.\\n\\nGPA grades 2.5→1.5→1.0\\nDa Vinci-type Talent Track Yu Jae-yeon / Chemistry Department, 1st year\\nAfter entering high school, I spent my first year aimlessly, but then I met my second-year homeroom teacher. The teacher said, 'You have potential, so let's try hard,' and gave me career advice. To make up for the lost first year, I participated in every school event without fail for the remaining two years. I also worked hard to raise my school records to the top tier. My school records became richer, and my grades steadily improved from 2.5 in first year to 1.5 in second year and 1.0 in third year. The decisive reason I was accepted through the Da Vinci-type talent track was that I concretely showed the process of my efforts.\\n\\nWhen writing my personal statement, I deeply understood the purpose of each question. I selected topics and established a framework for developing my writing by reading personal statement guidebooks, university-specific personal statement materials, and personal statements from seniors and friends. I tried to convey stories through my personal statement that couldn't be shown in my school records.\\n\\nFor personal statement question 1, which asks about efforts and learning experiences during high school, I used the example of my chemistry grade of 30 points. I felt limitations with my previous study method of mindlessly memorizing and repeating solution processes, so I made changes to my study approach. In my personal statement, I described this process concretely with examples of units, terms, and concepts. Through this, I tried to convey what I realized and my dream of becoming a 'vaccine development researcher.'\\n\\nReading textbooks six times thoroughly\\nResearch-type Talent Track Jung Woo-hyeon / Computer Engineering Department, 1st year\\nThe core keywords of my high school life were sincerity and character. I emphasized that I possessed excellent academic capabilities through sincere efforts toward my dreams, and I revealed my upright beliefs, character, and consideration through experiences. In my first year, I set my career path to become a software development specialist. I thought that creating excellent software requires diverse knowledge in mathematics, philosophy, arts, humanities, sociology, etc., so I absorbed knowledge through books I usually enjoyed. During this process, I developed the goal of majoring in software within the Computer Engineering Department. After setting this goal, I focused on extracurricular activities. In the school robot club called 'Magic Engineering,' I made robots using kits and studied with friends interested in software.\\n\\nIn R&E (Research & Education) activities involving learning through investigation and research, I completed a small thesis by researching encryption techniques using DNA base sequences. The process was as important as the research results.\\n\\nI described in detail in my personal statement the difficulties I felt in devising ideas, the experience of accidentally realizing the connection between DNA base sequences and encryption while listening to class lectures and setting my research direction, and what I learned about the importance of convergent thinking. I also fully demonstrated in personal statement question 1 that I studied without attending hagwon even once during my three years of high school. Every time I took an exam, I thoroughly read each subject's textbook at least six times.\\n\\nWriting daily study planners\\nDa Vinci-type Talent Track Kim Young-hoon / Business Administration Department, 1st year\\nFrom my first year of high school, I engaged in activities related to the major I wanted to apply for. In my second and third years, I narrowed my major to business administration and consistently engaged in related activities. I intensively managed my school records [GPA]. Throughout my three years of high school, I consistently wrote study planners, recording daily learning content and reflections. When my math grades fell below expectations, I analyzed the causes and made changes to my study methods. Instead of studying units in order, I tried to study actively by grouping related units. Then I began to see hidden conditions in problems and different solution methods. During a Korean history class when studying about Heungseon Daewongun's reconstruction of Gyeongbok Palace, I suddenly became curious about the differences between Eastern and Western economic theories and studied them through books and the internet.\\n\\nBefore writing my personal statement, I looked back on my entire high school life by reading three years of study planners. I could easily incorporate into my personal statement what efforts I had made and what I had learned. I think activities described in personal statements don't need to be grandiose. The key is 'what you felt through the activities' and 'whether your growth through experiences matches Chung-Ang University's ideal student image.' For example, I sincerely included experiences like operating a shooting booth at a festival by applying marketing theories I read in books, and discussing Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia in the school economics club. Presenting various experiences in my personal statement in accordance with the ideal student image led to good results.\\n\\nTwo hours of volunteer work weekly\\nEqual Opportunity Rural Student Track Ryu Hee-won / Social Welfare Department, 1st year\\nWhat I valued in high school life was selection and focus. During time when I needed to study academic subjects, I concentrated on studying, and I did my best in extracurricular activities with an enjoyable mindset. Being neglectful of academics because of school activities is an excuse. With selection and focus, you can manage time efficiently and catch both academic and extracurricular rabbits. In my personal statement, I concretely included activities that could reveal my strengths and the process of change and growth through them.\\n\\nIn high school, I served as president of an elementary after-school care volunteer club. It was an activity where we looked after children in after-school care classrooms for two hours every week. There were students with diverse characteristics and backgrounds: various ages, students with disabilities, passive students, bullied students, single-parent family students, etc. At first, there were many days when I couldn't proceed with prepared lessons. Feeling responsibility as president, I started writing club journals. I meticulously recorded lesson problems and children's characteristics, and through meetings we thought about new teaching methods. Watching the children's changes, I could think deeply about the role of a social worker, my future dream. I described these experiences concretely in my personal statement and connected them to my dreams.\\n\\nCradle of IT, Energy, Logistics, Financial Global Leaders\\n7 Specialized Recruitment Units\\nChung-Ang University selects and intensively supports 7 departments/majors that will lead the future. It is working hard to cultivate global talent who will become core leaders in future industries such as industrial security specialists, global finance specialists, and international logistics specialists.\\n\\nCultivating Software Professionals\\nComputer Engineering Department Software Major\\nThrough agreements with Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, it cultivates excellent software personnel and field-customized talent. The goal is to cultivate practice-based software specialists through innovative software major education programs. After providing scholarships for two years, students selected as industry-academia scholarship recipients from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics receive scholarships from each company for the remaining period. After graduation, they can obtain employment opportunities at the respective companies.\\n\\nCultivating Global Financial Talent\\nBusiness Administration Department Global Finance Major\\nThe Business Administration Department Global Finance Major aims to cultivate global talent who will lead the financial industry through high value-added creation. It operates with innovative curricula, and the university spares no support to strengthen students' capabilities. It operates two tracks: financial specialists and financial accounting specialists, with the goal of obtaining related certifications such as CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst), CPA (Certified Public Accountant), and AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) during their studies.\\n\\nDiverse Industry-Academia Linked Field Practice\\nEnergy Systems Engineering Department\\nIt provides convergence and complex education in engineering fields related to energy systems engineering. The goal is to cultivate global talent in nuclear power, thermal power, and eco-friendly power system fields. It conducts industry-academia linked field practice education with energy-related industry-academia cooperation companies. To cultivate professional personnel in global energy industries and cutting-edge energy research fields, it conducts research and practice across various fields including mechanical, electrical, and nuclear power.\\n\\nCooperation with Security Companies and Accounting Firms\\nIndustrial Security Department\\nStudents can learn about industrial security, management, crime prevention, legal systems, and security technology. Based on theories about industrial security strategies, it cultivates professional personnel with business literacy and security knowledge. It provides focused education through industry-academia cooperation with S1, Korea's largest security company, LG CNS, and major domestic accounting firms.\\n\\nNew Technology Research in Bio and Nano Fields\\nConvergence Engineering Department\\nThe goal is to research breaking down barriers between disciplines and sharing strengths of different disciplines to create new technologies. It operates biomedical engineering, nano-bio materials engineering, and digital imaging as detailed majors. Through global networks, it focuses on cultivating convergence engineers with the university and nation's convergence-related competitiveness and original research capabilities.\\n\\nInternships at Government and Domestic/International Companies\\nInternational Logistics Department\\nIt was newly established to cultivate core talent who will be active in global markets. Students can participate in internships supported by the government (Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Incheon Port Authority) and companies (CJ Logistics, Hyundai Glovis). Through cooperation with CJ Logistics and Hyundai Glovis, it provides two years of scholarships and domestic/international internships centered on International Logistics Department exchange students.\\n\\nProducing Administration, Policy, and Legal Elites\\nPublic Talent Department\\nIt cultivates core public sector talent encompassing administration, policy, and law. Students choose between an administration track preparing for civil service exams and national exams, and a policy track preparing for national policy specialists and law school. It provides native speaker classes for two years and opens and operates courses necessary for civil service exam subjects 1 and 2 and law school admission.\\n\\n\\\"Personal statements with same content as school records and recommendation letters lose credibility; essay-writing exam passages come from textbooks and EBS materials\\\"\\nInterview with Baek Gwang-jin, Director of Admissions\\nTo increase early admission acceptance rates, students must carefully identify and apply for admissions tracks that suit them among various options. Students confident in academics should consider school record academic track admissions, while students with balanced academic and extracurricular activities should consider comprehensive school record admissions. Essay-writing exam admissions are worth trying since acceptance is mostly determined by the essay-writing exam. We asked Baek Gwang-jin, Chung-Ang University's Director of Admissions, about effective admissions strategies.\\n\\n-You implemented comprehensive school record admissions for the first time.\\n\\\"We are increasing comprehensive school record admissions recruitment numbers every year. This year, like last year, we are conducting admissions divided into Da Vinci-type talent, research-type talent, and equal opportunity tracks. Da Vinci-type talent and equal opportunity tracks select students by combining 100% documents in the first stage and 70% documents plus 30% interviews in the second stage. Research-type talent track selects students with 100% documents without interviews. For personal statement question 4, which is a university-specific autonomous question, we used common autonomous questions prepared through joint research among major universities to reduce test-takers' burden.\\\"\\n\\n-What are effective admissions strategies by track?\\n\\\"Students with excellent school records [GPA] have an advantage in school record academic track admissions. Besides school records and CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] minimum academic standards, no other admission factors like documents, interviews, or essay-writing exams are reflected at all. In comprehensive school record admissions, we prefer students who have lived school life sincerely and are evenly excellent in both academic and extracurricular activities. Accepted students' school records range from 1st grade to 6th and 7th grades, but many accepted students are in the mid-2nd to 3rd grade range. Essay-writing exam admissions are worth challenging for students within the 6th grade school record range. The CSAT minimum academic standards are not particularly high, so the burden regarding CSAT results is relatively less. However, since more than half don't meet CSAT minimum academic standards, students must pay attention to CSAT until the end.\\\"\\n\\n-What do you look at in document evaluation?\\n\\\"Many students still simply list activities in their personal statements. In this case, it's difficult for admissions officers to identify students' strengths. It's better to write in detail focusing on things you can confidently highlight from your high school life. It's desirable to include motivation, content, role, problems, and solution methods for activities, as well as changes and growth through activities. Furthermore, students should seriously consider how such experiences will help when entering university and entering society.\\\"\\n\\n-What should be kept in mind when writing personal statements?\\n\\\"Sometimes personal statement content is exaggerated or written falsely. Personal statements are evaluated comprehensively together with school records and recommendation letters. If personal statement content doesn't match school records and recommendation letters, we can no longer trust the applicant. It's important to write it yourself with a sincere mindset.\\\"\\n\\n-How to prepare for essay-writing exam admissions?\\n\\\"Chung-Ang University produces all passages from textbooks and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] materials so students can pass essay-writing exam admissions through public education and self-directed learning alone. Current high school teachers participate in question creation so students faithful to school classes can achieve good results. Our university conducts mock essay-writing exams for over 10,000 people annually and provides correction guidance for all test-takers. We record these results in essay-writing guidebooks and distribute them to test-takers. Applicants should definitely prepare using Chung-Ang University's essay-writing guidebooks.\\\"\\n\\nPersonal statements should contain the 'behind stories' of school records\\nColumn by Cha Jung-min, Admissions Officer\\nThe 'readers' of personal statements are admissions officers at each university. What admissions officers evaluate through personal statements is not how spectacular and meaningful activities applicants engaged in. They look at applicants' capabilities and what motivation and processes they have grown through. Let's assume a student who was active in a school debate club applied.\\n\\nStudent A wrote in their personal statement: 'I entered the school's most famous debate club by breaking through high competition and enhanced my capabilities by encountering various debates about economics, society, and culture.'\\n\\nStudent B introduced themselves by saying: 'Feeling that my ability to write and speak logically was somewhat lacking, I joined the debate club to gain confidence through debate activities. By leading debates about welfare fields I was usually interested in, I improved my confidence and capabilities.' From an admissions officer's perspective, they can obtain more information about the student through Student B's personal statement.\\n\\nWhen writing personal statements, simply listing content from school records is meaningless. What awards applicants received, what clubs they participated in, and where they did volunteer work can easily be found in school records. Personal statements should introduce the 'behind stories' of activities recorded in school records. First, think about what experience during high school life was most meaningful and helped you grow.\\n\\nIf you've decided on a major, think about what capabilities are required for that major. Organize how you can connect the capabilities you can reveal through your high school life.\\n\\nPartnering with Global IT Companies to Cultivate Creative Talent\\nSpecialized Education Programs\\nChung-Ang University has begun cultivating talent with global sensibilities through customized career development. This university built cooperation programs with world-class companies Google, Microsoft, and Oracle for the first time among domestic universities to cultivate creative IT talent. This is to enhance students' global capabilities and provide employment opportunities by jointly developing and operating educational curricula with companies.\\n\\nChung-Ang University operates 'CAU-Creative Studio' for industry-academia cooperation with major global companies and runs customized startup education programs. Recently, it signed a partnership with Amazon Web Services for cloud computing education and discussed opening joint courses. It joined the Amazon Web Services education (AWS educate) program used by world-class universities like Harvard University and Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, allowing students to directly experience cloud technology and AWS.\\n\\nOperating Capability Development and Career Management Systems\\nIt also operates the CAU Rainbow System. This program consists of seven major areas: students' vision, career selection, capability development, employment support, SNS, counseling, and community. It is characterized by career management for the entire cycle from admission through academics, life, scholarships, graduation, and alumni activities, along with enabling students to independently develop capabilities that match their goals.\\n\\nIt presents concrete activities for developing capabilities needed for individual goals and operates social network services (SNS) where university members can share information.\\n\\nOpening 100th Anniversary Memorial Hall and Business Economics Building\\nLargest single building among domestic universities\\nThe 100th Anniversary Memorial Hall and Business Economics Building is a complex building designed considering Chung-Ang University's traditions and history, campus site, and harmony with existing buildings. Construction began in September 2013 with an investment of 120 billion won [approximately $90 million USD] and was completed last June. The 100th Anniversary Memorial Hall and Business Economics Building has basement levels 6 through above-ground 12 floors, with a total floor area of 75,058㎡. It's the largest scale among domestic universities as a single building. Inside the building are 82 lecture halls including 5 large lecture halls and 227 faculty research offices. There are various convenience facilities including restaurants. Twenty-four elevators and escalators are installed. Basement levels 1-3 house student support and administrative offices, above-ground floors 1-2 have 100th anniversary memorial spaces, and floors 3-12 have faculty offices and lecture halls.\\n\\nBy guest reporter Bong A-reum bong.areum@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9528, "output_tokens": 4308, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

This is the highest rating ever for a current affairs and entertainment program on comprehensive programming channels.\\n\\nThat day, 'Ssul Jeon' achieved remarkable viewership by intensively analyzing the Choi Soon-sil gate involving President Park Geun-hye's shadow power broker. In particular, former Minister Yoo Si-min (57) gained viewers' approval by providing concise yet clear commentary on the complexly intertwined Choi Soon-sil gate.\\n\\nThis has brought renewed attention to the appeal brief that former Minister Yoo wrote during his university days. Former Minister Yoo was sentenced to one year and six months in prison in 1984 for involvement in the 'Seoul National University Spy Incident' while enrolled in Seoul National University's Department of Economics. At that time, four agents disguised as students infiltrated Seoul National University to monitor students, and he was charged with confining and assaulting these spies.\\n\\nAppeal briefs submitted to the court are usually written by lawyers. However, former Minister Yoo wrote it himself at the recommendation of lawyer Lee Don-young, who handled his defense.\\n\\nFormer Minister Yoo served as a member of the 16th and 17th National Assembly and served as Minister of Health and Welfare under the Roh Moo-hyun administration.\\n\\nThe full text of his appeal brief, which became famous for its excellent logical development and persuasive writing style and was said to have been 'passed around even by judges,' is as follows:\\n\\nOriginal domicile: 163 Mangseong-dong, Naenam-myeon, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\\nCurrent address: Hanyang Apartment Building 11, Unit 1107, Siheung 1-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul\\nName: Ryu Si-min Date of birth: July 28, 1959\\nCharge: Violation of the Act on Punishment of Violence, etc.\\n\\nI, the defendant, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for violation of the Act on Punishment of Violence, etc. at the Seoul District Court Southern Branch on April 1, 1985, and in dissatisfaction with this, I submit the following appeal brief.\\n\\nFollows:\\n\\nI, the defendant, first wish to make clear that the purpose of this appeal is not to claim my innocence or to protest the severity of the first instance sentence.\\n\\nThis appeal is merely the product of efforts to fulfill my duty as a progressive human being who longs for a morally more advanced society. Also, I, the defendant, do not know what controversial issues are contained in the first instance judgment, nor do I wish to know. This is because what I, the defendant, am concerned with as a standard for judging the legitimacy of my actions is the measure of conscience given by God, not laws made by humans.\\n\\nAs I, the defendant, lack professional knowledge of law, I have had no choice but to build my life upon the simple belief that in a society where just laws are fairly administered, conscience's commands could never come into a mutually antagonistic contradictory relationship with law, and this will continue to be the case in the future.\\n\\nAll acts of violence that occur between humans and between human groups are essentially reflections of that society's current political, social, and moral level while simultaneously being one of the determining factors that decide its future level.\\n\\nTherefore, I, the defendant, who has been criminally prosecuted on charges of violating the \\\"Act on Punishment of Violence, etc.\\\" (hereinafter referred to as the Violence Act) and received a guilty verdict in the first instance, believe I have an obligation to clarify what kind of political, social, and moral state of our society this incident I was involved in reflects, what impact it will have on the future, and to clearly reveal the ethical responsibility of each individual and group related to the incident.\\n\\nIf our society can only learn the all-too-common lesson of \\\"Dog-shit and Cow-shit confined and assaulted Horse-shit, so they were punished\\\" from this unfortunate incident of young university students assaulting other young people of their generation, that would be an even greater tragedy than the incident itself.\\n\\nSimply put, this appeal brief is a petition requesting the court to give moral warnings to immoral individuals and groups, legal sanctions to those who violated the law, and a baptism of truth to citizens buried in false spirits.\\n\\nTo reiterate, since I, the defendant, am not arguing about law, when vocabulary such as 'responsibility,' 'duty,' 'fault,' etc. are used in this text without special modifiers, it is safe to regard them as having the modifier 'ethical' or 'moral' omitted.\\n\\nAnd I have used dots above words or sentences that I, the defendant, particularly want to emphasize.\\n\\nI, the defendant, intend to achieve the purpose of this writing by first defining this incident, then explaining it, and finally analyzing the actions taken by students and the current regime (I use the word 'regime' instead of 'government' to indicate that the Fifth Republic lacks legitimacy and legitimacy according to the basic principles of liberal democracy that I, the defendant, believe in) in relation to the incident.\\n\\nThis incident is called the 'Seoul National University Spy Incident' by students, and the 'Seoul National University Outsider Assault Incident' or simply the 'Seoul National University Lynch Incident' by the regime and mass media. This difference in incident nomenclature signifies that the two sides have completely different perspectives on viewing the incident, but this does not mean the essence of the incident itself changes.\\n\\nIf I, the defendant, were to define this incident from as objective a position as possible, this is an incident where numerous Seoul National University students detained and investigated four fake students suspected of being informants for investigative agencies in the process of escalated mutual antagonistic tension between the regime and the campus at Gwanak Campus, and inflicted some degree of or serious assault.\\n\\nTo clarify the 'mutual antagonistic tension between regime and campus,' we would need to examine the bloody history of the student movement's anti-dictatorship democratization struggle over the quarter-century since the May 16 military coup that trampled the April Democratic Revolution and established the first military dictatorship in this land, as well as the intensifying history of dictatorial regime oppression of campuses. However, considering that this is an appeal brief, I will limit myself to pointing out that there have been countless struggles including the 1964-65 anti-humiliating diplomacy with Japan struggle (the so-called June 3 incident), the 1974 People's Revolutionary Party struggle, and the 1979 Busan-Masan anti-dictatorship popular struggle, and will examine only the situation after December 12, 1979, when the core of the current regime was solidly formed and actually seized power through a military coup.\\n\\nThe economic contradictions, social conflicts, political corruption, and cultural decadence of our society today all originated and developed under the past Yushin dictatorship and achieved even higher growth under the current regime. The current regime is a blood-stained power that emerged through the process of trampling with military boots the hopes of the entire nation who had barely escaped the clutches of Yushin dictatorship and were optimistic about democratic recovery, and indiscriminately massacring Gwangju citizens who protested the May 17 atrocity using the 'people's army' armed with taxes and defense funds paid by the people.\\n\\nThe current regime is a power that was already morally bankrupt before it even officially launched. The 'new era' that the current regime speaks of is a new 'Yushin era' that could barely achieve even formal legality by painting all kinds of colorful decorations on the blatantly bestial Yushin dictatorship constitution and forcing it upon the people under the threat of guns and swords. The 'justice' they speak of means the authoritarian rule of a small military faction, and the 'welfare' they defend means the pleasure of the wealthy, including monopolistic chaebols.\\n\\nWe call fascism the ideological tendency that seeks to abolish various 'inefficient' democratic institutions (separation of powers, political parties, labor unions, free press, free assembly and association) for 'economic growth,' namely capitalist development. And modern history of this century proves that the end of such fascist states was either collapse due to large-scale war provocation that plunged all humanity into disaster and subsequent defeat, or even in the most fortunate cases, self-destruction through internal power struggles while forcing profound political and economic bankruptcy upon their people.\\n\\nNazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist Japan are representative examples of the former, while Spain's Franco regime, the military regimes of Chile and Argentina that emerged by overthrowing legitimate governments, the Yushin system that collapsed overnight, and the Marcos regime in the Philippines, which is now showing clear signs of collapse, are clearly typical of the latter.\\n\\nA state is precious not because it is a state, but because only it can provide conditions for all members to freely pursue happiness and self-realization without interfering with each other. For the past several years, labor activists who struggled demanding minimum conditions for human life, conscientious religious people who worked to realize God's kingdom on this earth, journalists and professors who endured hardship for truth and verity, and young university students who were at the forefront of democratic politicians longing for the restoration of democratic institutions have argued that the current military dictatorship, which is immoral, violent, undemocratic, and anti-people, and therefore could not be maintained for even a week under conditions where people could freely see, hear, and speak, cannot be a representative of our precious homeland. This is because we believe our people have the qualifications and ability to have a more democratic government.\\n\\nHowever, the current regime has detained about 1,300 students on various charges and expelled about 1,400 during the four years since the December 12 military coup, while forcibly conscripting at least 500 and dragging them straight from police station holding cells to military barracks. Not only that, but it has carried out unprecedented campus oppression by setting up surveillance posts in every corner of campuses, stationing plainclothes detectives permanently, and even mobilizing faculty members as riot suppression forces when that wasn't enough.\\n\\nYet it has never once admitted to these facts, and even when an unbelievable incident occurred where a young female student was sexually assaulted on campus by a suspicious person claiming to be an agent, the highest security authority calmly answered a National Assembly government inquiry: \\\"We have never stationed police on campus permanently. We will uncover the source of these rumors and root them out.\\\" The current distrust and hostility toward riot police, especially police, prevailing in campus areas is just one of the harmful results caused by such regime campus oppression and habitual lies by those in power.\\n\\nThe lie of the shepherd boy in Aesop's fable only resulted in the small incident of losing sheep, but King You of Zhou's false beacon fires lit to please the beauty Bao Si became the trigger that swept the entire Chinese continent into great turmoil for over 500 years thereafter. However, no wise person would call foolish the villagers who ignored the shepherd boy's cries or the feudal lords who abandoned the Zhou royal house until it was ravaged by barbarians.\\n\\nWhose responsibility is the students' distrust that refuses to believe the regime's claims even if they said beans could make soybean paste? Moreover, barbaric and immoral campus oppression provoked life-risking resistance at universities nationwide, resulting in countless students losing their lives or suffering serious injuries. At Seoul National University alone, three young lives were sacrificed: the late Kim Tae-hoon, Hwang Jeong-ha, and Han Hee-cheol.\\n\\nSuch situations continued with little change even after the so-called autonomy measures of December 1983, except for the single change that the main front moved to the school gates, and were particularly intensified around last September's student council revival, with investigative agencies' campus surveillance, checkpoints and searches at school gates, tailing and forced detention. That is, even after the so-called autonomy measures, the 'antagonistic tension between campus and regime' continued to persist.\\n\\nThis incident occurred almost spontaneously under just such conditions because several fake students committed acts that made them suspected of being informants for investigative agencies. The circumstances that led to their suspicion and the course of events have already been revealed, so there is no need to discuss them again, but some additional explanation about the fake students would be helpful here.\\n\\nWhether they were actually informants is certainly a matter of extreme political interest, but it is an issue distant from the legal and ethical aspects of the incident. This is because what the students detained, confined, investigated, or assaulted were never informants or simple fake students, but 'those suspected of being informants,' so the violence itself cannot be justified, nor can all of the students' actions be called entirely unjust just because they were not informants.\\n\\nThe reason I, the defendant, do not discuss this issue again is not because I think they were not informants, but precisely because of the above reason.\\n\\nThe numerous fake students who roam campuses disguised as students for various purposes are an anti-social human group that parasitizes campuses by taking advantage of the dehumanization phenomena such as atomization and isolation of university members caused by various systems devised by the dictatorship to make universities fall into becoming mass training centers for professional functionaries who are paralyzed in critical consciousness of social reality and only interested in their own prosperity, such as the graduation quota system and relative evaluation system in today's large-scale, comprehensive universities. They are a cancerous existence that creates widespread distrust among university members and destroys the university's healthy community culture by being complexly related to theft, fraud, sexual harassment, and auxiliary activities of campus surveillance (like in Son Hyeong-gu's case) that occur daily on campus.\\n\\nThe current regime has been neglecting or encouraging the proliferation of fake students because not only do they destroy university members' sense of unity, but they can also shift responsibility for the numerous problems caused by stationing plainclothes police on campus onto them (as in the female student harassment incident).\\n\\nTherefore, there is no need to explain what kind of disgust students normally harbor toward them. When these fake students are caught collecting information about student activities while pretending to be students at small gatherings of returning students, in reading rooms, at the law school office, or in classrooms, would it be ethically right to overlook this out of fear of the law? In a mutually antagonistic atmosphere, could it be possible to request identity investigation of fake students suspected of being informants from the very investigative agencies that presumably sent them?\\n\\nOf course, since university campuses are open places, it would not be illegal at all even if hundreds or thousands of uniformed and plainclothes police rummaged through the campus as in the past, not just secret surveillance activities. However, I, the defendant, have never heard anyone say such behavior is morally desirable.\\n\\nOn the other hand, any substantial resistance by students against such immoral campus oppression, though ethically justified, would clearly violate current law. It is precisely here that the mutually antagonistic contradictory relationship between law and conscience that could not exist in a just society inevitably arises. No one can keep both law and conscience in this situation.\\n\\nThe students' claim that this incident is a concentrated expression of the political and social contradictions facing our entire society, including university society, is based on precisely this argument.\\n\\nLaw possesses the power to enforce itself, but conscience does not. Law is temporary and relative, but conscience is absolute and eternal. Law is made by humans, but conscience is given by God.\\n\\nSo I, the defendant, followed conscience. This was not because keeping the law was unimportant, but because following conscience's command was more important. Not only I, the defendant, but all students did so, not just in this incident but in all previous incidents as well. This is how the series of incidents over ten days last September occurred.\\n\\nHowever, this incident, which was not very complex in itself, brought serious shock waves including Seoul National University students' sit-in at the New Korea Democratic Party headquarters, expulsion and detention of major student council leaders, major offensive by the regime and mass media about 'violence in student movement,' Seoul National University's test boycott struggle and large-scale police deployment, and concluded with guilty verdicts for defendants who almost completely denied the prosecution's charges.\\n\\nThe New Korea Democratic Party headquarters sit-in led by student body president Baek Tae-ung and belatedly by Oh Jae-young, who was chairman of the spy incident response committee and college of social sciences student body president, on September 28, the day after the incident ended, was intended to elevate this spontaneous, unorganized incident into an organized struggle criticizing immoral campus surveillance and the regime's undemocratic nature. Even if students had legal and ethical faults in the process of investigating fake students, this could not cover up the separate political issue of campus surveillance existence, so I, the defendant, think this struggle was completely justified in itself.\\n\\nThe day after this, on the evening of September 29, school authorities suddenly expelled four major student council leaders: Lee Jeong-woo, Baek Gi-young, Baek Tae-ung, and Oh Jae-young. I, the defendant, was forcibly taken by police without a warrant on the afternoon of September 30, investigated for several days, and then detained. The reason I was taken first was because I did not flee in advance, I did not flee because I felt no need to, and I felt no need because I had done nothing wrong enough to run away.\\n\\nI, the defendant, made no modifications or reversals during police and prosecution investigations and court testimony except for minor errors due to memory limitations, and only told the truth as it was. Anyway, on October 4, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Chief announced the investigation results of the so-called 'Seoul National University Outsider Assault Incident' through various newspapers, TV, and radio, according to which this series of incidents of confining and assaulting four outsiders was intentionally and systematically created under agreement between myself as the representative of the Returning Students Council and student representatives.\\n\\nHowever, at least none of the several students (including myself) who were taken by police before October 4 made any statements supporting this announcement, and if one examines all the detention warrants, indictments, and related students' interrogation records created afterward by date, it is obvious to anyone that they were all made to fit the basic line of this announcement.\\n\\nIn short, the essence of the October 4 police announcement is nothing but distortion, exaggeration, fabrication and falsification for some political purpose. That purpose was nothing other than to slander the student movement as violence-oriented destructive activity, thereby concealing not only the political character of this incident but also the violence and immorality of the current regime itself. To achieve this purpose, this incident had to be created not spontaneously and accidentally, but systematically and intentionally by representatives of student organizations.\\n\\nOnly then could they slander not just a few related students but the entire student movement. Therefore, the student body president, student defense corps president, spy incident response committee chairman, returning students council representative, etc., had to become the easiest sacrificial victims for propaganda, regardless of what kind of people they actually were and what actions they actually performed.\\n\\nOf course, this method is nothing more than following the old methods that dictatorial regimes spanning decades have routinely used whenever opportunities arose, and is nothing new. And as a result, the current regime appears to have succeeded to some degree in substantially blocking the activities of major leaders of the Seoul National University student council that had just launched, while damaging the morality of the student movement that even 600,000 troops could not crush.\\n\\nTherefore, they could even taste some self-satisfaction as if they had become more moral beings. The prosecution also rushed only to support the police announcement rather than uncovering facts, filed charges with similar content, and has been obsessed only with that.\\n\\nEvidence of this is the fact that in November of last year, more than a month after the incident occurred, detectives from Gwanak Police Station's investigation division extracted false confessions consistent with the charges by inflicting severe torture on innocent students Kim Do-hyeong and Son Taek-man, to use their own expression.\\n\\nThat is, police fabricated evidence that we defendants violated the 'Violence Act' by violating that very 'Violence Act' through torturing related students. Even ignoring the fact that such fabricated false confessions were adopted as evidence, the important issue of 'equality before the law' still remains.\\n\\nUnlike the past emergency measures or current 'Assembly and Demonstration Act' that had no legitimate ethical foundation and therefore conscientious people felt no need to feel an obligation to obey, I think this 'Violence Act' is a law that should be and can be kept.\\n\\nHowever, each person is placed in an unequal position before this law depending on their political views toward the current regime. I, the defendant, perhaps excessively, have never even heard similar stories of information division detectives at police stations in front of each university, who habitually assault and torture students, being criminally prosecuted for violating the 'Violence Act' because of this.\\n\\nHowever, when an incident occurred on May 19 last year where Lee Gyeong-eun, wife of Seo Won-gi who was also an expelled student from Korea University, suffered a miscarriage of her six-month-old fetus from kicks by detectives at Dongdaemun Police Station while returning home after attending a memorial service for Gwangju Uprising victims hosted by the 'Youth Coalition for Democratization Movement,' it became obvious to everyone that the couple was outside the protection of this law. This was because the prosecution did not even begin investigation despite receiving the complaint.\\n\\nI, the defendant, have also been assaulted several times while being taken and investigated by investigative agencies, but have never dared to request protection under this law. Yet despite never threatening or assaulting anyone, I, the defendant, was found guilty under the Violence Act.\\n\\nI, the defendant, bring up past events like this only to remind of the existence of what is commonly called the prosecution's political bias. That is, to point out that the police officers handling this case were also not unrelated to the current regime's political conspiracy mentioned above.\\n\\nIn conclusion, most of what the prosecution claims as charges is intended to support incident content fabricated by police for impure political purposes, based on one hand on general prejudices widely spread through collaboration between the regime and mass media, while simultaneously supported by false confessions of related students that police extracted through torture investigation, filled with empty content.\\n\\nHowever, I, the defendant, am not loudly denouncing the regime's immorality like this to avoid the students' faults revealed in this incident and my own legal and ethical responsibility. Even if detaining and investigating fake students was ethically justified, I have no intention of justifying the assault inflicted on them. Detention for investigation should be as brief as possible and there should be no assault.\\n\\nOf course, not everything that appears violent phenomenologically belongs essentially to the realm of violence, but assault by a crowd against powerless individuals, even if it was an expression of reasonable hostility toward police and an imitation of torture they habitually inflicted on students, should be judged as clearly deviating from the student movement's nonviolence principle.\\n\\nAlso, the fact that those who committed assault did not step forward to take responsibility themselves, even considering the special political circumstances that made it difficult at the time, I think is an expression of students' ethical deficiency. However, I, the defendant, am convinced that the beautiful act of student body president Lee Jeong-woo, who had absolutely nothing to do with assault and no relation to the entire incident, taking on all responsibility himself and even giving up appeal, filled to some degree the ethical vacuum created by no one readily taking responsibility for assault.\\n\\nI, the defendant, also never gave instructions for speech or investigation (because there was no need to give instructions), but if it had been necessary, I would have gladly detained and investigated them directly at any time (though I knew well it was illegal). As the de facto representative of the Returning Students Council, I, the defendant, was in a position where I had to fulfill not only the passive duty to observe nonviolence principles personally, but also the active duty to ensure this principle was implemented at the overall level of the student movement.\\n\\nTherefore, I, the defendant, certainly have greater ethical responsibility than other students for witnessing Jeon Gi-dong and Jeong Yong-beom being beaten on the night of September 26 and not trying to stop it (though I don't know about the legal aspect). Also, in the cases of Lim Sin-hyeon and Son Hyeong-gu, when I, the defendant, encountered the incident, detention and investigation were already in progress, so there was no need to give any instructions.\\n\\nHowever, since I, the defendant, clearly agreed to detention for investigation and even personally conducted investigation briefly, it is certainly true that I violated the law and I will gladly bear the resulting responsibility. However, in these two cases, I did my best to implement the principles of detention as brief as possible and nonviolence, and these principles were actually implemented, so I, the defendant, feel no ethical responsibility.\\n\\nAnyway, I could have acted like Lee Jeong-woo to take on the considerable legal and ethical responsibility that belongs to me, and I believe that would also have been a good thing. However, as already stated, because of the possibility of becoming a plaything in the regime's all-too-obvious conspiracy, I, the defendant, resolved never to admit anything different from facts, no matter how trivial, and have approached the court struggle with such an attitude.\\n\\nOnly this way can I, the defendant, show that the sense of responsibility I feel is fundamentally different in nature from what is demanded through force to make the charges a fait accompli.\\n\\nAlso, I, the defendant, want to tell you what the political meaning of this case's trial is and that the judiciary must fulfill its inherent ethical duty to make this incident an opportunity for moral progress in our society.\\n\\nThis incident occurred against the background of accumulated distrust and hostility between regime and campus, when information-gathering activities by several fake students that were not illegal at all but clearly immoral provoked students' response that was not essentially immoral but clearly illegal.\\n\\nVarious immoral acts shown by the current regime over the past several years - the act of security authorities who stationed hundreds of police on campus while giving false testimony to all citizens, investigative agencies' continued covert campus surveillance under the beautiful signboard of so-called autonomy measures (this was revealed in detail in court), acts of fabricating and distorting even this incident for impure political purposes - are merely different branches sprouting from the same root.\\n\\nHowever, this trial is not about identifying the true cause of the incident and prescribing treatment for it, but about punishing only the illegal parts of students' actions. Perhaps the judiciary itself has no intention of defending such immoral regime campus intrusion. However, the first instance judgment that defined even detention for investigation (not the assault part) as subject to criminal punishment while completely ignoring all context amounts to nothing less than a 'Safety Guarantee Declaration for Fake Students and Informants' guaranteeing the personal safety of numerous fake students and informants who may still be roaming campuses for various anti-social purposes at this very moment.\\n\\nI, the defendant, by no means demand acquittal for all students' actions. As I repeat, moral warnings must be given to immoral people along with legal sanctions against law violators, and citizens buried in false propaganda must receive baptism of truth. Without clarifying responsibility for the situation, moral improvement for all of us cannot be expected.\\n\\nCourts are sacred not because they are courts, but because only there can one tear off beautiful masks of falsehood and meet the true face of truth, even if it sometimes looks ugly.\\n\\nIf today's judiciary establishes justice even if the sky falls, and if that justice does not mean rule by the strong, I, the defendant, believe the truth buried in the first instance trial process should be able to receive life again. Otherwise, we will probably have to see thorns of anger added to the already high walls of current distrust and hostility that are not easily torn down because of this incident, and we will certainly encounter similar situations that will explode in even more violent forms someday.\\n\\nDuring the past five years, about 1,500 prisoners of conscience imprisoned on various charges for opposing the current regime were all without exception found guilty by righteous judges in these 'sacred courts.' Even under the bestial Yushin dictatorship, just as many people were imprisoned for not keeping the unprecedented evil law 'Emergency Measures.' Reporting on Emergency Measures violations was also Emergency Measures violation, so no one could even speak of it. Lawyers making arguments were also detained because of their arguments.\\n\\nNow there are few who claim Emergency Measures were just laws, and few who say those imprisoned then were 'anti-social impure elements' or 'treasonous actors,' but the courts that made them 'prisoners' are still said to be 'sacred' and the prosecutors and judges who indicted and convicted them are also said to be working for 'realization of justice.'\\n\\nIf someone says 'our country's judiciary has turned away from justice so far,' that would mean 'courts have been used as execution grounds for democracy.' If someone says 'our country's judiciary has established justice so far,' and if he is truly a serious person, he must firmly believe 'justice is the will of the dictator.'\\n\\nI, the defendant, want to be tried in sacred courts in the sense that only there can one meet the true face of truth, not because the smell of blood shed by murdered democracy is thickly soaked there.\\n\\nI, the defendant, earnestly hope that the judge who sentences me guilty is not the kind who 'is interested in justice only within limits that don't shake his position' but a wise judge who 'establishes justice even if the sky falls.'\\n\\nAnd I believe that revealing truth is building the foundation upon which justice stands.\\n\\nBased on the above discussion, I, the defendant, want to briefly mention reasons why I cannot accept the first instance judgment. When I, the defendant, received the judgment, I could not help but feel truly sorrowful. This was because it was almost unrelated to the incident content revealed through the trial process conducted seven times.\\n\\nTherefore, I belatedly realized that the entire trial process I had approached so earnestly was nothing more than a worthless formality conducted to plausibly decorate a predetermined judgment.\\n\\nFirst, in 'Criminal Facts' Item 1 of the 'Judgment Reasons,' the part \\\"...witnessing Lim Sin-hyeon being...assaulted, defendant Yoo Si-min had unidentified students confirm and investigate the above Lim Sin-hyeon's identity...\\\" could not even be established in terms of formal logic.\\n\\nIf the existence of a student who received instructions from me, the defendant, was proven, how could he be unidentified? And I, the defendant, never admitted this once, and even relying entirely on statements by student Baek Su-taek and others, as well as Lim Sin-hyeon's own court testimony, it would be impossible to prove that I, the defendant, was at the scene where Lim Sin-hyeon was detained and beaten, so how could it be proven that I, the defendant, gave some instruction to someone unidentified?\\n\\nIn fact, I, the defendant, was not there at that time.\\n\\nNext, in 'Criminal Facts' Item 2, the part \\\"...the above Kim Do-in assaulted in front of defendants Baek Tae-ung and Yoo Si-min...causing multiple contusions requiring three weeks of treatment to the said person (referring to Son Hyeong-gu)...\\\" also contradicts even Son Hyeong-gu's own court testimony that he \\\"was never assaulted once while being investigated by Baek Tae-ung and Yoo Si-min.\\\"\\n\\nAnd in 'Criminal Facts' Item 3, \\\"defendant Yoo Si-min...from about 21:00 on the same day (September 26) until 01:00 the next day, together with defendants Yoon Ho-jung, Oh Jae-young, and Baek Gi-young, Nam Seung-woo, Oh Seung-jung, Ahn Seung-yoon, etc....resolved to continue investigating (Jeong Yong-beom)...\\\" and similar passages in 'Criminal Facts' Item 4 are also merely distortions of the fact that I, the defendant, had lengthy discussions with election management committee members about ongoing student body president election management and problems with student council regulations at the time, as was clearly revealed by statements from Oh Seung-jung, Kim Do-hyeong, etc.\\n\\nThese few examples merely point out parts that are particularly remarkably different from facts, and it goes without saying that the entire judgment contains innumerable similar contradictions too difficult to enumerate.\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon reflecting the regime's intention to make the entire incident appear as if it proceeded intentionally under the command of me, the defendant, and student representatives. In fact, most of the judgment content is evidence that it was copied verbatim without changing a single particle through detention warrants and indictments from the October 4 police announcement that exaggerated, distorted, fabricated and falsified last year.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I must judge that the first instance judgment completely abandoned the judiciary's social duty to contribute to moral improvement of our entire society by clarifying the ethical and legal responsibilities of each individual and group related to the incident.\\n\\nTo reiterate, I, the defendant, pointed out the unfairness of the first instance judgment like this not to avoid my responsibility but because I want a guilty verdict based on valid reasons.\\n\\nFinally, I, the defendant, who has become a model of 'violent extremist students,' will make a few words of excuse for myself in place of concluding this appeal brief. This is because I, the defendant, am by no means more passionate than others or someone who likes to show off, much less a young person stained red or worshipping violence.\\n\\nI, the defendant, am nothing more than the most ordinary young man you can commonly see", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "max_tokens", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 23936, "output_tokens": 8000, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Gangnam Regular High Schools in the 'Holistic Admissions Era'\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"Polarization. This is the current state of regular high schools in Seoul's Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], an education hub. There's a clear divide between preferred schools and avoided schools. The transformation in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high school landscape is largely due to educational policy changes and shifts in university admissions systems. In other words, external shocks rather than internal problems have driven the changes. The establishment of specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools, the introduction of high school choice systems, and the expansion of holistic admissions have been reshaping the regular high school terrain. We examined the current state of Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools.\\n\\n| 'Holistic Admissions Era' - Changing Atmosphere\\nBut why are Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] mothers paying attention to regular high schools again?\\nWhile top students were lost to specialized and autonomous private schools, elite Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] schools like Sookmyung Girls' High School and Dankook University Affiliated High School were less affected. Polarization between preferred and avoided schools intensified after the high school choice system.\\n\\nControversy over the crisis facing regular high schools continues. Some argue that specialized high schools and autonomous private high schools (autonomous schools) have devastated regular high schools by monopolizing top students. Others point to the standardized curriculum represented by the humanities-science track system as the fundamental cause. This controversy is particularly heated in Seoul, where 23 autonomous schools (including Hana High School) have been established. Even Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], known as an education hub, is not free from this issue.\\n\\nWhile Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools have recently improved their college admission results, they pale in comparison to their reputation during the 8th district era of the 1980s. Polarization among Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools is also notable. While some regular high schools have seen their reputation rise despite having prestigious autonomous schools nearby, others have fallen and been stigmatized as schools to avoid. This landscape emerged after the implementation of the high school choice system in 2010. We examined the polarization phenomenon among regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul].\\n\\nGangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools are not free from the controversy over high school hierarchization that follows the order: specialized schools → autonomous schools → regular high schools. While the situation has recently improved, it's utterly shabby compared to their reputation during the old 8th district era. From the perspective of Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools, this is unfair. Their reputation crumbled due to external shocks rather than internal problems.\\n\\nIn 1986, four schools located in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho districts made it into the top 5 high schools with the most Seoul National University acceptances: Kyunggi High School (75 students), Sangmoon High School (54 students), Whimoon High School (52 students), and Seoul High School (51 students), marking the golden age of Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s 8th district. Kim (50), who graduated from Seoul High School in 1984, recalled, \\\"Seoul National University accepted 50-60 students each year, and Yonsei and Korea Universities each accepted about 100 students. Those were the days when the 8th district dominated newspaper headlines daily.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, the 8th district myth ended starting in 1992. Science high schools and foreign language high schools gained approval as specialized schools, leading parents hungry for elite education to choose specialized schools. At that time, hagwons [private academies] preparing for specialized school entrance exams were so crowded that classes didn't end until after 2 AM. When nationwide autonomous schools like Minjok Leadership Academy, POSTECH Academy, and Sangsan High School were established in 2002, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]'s hagwon district was shaken once again.\\n\\nThe Seoul National University admission performance of 8th district schools, which had produced as many as 80 Seoul National University acceptances per school in the 1980s, plummeted by the 2007 academic year. Instead, specialized schools took over these achievements entirely. The top 10 Seoul National University acceptances for the 2007 academic year were swept by specialized schools in science, foreign languages, and arts. Seoul Arts High School ranked first with 88 students, Seoul Science High School ranked second (72 students), and Daewon Foreign Language High School ranked third (64 students). Only Kyunggi High School barely maintained its presence at 11th place (17 students), with Seoul High School, Sookmyung Girls' High School, and Whimoon High School each ranking 14th (16 students). From the 2014 academic year onward, it became a battle between nationwide autonomous schools and specialized schools like Yongin Foreign Language High School and Hana High School. In the 2016 academic year Seoul National University acceptance rankings, Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools fell even further. Only Sookmyung Girls' High School managed to hold onto 22nd place by getting 22 students accepted.\\n\\nWhen five schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho districts (Sewha High School, Sewha Girls' High School, Joongdong High School, Hyundai High School, and Whimoon High School) converted to metropolitan autonomous schools in 2010 and the following year, the shock to regular high schools in the area was considerable. A college counseling director at a private girls' high school in Seocho District, Seoul, remembered, \\\"The sense of crisis our school felt in the 2010 academic year when local autonomous schools began selecting new students was tremendous. Many of the top-tier students who would have enrolled in our school transferred to nearby autonomous schools.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, Seoul's autonomous schools only accepted students who ranked in the top 50% of middle school records [GPA] and selected them through lottery. (※Starting from the 2015 academic year, Seoul's autonomous schools select students through lottery followed by interviews without middle school record restrictions.) Autonomous schools benefited significantly from the selection effect of securing top students. In the 2011 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] when these five schools were still regular high schools, the average percentage of students scoring within the top 2 grades in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subjects (Korean, English, Math) was only 16.3%. However, starting from the 2013 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] when they began producing graduates selected as autonomous schools, this percentage surged, reaching an average of 36.8% for the five autonomous schools in the 2015 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. This represents a 20.5 percentage point increase in just four years.\\n\\nDuring the same period, CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores of top students at Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District's regular high schools also improved. The percentage of students scoring within the top 2 grades in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] at 13 regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District increased from 15.2% to 17%. In contrast, Seocho District slightly declined from 13.4% to 11.9%. The situation was similar in other education hubs like Songpa, Yangcheon, and Nowon districts. Yangcheon and Songpa districts increased by 2.1 and 0.3 percentage points respectively, while Nowon District slightly declined by 0.5 percentage points.\\n\\nAs autonomous schools followed specialized schools in monopolizing top students, controversy over the devastation of regular high schools intensified. Kim Hye-nam, a school teacher at Seoul's Munil High School, said, \\\"In non-Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] regular high schools, the classroom atmosphere depends on whether there are three or four top-tier students forming a leading group in each class. As specialized and autonomous schools swept up excellent students, the atmosphere in non-Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] regular high schools particularly became so deflated that it was difficult to conduct classes.\\\"\\n\\nThe situation in education hubs including Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] was somewhat better. Despite the autonomous school shock, regular high schools maintained a reasonable academic atmosphere. This was thanks to the thick layer of studying students. Along with the growth of the hagwon education market, students continuously flowed into so-called education hubs like Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul], Seocho, Songpa, Yangcheon, and Nowon districts. The net migration (incoming-outgoing) of 10-14 year-olds to Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District reached 1,706 in 2000. It was 2,196 in 2005, 2,120 in 2010, and reached 1,666 last year. A vice-principal at a private boys' high school in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District said, \\\"Honestly, the reason Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul]'s regular high schools could maintain their academic level despite losing top students to specialized and autonomous schools was the power of Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] hagwon education.\\\"\\n\\nSome regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho areas showed signs of revival with the expansion of holistic admissions in 2014. The admissions officer system that began in 2008 initially placed great emphasis on external specs like mock international conferences, academic competitions, and camps for admission. When controversy arose over hagwon education including expensive consulting, the Ministry of Education completely banned recording external specs in school records [GPA] starting in 2011, and in 2014 reorganized and expanded the admissions officer system into holistic admissions that evaluate only school records [GPA] and in-school extracurricular activities. Seoul National University's holistic admissions selection ratio exceeded 70% of total enrollment, and major universities like Yonsei and Korea Universities expanded their holistic admissions selection ratios to 30-50% of total enrollment.\\n\\nAs the evaluation scope was limited to in-school activities only, school records [GPA] became the first gateway for holistic admissions success. Lim Seong-ho, CEO of Jongro Academy Sky Education, analyzed, \\\"Looking at Seoul National University acceptances, regional balance requires early 1st grade school records [GPA], and even general admissions requires at least 2nd-3rd grade. School records [GPA] have emerged as the core of major universities' holistic admissions.\\\" Lee Jung-hee (42, Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]), who has a 9th-grade child, conveyed the atmosphere: \\\"Now many mothers think it's more beneficial to send their children to regular high schools with solid in-school programs rather than autonomous schools with fierce school records [GPA] competition, and manage school records [GPA] well.\\\"\\n\\nLee Mi-ae, CEO of Sharon Coaching, said, \\\"In the first year of autonomous schools, there was extreme bias due to expectations, but now mothers accurately weigh the pros and cons between autonomous and regular high schools.\\\" She explained, \\\"Students who go to autonomous schools now fall into two main categories: either top-tier students who can achieve within top 3 grades in school records [GPA] at autonomous schools, or mid-level students who give up on school records [GPA] but seek autonomous schools to improve CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores through better study atmosphere.\\\" Jang Ji-young, vice-principal of Jinseon Girls' High School, said, \\\"The shock was great in the first year of autonomous schools, but from around 2014, middle school top students began turning their attention to regular high schools. This year, students who ranked in the top 5% of middle school records [GPA] comprised 15% of our total incoming students.\\\"\\n\\nSeoul has been implementing a high school choice system since 2010, where students write first and second preferences in both first and second stages, allowing them to apply to up to four schools total before lottery assignment. If students are not assigned a school in the first and second stages, the third stage considers their first and second preference schools first, then assigns them based on commuting distance and religion. While assignment to desired schools is not 100% guaranteed, it opens a path to choose preferred schools to some extent.\\n\\nThe high school choice system clearly reveals preferences among regular high schools. The most important criterion determining preferred schools is naturally college admission performance. Looking at the number of Seoul National University acceptances for the 2016 academic year in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho areas, Sookmyung Girls' High School (22 students) leads, followed by Dankook University Affiliated High School (19 students) and Seoul/Yeongdong High Schools (16 students each). Kyunggi High School and Chung-Ang University Affiliated High School each sent 14 students, while Jungsan High School, Kyunggi Girls' High School, and Yangjae High School each sent 13 students to Seoul National University, emerging as preferred schools. This appropriately mixes 5 private and 4 public schools. Conversely, schools with poor performance became schools to avoid.\\n\\nThe high school choice system essentially transformed the regular high school landscape. In the 2005 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], among regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho areas, Dankook University Affiliated High School had the highest percentage of students scoring within the top 2 grades in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] subjects (Korean, English, Math) at 17.4%. The lowest was Seoul Sejong High School (2.2%). Excluding a few outstanding schools and some lagging schools, most schools formed a thick middle layer in the 10% range. At that time, forced assignment was based on residential areas, so top students were appropriately distributed among schools, preventing severe gaps between schools. However, looking at the 2015 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores of students who entered in 2012 after the high school choice system implementation, the gap among regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho areas widened to 26.2 percentage points. Schools chosen by students and parents as educational consumers clearly separated from those that weren't.\\n\\nPolarization among regular high schools is commonly found in Songpa, Yangcheon, and Nowon districts beyond Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] and Seocho. The gap in the Gangdong-Songpa school district, which includes Songpa District, widened from 11.4% to 14.2% during the same period, and the gap in the Gangseo-Yangcheon school district, which includes Yangcheon District, widened from 9.1% to 14.2%. Private girls' high schools' success is particularly notable. Based on the 2015 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam], among regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District, Sookmyung Girls' High School had the highest percentage of students scoring within the top 2 grades in CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] (33.2%), and in Seocho District, it was Seomun Girls' High School (15.1%). CEO Lim Seong-ho diagnosed, \\\"Since there are few autonomous schools that girls can attend, the phenomenon of female students flocking to girls' high schools with high academic levels has intensified.\\\"\\n\\nSome public coeducational schools are notorious among parents as schools to avoid. Among 13 regular high schools in Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] District, three public coeducational schools belong to the bottom 5 group with low percentages of students scoring within the top 2 grades in the 2015 CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam]. Lee (46, Nonhyeon-dong), who has a 9th-grade male student, confessed, \\\"Especially C High School, which is a public coeducational school, has terrible student guidance and poor college admission results, so everyone hopes their child won't be assigned there.\\\"\\n\\nWhat factors divided preferred and avoided schools? Experts point to 'principal leadership.' For regular high schools with fewer resources compared to specialized and autonomous schools to prepare for holistic admissions, they must draw out cooperation and dedication from all school teachers. This is because each teacher must take charge of 2-3 clubs while planning and operating project classes and various in-school competitions.\\n\\nMin Byeong-gwan, principal of Yangjae High School, argued, \\\"To lead changes in regular high schools, we shouldn't rely only on individual schools' will, but must establish foundations for principals to exercise leadership as managers. We need to guarantee personnel rights to principals and broadly guarantee autonomy to freely organize school budgets and curricula.\\\"\\n\\nBy Jeong Hyeon-jin, reporter Jeong.hyeonjin@joongang.co.kr\\nPhotos by Shin In-seob, photographer shinis@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 7324, "output_tokens": 4246, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Collapse (1)\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"_ 30 Minutes Before the Collapse\\n\\nSometimes there are days when you crave cup ramen. I wait for steam to come billowing out of the spout of a stainless steel kettle, not water hurriedly boiled in a plastic electric pot. I carefully sprinkle the soup powder into the cup ramen, pour in the water, and wait three minutes while reading the text printed on the lid. Then it's complete—hot and spicy cup ramen that's crude yet seems to contain all the flavors in the world. Ramen, tissue paper, sanitary pads, and cigarettes aren't items that sell particularly well on specific days. About half the customers who come and go from the 'Danggok 24-Hour Convenience Store' where I live with the TV on twenty-four hours buy these predictable items and pay for them. I wait for them while eating cup ramen or reading day-old newspapers. That's my job. Of course, it wasn't the job I dreamed of when I was young...\\n\\nHe too was one of those predictable people buying predictable things. With his sports haircut mixed with a bit of gray and neat, dark eyebrows that left an impression, he would occasionally stop by to buy ramen or cigarettes. Sometimes he would pay for canned coffee and gulp it down right there at the counter before trudging away. It was around the time when August's sweltering heat was beginning to yield to the sleet. He had placed a five-pack of ramen on the counter and was hanging his head. As I scanned the barcode and handed him his change, a lukewarm droplet fell with a 'plop' onto the back of my hand. Thinking it might be rainwater, I casually looked up to see his pupils—like black holes—steadily and vacantly shedding tears without a tremor. I could tell he was crying only because the tears had fallen; otherwise, he wore the same peaceful, bored expression as always. When the transaction was complete, he nodded slightly and left the store. Even after his presence disappeared, a cold aura he had left behind lingered in the cramped convenience store. I completely forgot that my cup ramen was getting soggy as I stared through the glass window plastered with beer advertisements in the direction he had vanished. Through the glass where thick raindrops rolled down like tears, I couldn't find any trace of him. Only the brilliantly lit GS25 convenience store sign across the street caught my eye.\\n\\nAs years pile up and you age, you inevitably get covered by the spider webs of indifference. Curiosity that once shone like jewels would disappear without a trace the moment it got caught in those spider web-like threads of indifference. Smacking my lips, I was picking up the soggy noodles with chopsticks when I saw the family photo on top of the beverage refrigerator and couldn't help but chuckle. The small photo album that could be folded and unfolded like a folding screen contained all the years that had passed. I was thirty-two when I gave up on the civil service exam I had been obsessed with since college. After confirming that my name wasn't on the second-round pass list, I drank all night and returned to my boarding house to throw all my law books in the trash. The end of blind pursuit was emptiness. Thinking of my parents' wrinkled faces—they had expected a judge, prosecutor, or at least a lawyer for a son—I squeezed my eyes shut and wailed, banging my head against the empty bookshelf. The first thing I saw when I woke up was Youngsim, the daughter of the boarding house owner. As she placed a wet towel on my forehead with worried eyes, I grabbed Youngsim's arm and cried bitterly for a long time, and she warmly embraced me as if she understood. That winter, we went ahead with our marriage despite opposition from both families. With both sets of disapproving parents on either side, Youngsim smiled brightly with a two-month-old baby in her belly. And I had to plunge into a war with a new life I had never known before. After working as an insurance salesman, water purifier salesman, and then teaching at various specialized hagwons, my parents, taking pity on me, offered me money as land purchase compensation when we had been married for six years and our son Hwi was five years old. What I established with the money my parents gave me was this Danggok24, a convenience store that wasn't really a convenience store. The business that had been doing reasonably well at first saw its sales cut in half due to real convenience stores that increased along with the growing number of office buildings. The photos that reminded me of such various memories from the past were eventually dominated by Hwi as he grew bigger. The child who always smiled brightly was staring at the camera with a gloomy, cold expression in the last two photos. After it was confirmed that he had contracted acute lymphocytic leukemia—a disease I had never heard of—around the time he was about to enter elementary school, the child always had to be in the hospital. Since no family member had compatible bone marrow, he received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a bone marrow bank in Japan. Watching Hwi suffer through the bone marrow transplant, I cried and cried. But all I could do was guard this old, narrow fake convenience store. Only then could I provide some comfort to my son battling for his life moment by moment in the hospital and my wife who was watching over him...\\n\\nSniffling, I wiped away the tears that had gathered in my eyes and stirred the chopsticks in the cup ramen broth. Somehow, I had to survive. I stuffed my mouth full of noodles that had gotten so soggy they broke apart. I desperately wanted some cola that would let me burp refreshingly, but I couldn't bring myself to touch it. Taking a sip of lukewarm barley tea I had brought from home, I naturally let out a sigh. When you're alone, all sorts of thoughts come to mind. Sometimes in the personnel announcements in newspapers I occasionally read, I would see the names of friends who had studied with me and passed the civil service exam.\\n\\n'Those bastards, back then they were always whining to me that they couldn't do it...'\\n\\nWith a bitter smile, I brushed off the past and turned the channel on the television placed on top of the refrigerator. It was a secret from my wife, but I made sure to watch a daily drama featuring an actress who looked remarkably like my first love. The actress who had been struggling in a predictable story of birth secrets and stepmother abuse was in the middle of screaming after learning that the man she liked was actually her half-brother. I was sniffling along with the actress who was quite good at capturing emotions when I got annoyed at the bold letters 'Breaking News' that suddenly appeared at the bottom of the screen. As I was clicking my tongue, I was stunned by the words 'Sehwa Hospital Collapse' that appeared next. Sehwa Hospital was the hospital my child had been transferred to earlier this year. While I sat there unable to close my gaping mouth, the screen changed. The anchor, who had been frowning deeply as if the earphone in his ear was malfunctioning, looked at the screen in confusion as if he had received a cue signal belatedly.\\n\\n'We bring you breaking news. Sehwa General Hospital suddenly collapsed at around 4 PM today. Currently, over a hundred fire trucks and ambulances from nearby fire stations have been dispatched and are conducting rescue operations, but there are successive speculations that many casualties may have occurred due to the sudden nature of the collapse. Let's connect to the scene. Reporter Kim Boseong, please come in.'\\n\\nThe anchor's anxious and urgent voice, so different from his neat appearance, echoed through the convenience store. The screen changed again and was chaos itself. The reporter standing with the collapsed building debris behind him spouted rapid-fire words, but I couldn't hear anything.\\n\\n'There, in there, my wife and child are in there.'\\n\\nThick streams of water sprayed from fire trucks poured down like tears over the collapsed hospital. The wildly shaking camera showed residents who had clearly poured out from nearby apartment complexes. After silently capturing the chaos, the camera returned to the reporter and also captured another person standing to one side.\\n\\n'Currently, the exact cause of the accident and the scale of damage have not been revealed, but considering that the collapse occurred so instantaneously and there are testimonies that no one escaped immediately after the collapse, we cannot rule out the possibility of casualties exceeding those of the Sampoong Department Store collapse. Let's hear from an eyewitness for a moment. Where were you at the time of the incident?'\\n\\n'Well, I was diligently shining shoes at the shop in front of that hospital when I suddenly heard something like thunder. Since it was a clear sky, I wondered what kind of lightning it could be and poked my head out, and that hospital just came crashing down. This is the first time in my life I've seen such a thing.'\\n\\nThe bald middle-aged man in his fifties was speaking enthusiastically, spitting as he talked. The reporter pulled the microphone back and asked again.\\n\\n'Didn't you notice any strange signs just before the hospital collapsed? For example, strange sounds coming from the building?'\\n\\n'What?'\\n\\nAt the reporter's surprised question, the bald man spoke again with a face full of conviction.\\n\\n'It was a pretty little girl, about seven years old. She was flying around like a butterfly over that collapsed hospital.'\\n\\n'No, not that kind of thing. I mean signs like cracks appearing in the building or the ground sinking. Other witnesses say there was a loud sound from the hospital direction about an hour ago.'\\n\\nAt the clearly flustered reporter's words, the bald man got angry.\\n\\n'Those Samhwa apartment people are all liars whenever they open their mouths. This Bae Daesik has been polishing shoes right here for exactly thirty years. Thirty years...' The reporter, startled by the bald man's rambling, hurriedly said thank you and withdrew the microphone. An arm from outside the camera frame grabbed and pulled the bald man. Shaking off the arm trying to drag him away, the man shouted at the screen.\\n\\n'Why are you doing this! I definitely saw it with my own eyes, a young girl flying around over the collapsed hospital. Grinning, she was. It was definitely a nine-tailed fox. When I was young, my grandmother used to say...'\\n\\nThe reporter, unable to stand it any longer, pushed the bald man out of the frame. The man disappeared outside with a death cry, his arm flailing once or twice at the edge of the screen before vanishing. I had been quietly watching this ridiculous scene unfold in the small rectangular space when I suddenly jumped up. The belated thought struck me that my beloved wife and son were trapped under the debris of that massive building. Without even turning off the television, I pulled down the shutter and rushed out of the store. I ran frantically toward the main road. The rainy streets were quiet, but no empty taxis were in sight. As I ran blindly toward Sehwa Hospital, looking back to see if any empty taxis were coming, I eventually got into a taxi stopped at a traffic light.\\n\\n'Sehwa Hospital!'\\n\\nIgnoring the taxi driver's grumbling about the seat getting wet, I clasped my hands tightly and prayed. Although I had only gone to church a few times since my son got sick, my head filled with desperate calls to God was full of nothing but regret. I remembered how I had casually agreed when my wife suddenly suggested moving our son to Sehwa Hospital early this year. My wife had rambled about various things, but I was having a headache because the building owner had suddenly demanded a rent increase, so I just nodded absently.\\n\\n'Please, God.' Traffic control began from the intersection where Sehwa Hospital could be seen in the distance. Police in blue raincoats and vinyl-covered caps ran between cars waving red warning lights, and the long line of stopped cars expressed their frustration by honking their horns. Before the taxi driver could finish saying we couldn't go any further, I jumped out of the taxi and started running between the vehicles. Steam rising from the heated car hoods flowed backward toward the sky through the rain. After passing the major intersection, the congestion became even worse. The narrow uphill road leading to the hospital was packed so tightly with ambulances, fire trucks, and even broadcasting station vehicles that there wasn't room to stick a needle through, and reporters wearing construction site hard hats were running around with large cameras. Since everyone was busy with their own tasks, the uphill road wasn't too difficult to pass, but the large iron gate of the hospital was already being controlled by police. Riot police with new riot helmets and shields had almost occupied the wide-open iron gate, blocking people. In front of the riot police, people who appeared to be families of patients who had been in the hospital surged like waves. People poured out their individual stories with their respective voices, but their desperation was remarkably unified. Increasingly weakening raindrops rippled between the people who formed a massive wave. A seemingly high-ranking police officer shouted into a megaphone at the people.\\n\\n'Rescue operations are currently in progress. We understand your feelings, but this could lead to additional casualties, so please comply with the control measures.'\\n\\nThe people who had been quiet for a moment began crying out again, starting with someone's shout. I too joined those people, constantly looking for my son, my wife. The combination of emotions brought rapid amplification. The wave of people gradually pressed forward. The blue shields struggled to hold against the wave of people. Sensing that the opposition was gradually crumbling, people shouted 'heave-ho, heave-ho' as they pushed forward, and reporters around held up huge cameras and greedily pressed their shutters. The counterattack from the shields that had been continuously pushed back began. With a resounding battle cry, the inflated shield walls skillfully broke up the waves of people. Those in the front row grappled with the riot police, but most people caught up in mob psychology tucked their tails and ran as soon as they heard someone was being arrested. Like ants escaping from a destroyed anthill, people scattered in all directions, and I too was swept along by the wave. Breaking away from the frantically running crowd, I hid in an alley where a blue truck was parked. Somehow I had to get inside the hospital and confirm whether my family was alive or dead. I had no idea how to find my wife and child among all that debris, but I was thinking only of rescuing my family with my own hands, even if it meant scraping away the debris with my bare hands.\\n\\nThe rain-soaked alley had only one cat licking its front paw, seemingly completely uninterested in the commotion outside. Hiding deeper inside to avoid the pattering footsteps of people passing by outside the alley, I saw an unfamiliar scene. About twenty people were quietly standing in the rain in front of a Hanssem furniture store with its shutter down. It would normally have been a scene I'd glance at and pass by, but the bold Gothic letters 'Korea Life Rescue Association' embedded in the middle of the back of their sky-blue vinyl raincoats caught my eye firmly. On one side, people who hadn't yet received raincoats were receiving them from a man standing in front of the furniture store. The hope that I might be able to get inside by joining them led me forward. The vinyl raincoats made rustling sounds with the slightest movement. I cautiously approached those who were all turning their backs to me and asked hesitantly.\\n\\n'Excuse me, if you have any spare raincoats, could I get one?' Instead of an answer, what came back were cold, suspicious stares. The intimidating gazes from people of various genders and ages made it hard to breathe, but thoughts of my family gave me courage I didn't have.\\n\\n'My family is also in there. If you just let me in, I'll do whatever you tell me to do.'\\n\\n'This isn't a place just anyone can join.'\\n\\nA big man who suddenly emerged from among the hesitating people said this. He looked like a gangster at first glance, but the tension that had reached its peak swallowed even fear.\\n\\n'Then just give me one of those raincoats. I have to get in there somehow.'\\n\\n'You seem to have ear holes, so why can't you understand? I told you this isn't a place for you to join.'\\n\\nThe other party, pointing one finger straight up, poked my chest repeatedly while spitting out words mixed with profanity. Wiping away the rain that clung to my face like sweat, I too pushed back against the other party's chest without backing down.\\n\\n'I told you my family is in there. Is this how people who gathered to rescue lives should talk?'\\n\\n'Well, this is...'\\n\\nA cracking sound came from the neck of the man who turned his neck once with an incredulous expression. What stopped this man was another man.\\n\\n'Samsik. Stop it.'\\n\\n'Ah, hyung-nim too...'\\n\\nThe man who had briefly swept his short hair hidden under the raincoat with his palm withdrew his dissatisfied expression. With the man's threat gone and the scattered people's entangled gazes received once more, the dry awkwardness ended when the man who had been distributing raincoats in front of the Hanssem furniture store approached. I was about to make another request when I was startled to see the other party's face.\\n\\n'Wait, aren't you...?'\\n\\n'If you have a cigarette, let's share a smoke.'\\n\\nAt the other party's unexpected words, I rummaged through my pockets. The cigarettes I had quit when my son was hospitalized had come back to life since this spring. A cigarette pack with just two cigarettes left came out of my pocket. When I held out the slightly rain-dampened pack, the man shook his head.\\n\\n'Not now, after we go in and come back out.'\\n\\nAnd then he handed me a sky-blue raincoat rolled up in one hand.\\n\\n'Look here. If we let such riffraff join our team, it'll become a complete mess.'\\n\\nAlthough I heard dissatisfied words from behind me, the man replied with a bright expression. 'Gilsu-ssi. Mr. Na Jeonghyeon isn't riffraff; he was originally supposed to join our rescue team. He just didn't know today's schedule because he couldn't open the invitation.' The man called Gilsu with a broad face reluctantly nodded and shut his mouth. The man who checked the time by shaking his wrist shouted toward the sky-blue raincoats scattered here and there in the alley.\\n\\n'Everyone, attention! It's now 4:40. We'll now infiltrate the hospital disguised as a civilian rescue organization as planned. I'll be at the front with the priest. If anyone asks, just say you're a member of the Korea Life Rescue Association. If there's a problem at the main gate and you can't get in, go to the office building I mentioned earlier and wait, and if you do get inside but get separated from others, just come alone to the lobby of the Clinical Research Center behind the main building. Any questions?'\\n\\nThe people in sky-blue raincoats who had gathered in front of the man glanced at each other with heavy, complex expressions. A young man with glasses in the back raised his hand high.\\n\\n'How do we get from the lobby to that place?'\\n\\n'The original passage must have collapsed, but there are several emergency passages prepared for that. We'll use one that's in good condition to enter.'\\n\\n'What about after we go down there? Are we directly rescuing our families?' A slightly older man among the middle-aged couples who were holding hands and trembling in one corner asked.\\n\\n'That's...'\\n\\nThe man with a troubled expression turned his eyes to another man standing right below him. The other man who received his gaze pulled back his hood and turned to the people. I saw the Roman collar around the neck of that gaunt man with venomous eyes. Adding the quiet words 'priest' from people nearby, he was probably a Catholic priest. The priest spoke in a voice that carried a different kind of uprightness from the previous man.\\n\\n'You will have to meet the creatures that your greed and avarice created down there.'\\n\\n'When you were sweet-talking us into signing, that was one thing, but what's the point of saying such things now.'\\n\\nThe owner of the voice full of discomfort, who stood right in front of the priest, was a young woman with her hair tied tightly back. As other people seemed to agree with the woman's words and nodded, the atmosphere became as cold as the rain.\\n\\n'How many of you joined this affair with pure hearts? Didn't you gather here to prevent what will happen when they return?'\\n\\nI couldn't understand what the priest was saying, but I decided to listen quietly for now. The priest's passionate speech grew hotter.\\n\\n'We didn't gather here to achieve something noble. We gathered to hide ugly truths, and everyone knows this while pretending to worry about their families.'\\n\\n'Is that bastard really a priest?'\\n\\nThe grumbling from the man who had poked my chest with his finger earlier was immediately buried by the sharp voice of another woman who popped out.\\n\\n'No. This is all God's will. God, who bore all the sins of the world, has given us a signal toward a new world. We must all pray. We must abandon false and corrupt false religion to follow the true will. Let's all pray.'\\n\\nThe woman wearing round glasses without frames tightly grasped what appeared to be her husband's hand and offered a prayer.\\n\\n'They're all doing various things.' Someone's grumbling couldn't overcome the words pouring out rapidly like a rapper from a young couple. The atmosphere was chaotic enough that they seemed ready to scatter at any moment, but no one left their spot.\\n\\n'Stop it and let's get moving. If we stay gathered here like this and catch other people's attention, it could become troublesome.'\\n\\nIt was that voice that had mentioned making a mess earlier. Although the eyes hidden by the hood weren't visible, judging by the appropriately fleshed chin and slightly upturned lips, he felt like a man in his mid-thirties who hadn't yet had his vitality stolen by time.\\n\\n'Understood. Please all put on the name tags I distributed earlier and follow me.' The man who had stepped down from in front of the Hanssem furniture store put on his name tag. The name tag, coated to the size of a palm, had 'Cha Jaekyung' written on it.\\n\\nAuthor Profile: Born in Seoul in 1973.

With a smile playing on his lips, keeping his eyes on the monitor, he casually said, \\\"In case you forgot, you're now at an age where you should be taking vitamins or health supplements.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that exact moment, my heart began racing. This is an impossible relationship in this world. A gentle, peaceful romantic relationship that could accept even the passion burning for someone other than themselves—this is an absurd fantasy. But just as my heart beat uncontrollably when our Don Quixote, armed with worn armor and weapons, set out 'to dare to dream the impossible dream, to dare to love the impossible love, and to dare to go where even brave people haven't gone,' my heart pounded again before that impossible relationship.\\n\\nFor a long time after, I thought about the two people in 'Love Tooth.' The director doesn't explain what twists and turns led their cohabitation to reach that level (or state). They don't even tell us what kind of work the ideally portrayed live-in boyfriend does, or with what feelings he observes his girlfriend's new romance. We only learn that they were high school classmates and that the man has been divorced once.\\n\\nInstead of this 'unkind' director, I often imagine the history of these two people that the movie doesn't show. For convenience, let's call the woman J and the man Y.\\n\\nSince they're thirty years old, J and Y would have each experienced the romantic, passionate ecstasy of love where dopamine and adrenaline are secreted at will at least once or twice. But if there was a difference, it would be that riding the wave of their respectively most intense love emotions, Y got married and J moved in with someone. And like other people, they too witnessed how that emotion called love withers with time or intimacy. But what made them unable to live like other people was that they were the type who believed more in romance novels like Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' or Boris Pasternak's 'Doctor Zhivago' than Jung Yi-hyun's 'Romantic Love and Society.' Eventually Y gets divorced and J leaves her live-in boyfriend. And as a man and woman who don't believe in marriage or cohabitation premised on marriage, they live alone for a while. Then J and Y, who meet again through the gods' mischief, drink late into the night, saying that whether it's marriage or cohabitation premised on marriage, they're the same in that they monopolize love and constrain people.\\n\\nThat's as far as it goes. So please don't ask whether they came to cohabitate as simple roommates or whether they came to live as lovers who occasionally share a bed. I'd like to leave the rest to the two people's 'secret.' Life without 'secrets' is bound to become miserable.\\n\\n◆Biography=Feature team director at licensed fashion magazine 'BAZAAR,' author of 'Beautiful Monster' and 'Kim Hoon is Kim Hoon and Psy is Psy'\\nKim Kyung, Columnist\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3191, "output_tokens": 810, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Born in Incheon, he moved to the United States after finishing high school and received his education in educational psychology and technology education from the University of Southern California in 1999. From 1996 to 2000, he served as CTO of the University of Phoenix, America's largest online university, where he developed innovative educational environments and operating systems such as virtual classrooms and simulation systems. After joining Stanford University in 2001, he has developed and operated various courses related to educational technology.\\n\\nProfessor Paul Kim is particularly an outstanding talent who contributes to improving educational accessibility and equity by traveling between developed and developing countries. He practices 'education without borders' by personally traversing various parts of the globe and undertakes educational policy projects and consulting in various countries in the Middle East, South America, and Asia. His SMILE (Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment) project was selected as a UN Future Education Innovation Technology in 2016. Rich in ideas in both education and business management, he is an excellent CTO who promotes entrepreneurship and supports startups as a global figure. He can be called a rising management guru sufficient to inspire domestic entrepreneurs pursuing innovation. This is why Forbes interviewed him.\\n\\nI understand you're an educational technologist and CTO. What kind of work do you mainly do?\\nI'm an educational technologist who develops experimental educational programs or systems, applies the developed programs and models to educational sites worldwide, analyzes their pros and cons, organizes them, and publishes them as papers. I'm also an entrepreneur working in the education industry myself. Currently, the educational technology industry is such a hot market that $3 billion [approximately $3 billion USD] has been invested in education technology-related industries in the United States. Major global publishing companies in America are rapidly transforming into digital companies by acquiring and merging educational technology-related companies through M&A. Coaching and consulting for them is also part of what I do. I also give advice to students preparing to start education technology-related businesses.\\n\\nProfessor Paul Kim is a pioneer in educational technology who developed an online education system that could accommodate 500,000 simultaneous users for study as early as the 1990s. He said he's currently creating programs for leadership training of knowledge education-related companies regarding lifelong education for corporations.\\n\\nWhat kind of lectures do you give for companies?\\nMostly online lectures. I lecture on leadership or lifelong education-related content by creating databases of interviews with many companies and CEOs. I'm also innovating lecture methods. Harvard Business School uses PDF files, Stanford Business School mainly uses multimedia for lectures, but I'm preparing to create lectures where you can directly simulate like playing games. If what Harvard Business created is version 1 and what Stanford created is version 2, what I'm doing is version 3.\\n\\nWhat should be done for century-old, sustainable companies?\\nIn this era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, employees must continuously update and renew their abilities. Only then can companies survive. Now is not a world where you can succeed by being good at just one thing. Already, survey data from 2009-2012 showed that companies could survive only when each employee acquired five or more skills (abilities). Now that level is nowhere near enough. One person must have 15 or more skills to survive. When current elementary school students get jobs 10-15 years from now, 65% of currently existing jobs will be gone. The competencies companies will require then will be completely different from now.\\n\\nRegarding corporate lifelong education systems these days, the educational business becoming an issue is the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) system, an online open course platform. If you enter there, you can watch lectures from famous universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford for free. Companies like Coursera, edX, and Udacity are such companies. My two daughters also go online to Stanford to attend lectures. Starting in America, MOOC companies supporting each country's language have emerged in Germany, Japan, China, Spain, etc. I understand K-MOOC is also being attempted in Korea.\\n\\nIt sounds like you're saying companies must become learning centers for their employees in order to survive.\\nThat's right. For companies to survive, lifelong education for employees is essential. Corporate-led lifelong education is possible through online education companies, not offline. As a CTO, I'm helping companies in that field. There's an online education company called UDEMY in America. Along with Linda.com, PluralSight, and Treehouse, it's a company representing the paid MOOC market. It's an online practical university for working people, where for just $40 [approximately $40 USD], working people can apply for and take any education they need. UDEMY's slogan is 'Anyone can learn anything.' In the future, companies will contract with such education companies and take responsibility for employee education. It's unlimited educational refills for employees. (Laughs) Of course, companies must bear the education costs. Only such companies will survive in the future and become century-old companies. If companies become permeated with the idea of just staying safe and going on as now, entrepreneurship disappears.\\n\\nHow can we revitalize the declining entrepreneurial spirit?\\nAll change comes from cultural change. Companies must also lead by example starting with the CEO. To put it somewhat roughly, cultural differences create innovation differences. MOOC is the same. Rather than just telling people to do MOOC, you must create time and an atmosphere where employees can study online without worrying about others' reactions. For companies to grow quickly and always remain in innovation mode, there must be a culture where employees can engage in self-development. Facebook and Google encourage employees to use 10% of their daily time for self-development, hobbies, or volunteer activities. Stanford, where I work, is the same. Stanford's competitiveness is diversity. Whether Nepalese or Bangladeshi, capable professors become presidents and deans. It's purely merit-based regardless of race, gender, or nationality.\\n\\nKorea isn't at that stage yet.\\nOf course I know. In Korea, you have to be a Seoul National University graduate to become a Seoul National University professor, become an associate dean, and rise to dean positions. But this kind of culture doesn't help the continuous development of ideas at all. New ideas from outside must come in to serve as catalysts that accelerate innovation. What kind of culture the field I live in has is very important. In America, whoever chairs that day's meeting sits in the center of the conference room. If you're not chairing, the team leader must sit at the very end. Companies and countries are the same. In other words, companies where you can't tell who's the team leader and who's the employee are innovation companies now. That's Silicon Valley's culture, Stanford's culture. Professors sit at the very end and coach. It's helping experts demonstrate more expertise. Innovation cannot succeed in a culture like ours where people open notebooks and say 'just tell us what to do' while being busy writing down what's said.\\n\\nProfessor Paul Kim recently published 'The Future of Education: Coaching, Not Teaching.' It's a book organizing conversations with literary critic Ham Don-gyun, HK Research Professor at Korea University's Institute for Korean Culture. The gist is that what teachers should do is not teaching knowledge but becoming coaches who point out important contexts and help and guide students by properly understanding their limitations and potential. His argument is that if teachers focus only on teaching without doing this, children lose opportunities to think and ask questions. According to him, Korean students and American students, especially Stanford students, have completely different learning attitudes. Most Korean students are passive and don't ask questions well. They mainly ask 'how to get a job well' or 'what to do to get a job at Samsung.' In contrast, Stanford students mainly ask 'I want to create a company bigger than Samsung, how should I do it?' His argument is that such cultural differences acquired from school lead to innovation differences when they get jobs and work at companies.\\n\\nWhat is Stanford University's competitiveness?\\nA questioning culture. Companies that don't ask questions cannot grow. New services and new businesses are born in companies that ask questions. In Silicon Valley, the issue of sustainability is ultimately an issue of innovation. If you don't always ask questions, you're instantly eliminated. Look at Airbnb's case. They were told to come to Silicon Valley for a conference, but it was so difficult to book hotels. And expensive too. Ordinary people would have said 'that's how it is, I'll have to pay more.' But the person who created Airbnb asked whether hotels are really the main option. Are there no other accommodation options? What new options could emerge in this environment? After asking themselves this and pitching a tent in the backyard for $20 [approximately $20 USD] per night, someone appeared to contract. They said for $20 [approximately $20 USD], a tent is fine and sharing a bathroom is okay. By continuing to ask questions like this, Airbnb was born. Is this business legally possible? Is the business model truly appropriate? Is it an appropriate solution for trends? Because they continued asking questions, a company was born and currently has 150 million users. Again, innovative ideas absolutely never come out without asking questions.\\n\\nUber is also such a case.\\nThat's right. There are various options like taxis or rental cars, but are these really the most appropriate options? They questioned it. They also caught the new sign that millennials don't buy cars. Because they asked appropriate questions at the appropriate time, appropriate solutions came out. Among companies that are now gone, there was a company called Blockbuster that rented videos. You'd go to the store, rent a video, watch it at home and return it, and if you didn't return it by the due date, you'd pay late fees. But when Netflix appeared, they promoted that they would eliminate late fees. Take one video, return it, and then you can watch a new video again. Wouldn't it be possible to watch as many videos as you want, with no late fees, return them when you want to return them, and take other videos too? Netflix was born by repeatedly asking such questions. So Blockbuster, the previous market-dominating company, was naturally bound to be eliminated. In short, Blockbuster was eliminated for not asking questions.\\n\\nHow should media industries or technology-related industries that are having difficulties these days innovate?\\nMedia or technology-related industries have quite fast clock speeds. So they need to ask questions more frequently and often. It can be said that the society we currently live in has changed into one that requires asking many questions. But in such a changed society, the less questions there are or the slower the questioning without asking quickly, the lower the question frequency - that is, the slower the clock speed - the further you get from sustainability and the more you're bound to be eliminated. Whatever industry, you can survive only by knowing what the clock speed is in that industry and always checking the question frequency, quantity of questions, and quality of questions that match it.\\n\\n'Clock speed' is one of the keywords Professor Paul Kim frequently uses. As he says, it's an era when companies with fast clock speeds succeed. Naver headquarters in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province [a city south of Seoul], reorganizes twice a month. This is because they proceed with work centered on projects. Even if projects fail, they don't hold members responsible and let them return to their original positions. They pursue such frequent changes to continuously create new services through collaboration between various departments due to the characteristics of information technology (IT) that is rapidly converging and combining. According to Professor Paul Kim's theory, Naver is a company with fast clock speed.\\n\\nIn an era where clock speed is emphasized, what kind of leadership should managers demonstrate?\\nThe role of leadership is to create a culture where people can freely ask questions within the organization and confidently share them. Because the person in a position to accommodate such questions is actually the organization's leader. But if managers, leaders, and employees have never studied such culture even at school since childhood? They face a state of leadership absence.\\n\\nIt's the same for countries. Countries where individuals can confidently ask any question without personal loss or threats to survival become sustainable countries pursuing innovation. If countries discourage questions and a culture forms where people can't question national leaders and worry about others' reactions, they cannot develop into countries that can innovate and lead proactive development. Whether schools, companies, or countries, they're all ultimately the same. Living as passive students in passive, rote memorization, non-questioning cultures, then working as passive employees and becoming passive leaders and passive citizens. They become schools in closed wells, companies in wells, countries in wells. Then clock speed slows and they gradually go bankrupt. Therefore, it's important to sustain a culture of questioning at the national level and at the pan-social level. To make them question, parents and teachers must lead children to learn such culture from first grade of elementary school. Only then can that child create such culture when entering companies later.\\n\\nI heard Korean companies visit you often. I heard there were many cases asking Professor Paul Kim about the next business opportunity...\\nThey do visit me, but actually I don't know the right answers well either. (Laughs) But there's something I always say when such requests come. 'What questions are you asking within your organization?' 'Please gather what questions employees, managers, administrators, and executives are asking.' 'Don't let only top executives ask, but have everyone from the bottom ask all questions, rank those questions, and crowdsource what you think is most important.' These are the advice I give.\\n\\nNo matter how low-level an employee, they'll have plenty to question, and that question could become one that plays a big role in determining the company's survival.\\n\\nWhat is the culture of global companies like?\\nIn Google's case, all employees use a system called Dory where they can freely ask questions. Even low-level employees ask freely without worrying about reactions. All employees can evaluate questions. By evaluating each other, the top questions are filtered out - whose questions are more important questions. It's a system where CEOs and other top officials directly and publicly answer questions that rise to the top through employee votes. This way, problems and ideas are quickly shared, sufficiently discussed, and responsible answers can be given. It's a desirable system and corporate culture.\\n\\nIf there's something in Korean culture you think should fundamentally change?\\nThe culture of fearing to try new things. In such organizations, rather than challenge or innovation, they watch other organizations innovate and then think 'let's copy that and try something.' Unfortunately, Korean society has been immersed in such culture since elementary school. The reality Korean companies are experiencing now stems from past wrong education. Again, cultural differences appear as innovation differences. If there's fear, innovation is difficult and change is difficult.\\n\\nSecond, the culture of fearing failure. Venture companies and startups also have different cultures between America and Korea. America values the experience of people who have various failures. They see success potential because there are lessons learned through failure. But in Korea, if you fail once, you become a dropout. You become a credit defaulter who can't get loans. That difference is big. The difference between starting a business anticipating 60 failures and thinking it's over if you fail even once is big. Entrepreneurs and founders cannot innovate if they have fear. Founders must escape fear of failure to think freely. Cognitively, brain activity significantly decreases when there's fear. But the moment they hear 'up to 60 times is okay,' students become free. This is the core of what I'm saying. When you become free, creative thoughts emerge and fear disappears. Because fear was eliminated, Stanford's clock speed is fast. They start businesses quickly, fail quickly, and quickly course-correct to try again. Then success probability becomes much higher. Actually, one female student I helped failed to receive investment for her startup item but received 14 billion won [approximately $10.5 million USD] investment on the 60th try. It's a success story I often tell students.\\n\\nProfessor Paul Kim's argument has basis. According to Lee Min-hwa, Chairman of the Creative Economy Research Institute, who recently wrote 'Korean Youth Entrepreneurship Will is World-Class' in JoongAng Ilbo [a major Korean newspaper], globally, new jobs have been created by ventures, with 4% of venture companies in America creating 60% of jobs. Large corporations contributed to growth but couldn't create jobs, and self-employment contributed to neither growth nor employment. Venture startups are the only alternative that both grows the economy and creates employment. Yet while 20% of American Ivy League university students have entrepreneurship will, only 3% of Korean university students do. This difference is the difference in national innovation capacity and quality jobs, according to Chairman Lee. But when Korean youth were asked differently about entrepreneurship will under the condition of 'not becoming credit defaulters,' the result surprisingly appeared as 20%, the same as America. Korean youth's hidden entrepreneurship will is world-class, but wrongly designed national policies are blocking startups, making youth choose the path of public service.\\n\\nTo cultivate creative employees, how should we change now, immediately?\\nWe must change from passive education to active education. We must create a questioning culture starting from first grade of elementary school immediately. First, 'awakened' parents should practice. Actually, I myself am someone who cultivates questioning culture. For example, I ask students 'As we rapidly change to the IoT era, what competitiveness will Google have and how can it survive?' I also ask 'Talk about the 5 most important questions we should ask Stanford within the next 5 years.' Deans, associate deans, and presidents share and discuss those questions with each other. And they answer important questions. Companies are the same. You must let them present ideas without fear, without risk. And you must give incentives to employees who bring good ideas. You must give performance bonuses, not take from others to give.\\n\\nWhat's the best method to increase the speed of innovation within companies?\\nTo maximize corporate capabilities, all executives and employees must share the company's founding philosophy, product philosophy, service philosophy and vision, and direction together. The company's mission and vision must be aligned in a straight line. In terms I use, you must always check whether value perception is aligned. The higher each company's Cohesion Ratio, the higher that company's stability and innovation. Conversely, the lower it is, the less growth and cohesion. If all executives and employees don't have one voice and one vision, that company's growth is bound to be slow. These are things always emphasized in Silicon Valley, at Stanford.\\n\\nReporter Na Kwon-il na.kwonil@joongang.co.kr · Photo by photographer Woo Sang-jo\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11176, "output_tokens": 4227, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

With one of the two major holidays, Chuseok [Korean harvest festival] (4th), followed by national holidays (October 3rd National Foundation Day, October 9th Hangeul Day), weekends, and substitute holidays, the government designated the gap day (2nd) as a temporary public holiday, making it so. Those who prepared diligently will enjoy a fulfilling vacation, but most ordinary people with empty pockets and no leisure time or mental space will be at a loss for what to do. When outing cars pour out, traffic conditions also become difficult, making it not easy to hit the road recklessly. There's a classy tavern worth entrusting an evening to on a leisurely day, so I'm introducing it for the holiday season. They say the moon that rises two days after Chuseok is the real full moon, so that day might be worth targeting.\\n\\nOctober Menu: Neungi [pine mushroom] galbi jjim, Korean beef suyuk, jumbo shrimp jang\\n\\n'Korean Tavern Eolssu (2nd floor, 136-3 Eoulmadag-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul / Tel. 02-333-8897)' is located midway on the path from Exit 8 of Hongik University Station to Seogyo Elementary School. It's a premium tavern equipped with generous and luxurious bar snacks that can substitute for meals and 50 types of traditional Korean liquor. There are about 20 bar snacks, with the main items changing slightly each month. The 'October menu' consists of three items: ▷Korean beef shank suyuk [boiled beef] (35,000 won [approximately $27 USD]) served with mature young cabbage spread on the plate bottom and just enough broth ▷Neungi Korean beef galbi jjim [braised short ribs] (40,000 won [approximately $31 USD]) with plenty of pine mushrooms ▷Jumbo shrimp jang + soy sauce egg rice (25,000 won [approximately $19 USD]) with 10 large shrimp soaked in seasoned soy sauce. The steady-seller bar snacks on the regular menu include ▷Bossam (35,000 won [approximately $27 USD]) with 500g of domestic female pork belly boiled and served with anchovy jeotgal [fermented fish sauce] (or cutlassfish intestine jeotgal) ssamjang [dipping sauce], pickled wild garlic, cucumber kimchi, and scallion kimchi ▷30cm (diameter) seasonal seafood vegetable pancake (25,000 won [approximately $19 USD]) ▷Korean beef naengchae [cold beef salad] (30,000 won [approximately $23 USD]) with 150g of grade 1 female beef chuck eye roll cooked and served with chives and chili soy sauce ▷Seasonal grilled fish (30,000 won [approximately $23 USD]) ▷Kimchi jjigae [kimchi stew] (25,000 won [approximately $19 USD]) with 200g of domestic female pork ▷Golbaengi muchim [seasoned sea snails] (25,000 won [approximately $19 USD]) ▷Dried bar snacks (25,000 won [approximately $19 USD]) consisting of beef jerky, dried pollack, and mixed nuts. For alcohol, there are 14 types of distilled liquor, 14 types of cheongju [clear rice wine], and 22 types of takju [cloudy rice wine] supplied from breweries nationwide. They also sell regular soju and beer.\\n\\nBusiness hours are 6 PM to 1 AM the next day (2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays), closed on Sundays. During this holiday period, they plan to close on the two Sundays and October 4-5, operating normally for the remaining six days.\\n\\nI'm a drinker, but when I go to 'Eolssu,' I'm more interested in the bar snacks than the alcohol. Every time I go, I'm curious about what ingredients they used this month and how they created the flavors. This is because the bar snacks are quite different from ordinary taverns. They're not the same old tavern snacks you can see anywhere. 'Cooking' comes out that's made with proper study, good ingredients, and formal preparation, comparable to food from authentic Korean restaurants. That's why I became a regular.\\n\\nA premium tavern where bar snacks are more anticipated than alcohol\\n\\nThe friendliness of young owner-chef Jo Seong-ju (33) and his generous food hospitality also attract people. When he's not cooking, he brings ordered drinks or bar snacks to the table while explaining various things. Content like the characteristics of the alcohol, how to enjoy the bar snacks deliciously, and choosing alcohol that matches the snacks. The bar snacks are good quality for the price and generous in portion like the chef's build. The '30cm seafood vegetable pancake' clearly shows this. It's not just wide in area. The thickness and the seafood and vegetables inside are generous. The batter is added just enough to keep the ingredients from scattering. It's reminiscent of the thick and large Chicago-style deep dish pizza famous for its thickness and size. But the texture isn't heavy. The outside is crispy and the inside is soft while the taste is light. Tables with several people don't miss this bar snack.\\n\\nOn evenings when it rains or snows, I reflexively think of this place. If I don't have special appointments, I set my way home in that direction. The front building is one story, and Eolssu is located on the second floor. When you open the wide windows like folding doors, the street scenery unfolds refreshingly. Imagine sitting by the window on rainy evenings listening to the sound of rain, or on snowy days following the traces of flying snowflakes, drinking good alcohol with delicious bar snacks. Even when it's not raining or snowing, the night view unfolding outside the window serves as a bar snack.\\n\\nKorean food and traditional liquor related events and happenings are also frequently held here. First, the 'Delicious Korean Food Imagination (Representative Kwon Yong-guk, CEO of Seoga-ne Sundae-guk, hereinafter Han-mat-sang)' meeting is held monthly. It's a gathering where active Korean cuisine chefs get together to study, build friendships, and share food and drinks. This month, the 23rd meeting was held for over three hours starting at 9:30 PM on the 17th with the theme 'Beopgo-changsin [learning from the old to create the new] Second Story - Rediscovering the Beauty and Value of Korean Cuisine.'\\n\\nYoung Korean chefs' study groups and events too\\n\\nOn the 11th, an event called the 'Bermuda Triangle Cooperative Project,' a collaborative planning by three famous Korean taverns in Seoul, was held. It's an event where three young chefs operating 'Eolssu,' 'Dameun (B1, Building 4, Banpo Shopping Town, 189 Sinbanpo-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul / Tel. 02-536-7500),' and 'Dudu (3-4 Dongsung 2-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul / Tel. 010-9119-1884)' gather to serve each other's signature dishes - gochujang jumbo shrimp, mukdeok fermented soybean paste, and grilled pollack roe with seasonal wraps and rice bowls - arranged on one table. The price is surprisingly cheap at 29,900 won [approximately $23 USD]. The triangle refers to connecting Hongdae area-Banpo-Daehangno [university district near Seoul National University]. The event continues on October 5th at 'Dameun' and November 12th at 'Dudu.' When I asked why they hold events when profits must be thin, they said promotion is a bonus, and the purpose is exchange, mutual verification, and idea sharing. They said it's an event to charge momentum for change when they feel their food has stagnated.\\n\\nOn August 30th, there was a pairing tasting of 'Baehyejeong Doga' [a traditional liquor brand] alcohol and 'Eolssu' food. Besides this, events like Christmas Eve Korean dinner courses with Korean traditional liquor, 'Spring Day Cherry Blossom Season Day Drinking' (Sundays) centered on spring vegetable bar snacks, cocktail and bar snack pairings, and tasting new traditional liquors are constantly held on weekends.\\n\\nI attended both the 'Cooperative Project' and 'Han-mat-sang' events and received drinking tables. The monthly 'Han-mat-sang' proceeds with a 60-90 minute lecture on a set theme followed by sharing traditional liquor and course meals. It's a paid event with membership fees (about 40,000 won [approximately $31 USD]). The meeting starts on Sunday evenings from 9-10 PM. It's a time when active chefs can gather after finishing business. They don't skip studying to break away from the reality of having no time to study due to being overwhelmed by work. The food is prepared by dividing the six-member management team into two groups, alternating every other month. They spend two months pondering like homework to prepare. This month, Group B, led by chef Jo from 'Eolssu,' was in charge.\\n\\nDiscussing Korean cuisine's beopgo-changsin and tasting new foods too\\n\\nThis month's study topic with about 20 people gathered was 'Korean Cuisine's Beopgo-changsin.' Food space director and film food director Kim Min-ji (39) gave the lecture. Representative Kim opened by asking, 'What do you think are the good points of Korean cuisine?' Various answers came out. Spreading out a world map, she said that the things cited as Korean cuisine's advantages exist everywhere on Earth, stating 'There is no originality in food culture by region or ethnicity.' Tension flowed across the faces of those who answered. She summarized the discussion by saying, 'I think the characteristics and value of Korean cuisine are yaksik-dongwon [food as medicine] and yin-yang and five elements.'\\n\\nBeopgo-changsin (learning from the old to create the new) is a new literary theory advocated by Yeonam Park Ji-won (1737-1805). Professor emeritus Jeong Ok-ja of Seoul National University (late Joseon intellectual history) annotated: 'If you become too obsessed with beopgo [learning from the old], there's a risk of becoming stale, and if you're only inclined toward changsin [creating the new], it becomes dangerous as you lose your foundation. This can be said to be a principle applicable not only to writing but to all worldly affairs.' (『What We Really Need to Know About Our Scholars』 2002. Hyeonam Publishing)\\n\\nWhen the lecture ended, course food prepared mainly by Chef Jo came out. Sweet pumpkin porridge topped with dried cranberries and dried fruits, spicy seasonal mixed vegetables with burdock root, young cabbage, spinach, cucumber, carrot, and onion mixed with chili oil, and fried back ribs followed. The fried back ribs was a menu considering the day's study theme of beopgo-changsin. Pork ribs were marinated in seasoning, coated in batter with rice grains stuck to one side and fried, then served on a plate mixed with cooked chestnuts and ginkgo nuts. They said it was a Korean interpretation of back ribs cooking. The sauce was a dip sauce made with sour cream enhanced with crab and shrimp flavors and mixed with cheese and tomato.\\n\\nNext came North Korean-style hangover soup. It was a soup dish boiled with white-leg shrimp, shiitake (very little), shiitake mushrooms, two types of oyster mushrooms, and bottle gourd in seafood broth. They replaced the originally used beef with shrimp. The seasoning sauce was made by mixing and marinating salted shrimp, red pepper powder, and cheongyang peppers. The soup initially had a refreshing taste, but became very sharp after adding the seasoning sauce. For the croaker gulbi jjim [steamed croaker], they poured matcha broth sparingly to remove the fishy smell and steamed it topped with roughly chopped wild sesame leaves from the ends of autumn perilla stems.\\n\\nFinally, radish rice and dandelion jang came out. It's rice cooked by mixing soaked rice with cooked shredded radish. Radish rice is difficult to get the water ratio right, and the rice was mushy that day. The bibim soy sauce was fragrant with chopped dandelion leaves and chives mixed in. For dessert, there was omija [five-flavor berry] syrup applied from sujeonggwa [traditional cinnamon punch] and assorted seasonal fruits. It was a cool taste with sweet, sour, and cinnamon flavors harmoniously blended by soaking seasonal fruits - Korean melon, melon, grapes, and figs - in a cup containing juice made by mixing water boiled with cinnamon, omija syrup, and lime (or lemon) juice.\\n\\nSolidly built industry foundation in 3 years and 3 months\\n\\n'Eolssu,' which opened in 2014, has just passed 3 years and 3 months in business. I've been frequenting it for a little over 2 years. I'm close enough with Chef Jo's mother to be considered quite a regular. But I've never seriously listened to his story. Using the article as an excuse, I met him for lunch on the 23rd. He came out carrying a bag of scallion kimchi as a greeting. That thoughtfulness was lovely. When I left the location choice to him, he picked 'Eulji Myeonok' [a famous naengmyeon restaurant]. It was the second time we had a meal together, and we ate naengmyeon [cold noodles] both times. We ordered bibim naengmyeon [spicy mixed cold noodles] and jeyuk [spiced pork] and mixed them with extra seasoning. While eating, the meat was left over and the noodles weren't enough, so we added extra bibim noodles. We used that as a side dish and drank one bottle each of red-capped soju. For palate cleansing, we also had a bowl each of mul naengmyeon [cold noodle soup]. After finishing the meal, we moved to my office and continued the conversation. We went back to 'Eolssu' to take pictures and drink. After 12 hours and 30 minutes of accompanying and listening to his story, I grasped the storyline.\\n\\nAlthough born in Daejeon where his maternal relatives lived, he grew up traveling around the country following his father, who was a soldier. Just the places he remembers include Jindo, Gangwon Province's east coast, Yongin, Suwon, Anyang - about 8-9 regions. For food, Jindo and the east coast come to mind. His mother's family was a wealthy family in Daejeon. His father's hometown is Imcheon-myeon, Buyeo, Chungnam Province. Imcheon, which was the outskirts of Buyeo's Sabiseong [ancient Baekje capital], is a fertile plain area developed along the Geum River about ten li (4-5km) ahead. It was a countryside rich in natural resources, facing Ganggyeong Port where fishing boats from the seas off Gunsan used to come up and unload cargo.\\n\\nAfter graduating high school in 2002, he took the CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] three more times but had no connection with university. He told another reporter, 'I found what I wanted to do. I thought there was no need to go. If necessary, I can go later' (Hankyoreh Seoul& 'Places Park Mi-hyang Goes' May 19, 2016). After helping with work at the hagwon he attended, he completed military service as an active reserve from the end of 2004 to December 2006. He was among the first to benefit when service was shortened from 28 months to 24 months. After discharge, he taught students at a hagwon from 2007 to 2009. Around that time, the social issue of celebrities' false academic credentials was ongoing. Issues also arose at the hagwon regarding 'Teacher Jo Seong-ju.' His dream was to become a star instructor, but he concluded it was realistically impossible. It was also a time when his concerns about the mismatch between what he wanted to do and what he was doing deepened. He sought a new path.\\n\\nNot entirely smooth conclusion of his twenties and starting a business\\n\\nIn 2010, he went to Japan to find his cousin who was a branch manager of a Korean company. He did work helping Korea-Japan connections for about 4 months. He was dissatisfied with working in too rigid a framework. He wanted to do work where rewards came back proportional to effort. When working at the hagwon, compensation came back that way. After returning to Korea, he considered trying business. His maternal uncles were in the restaurant business. Making and supplying convenience store products for 'Jangchung-dong Wangjokbal' [a famous pig's feet restaurant] was one of his uncle's businesses. He thought it would be fine to do such business.\\n\\nWhile considering what the right item would be, the makgeolli [traditional rice wine] boom hit. He liked alcohol and was very interested. He looked into whether there were traditional Korean soju and cheongju. Books were rare, but even when available, the contents were varied. Knowing that materials were scarce, he visited breweries. He wandered around for about a year to master craftsmen's workshops and yakju [medicinal liquor]/soju production facilities. He went to almost all of Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces. When he went with difficulty and listened to stories, they hid too much about alcohol, and regarding food, they only emphasized following tradition. In the case of Songhwa Baekil-ju [a traditional liquor], since it's monks' alcohol, they spoke of bland side dishes excluding meat as if it were an iron rule. It was noticeable that they didn't consider the harmony between alcohol and side dishes. He thought that high-proof distilled liquor would go well with meat or rich side dishes. He decided to make side dishes that match alcohol himself. This was the starting point of stepping into the culinary world.\\n\\nHis maternal cousin who ran a tavern in Daejeon moved the business to Seoul in 2012. He came to work there. Initially, he didn't intend to take charge of the kitchen but aimed to learn for his own business. He was told that to know everything, he had to know the kitchen, so he took on kitchen work. Curiosity about alcohol led him to dig deeper, and the center shifted to curiosity about the harmony between alcohol and side dishes. He entered the field directly and picked up a knife without prior education. He literally started headbutting the ground. With only ingredients for making set side dishes, he couldn't try the foods he wanted to make. It was frustrating.\\n\\nHe wanted to handle sashimi. He went to find an academy and attended an intensive 3-day course. While considering attending more lectures, he decided to buy fish with that money and practice instead. That's how he learned. Next, he went to learn Chinese cuisine. He liked Chinese food. He quit work and only attended the academy. It was a 6-month course, but he skipped theory and begged to take only 2 months of practical classes. He liked using the wok and still frequently uses it for Korean cooking. He didn't look for Korean cuisine because most were certification classes. He studied focusing on practical food making. At the end of 2013, he moved to 'Wine Tavern Chacha.' It was a bistro chain advocating wine and Korean food. While helping with food work, he attended wine classes to study.\\n\\nFood and alcohol study process: zigzagging and crisscrossing\\n\\nAfter bouncing around between alcohol and food like a rugby ball for just 2 years, learning through physical confrontation, he opened 'Korean Tavern Eolssu' at the current location on June 26, 2014. His mother Kwon Yeong-sim (60), who dearly loves her only son, found the location and took care of food and operations from the beginning. Following the principle of handling Korean traditional liquor, he selected alcohol that suited his taste. Initially, he set alcohol prices from a consumer's rather than business owner's perspective, selling at ridiculously cheap prices. Nearby businesses greatly disliked it, saying he was dumping.\\n\\nWith so many types of alcohol handled, he had to provide explanations about the liquor. He talked about which region's alcohol it was, how it was brewed, what it tasted like, and what characteristics it had. But customers would often say the taste wasn't like that after trying it. When tasted, it was different from what he knew. The explanation was wrong. Tracing the cause, breweries were often at fault. Quality didn't come out consistently each time alcohol was brewed. It's relatively stable now, but just 3 years ago, there were quite a few breweries that had recently started learning and producing.\\n\\nHe thought he needed to know the alcohol-making process. He went to learn from Park Rok-dam, director of the Korea Traditional Liquor Research Institute. He studied for one month. He quit because his thoughts about alcohol didn't match. He went to find Ryu In-su, director of the Korea Home Brewing Research Institute, to learn again. Later, he also took various classes at the Korea Brewing Research Institute run by Dr. Lee Yun-hee, considered a disciple of the late Chairman Bae Sang-myeon (1924-2013), founder of Kooksundang, and National Tax Service liquor education. Unable to grasp which was real, he tried listening to various classes to make judgments. In the final stage of Director Ryu In-su's home brewing research institute classes, he came to study ancient documents. While taking classes like Joseon Dynasty humanities, he learned that fermented foods like alcohol, vinegar, jang [fermented sauces], and kimchi are all neighbors within one fence. It became an opportunity to enter deeper study.\\n\\nBrewing 100L monthly for alcohol study... distilled liquor practice too\\n\\nThen he went to find Han Yeong-seok, director of Suwon's vinegar specialist fermentation research institute. Having cured spinal cord inflammation with fermented vinegar, he researched alcohol that becomes the raw material for vinegar, and while directly treading nuruk [fermentation starter] to brew good alcohol, he's systematizing fermentation. Director Han's teaching was the transmission of living knowledge gained through experience. He came to understand why traditional liquor should go this way. He continues learning while using nuruk from there when brewing alcohol once a month.\\n\\nFrom when he first learned alcohol from Teacher Park Rok-dam in 2014, he studied through physical confrontation, saying 'You only know by trying.' He learned while brewing directly, making failure his teacher. For about 2 and a half years, he brewed two types of alcohol monthly using eight 30L jars. From this year, he brews once monthly in a 100L stainless steel container. The alcohol quality clearly improved after taking classes at Han Yeong-seok's fermentation research institute. His thoughts about alcohol seem to have been organized.\\n\\nDuring this time, he's tried brewing Seoktan-ju, Baekhwa-ju, Yeonyeop-ju, and Oyang-ju, and also experimented with yellow plum wine, bokbunja wine, aronia wine, yagwan-mun wine, galhwa wine, and herb wines fermented with nuruk. Since brewing alcohol in 100L containers requires 6 months of aging for strained alcohol but there's no suitable place, he's also doing distillation practice these days. He tried making Igang-ju [a traditional distilled liquor]. It's not the traditional method of using soju-gori [traditional distillation equipment] but using a purchased home-use simple distiller. On the day 'Han-mat-sang' was held, he poured about 10mL of Igang-ju into a glass for tasting, and when held in the mouth, it properly produced the feeling of distilled liquor spreading warmly. Previously, he often offered brewed alcohol to customers for tasting, but it's decreased recently. He said since offering brewed alcohol to customers for tasting made alcohol sales poor, he now only shows tastes in small amounts.\\n\\nWhen opening 'Eolssu,' he leisurely thought he could just make set items for food. Actually doing it, the more he did, the more there was to touch, and when he thought he knew something, he immediately saw what wasn't right, and walls were everywhere. He went through countless trial and error from cutting frozen meat to properly cutting refrigerated meat. He likes beef jerky and makes it directly to serve as a side dish, but the amount of meat wasted before making it properly was indescribable. 'If I had to start over, I don't think I could do it. Now I know that experience is the best teacher,' he said.\\n\\n'What are Korean cuisine's characteristics?' - Question receives new eyes opened\\n\\nStarting with the intention to do what he likes and enduring for 4 years with his body while running down one path, one day in 2015, a bamboo stick flew at his back. Food space director Kim Min-ji asked, 'What are Korean cuisine's characteristics?' He had never thought about it. He couldn't answer. It was shocking. He came to face fundamental questions about what he knew about Korean cuisine. He realized he was very lacking. He eagerly looked for books and whenever he had time, he visited senior chefs to ask. He especially relied heavily on Chef Park Seong-bae, chief researcher at 'Onjium' [a Korean cuisine research institute]. He visited many times. Even now, when something interesting comes up, he takes it there. He seems to go about once every two months.\\n\\nShocked then, he accelerated his Korean cuisine studies. He started joining his mother when making jang or kimjang [kimchi-making season] at home. While learning, ultimately most of it would be used at 'Eolssu.' His mother has good cooking skills. She makes jang and kimchi well, and especially has good skills at seasoning food. Her method of explaining soybean paste making is unique: 'When separating jang to mix soybean paste, grind and add barley rice and chili seeds, boil white beans until very soft, mix everything including the water without discarding it, knead and put in a jar for aging, and the soybean paste will ripen to a golden color.' The son is inheriting such details.\\n\\nIn 2015, he also took classes at Uri Jang Academy run by culinary researcher Go Eun-jeong in Jirisan's Gyeonbul-dong and Sempio's jang fermentation class held at year-end. From April to August this year, he studied Korean cuisine at Han Bok-ryeo's Royal Cuisine Research Institute. There are levels from beginner, but with Chef Park Seong-bae's recommendation, he entered the advanced class directly. From July, he's studying traditional aristocratic cuisine weekly with Lee Mal-sun, a disciple of the late Professor Kang In-hee (1919-2001), who was an authority on aristocratic family cuisine, at 'Korean Flavor Research Society.' She teaches only a small number of people at her home, and with many people wanting to learn, he waited as a standby and entered.\\n\\nBusiness performance is barely making personal wages\\n\\nDue to the atmosphere and food influence, customers are mostly office workers in their 40s and above. Young people in their 20s-30s are about 30%. Since Korean cuisine is the keynote, the food is distant from the new generation's taste starting from ingredients. The cuisine Chef Jo pursues is modern Korean cuisine. 'I try to base it on Korean cuisine but not be old-fashioned. Fish jjim doesn't necessarily have to use fish broth. I want to use meat broth or chicken broth to approach from different perspectives and create new flavors. I want to do Korean cuisine where I directly prepare everything from jang to kimchi and all seasonings. I want to become a chef who can control the entire process of Korean cuisine.'\\n\\nHe doesn't operate during the day because he goes out to study alcohol and food. Thanks to studying and working hard, the industry recognizes him quickly compared to his years of operation. He was appointed as a judge for the 2015 Korean Wine Evaluation and won a silver prize in the Munbae-ju [a traditional liquor] category of the Korean Liquor Competition. Last year, he received a gold prize in the individual exhibition category at the Asia Master Chef Competition.\\n\\nWhen I asked if he makes some money, he passed the break-even point after one year of opening but barely makes wages. This doesn't count the wages of his parents who help almost daily until late.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 12527, "output_tokens": 6991, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Real estate experts say government policy alone can never control Gangnam housing prices. Why is this the case?\\n\\nScene One. On February 2nd last year, at realtor A's office in a shopping complex in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul. When I pulled the door handle, it was locked. As I was about to turn away, an employee peeked out, looked me up and down, and guided me into the office. They apparently mistook me for a Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport enforcement officer. Banpo-dong was one of the areas with very large apartment price increases over the past year-end period. I asked if there were any apartments around 84.94㎡ (25 pyeong [Korean unit of measurement]) that middle-class families of 3-4 people prefer.\\n\\n\\\"There are no properties at all. Right now people are anxious, so (homeowners) all say they won't sell.\\\" They said homeowners are anxious because they don't know what government policy will be. Among homeowners who put properties on the market and then withdrew them, some say things like \\\"We held out during the Roh Moo-hyun era too, so what... Let's see how long we can hold out.\\\" With that kind of confidence, they could be wealthy 'big players' in the industry with financial power rather than homeowners with just one house. According to experts, the floating real estate funds currently in the market exceed 1,000 trillion won [approximately $750 billion USD]. As long as reconstruction apartment investment returns exceed financial sector and stock market investment returns, a considerable portion of these funds will inevitably flow into real estate.\\n\\n\\\"Even homeowners who put houses up for sale withdraw them when it comes to actually signing contracts (due to greed for money). Asking prices have risen a lot more due to fewer people putting properties on the market than due to traded prices rising.\\\" What are the market prices? They said a 26-pyeong apartment built 5 years ago costs 1.75 billion won [approximately $1.3 million USD]. Even then, you have to wait since there are no properties available. Similar-sized older apartments cost 1.7 billion won [approximately $1.27 million USD], while new apartments cost 1.9-2 billion won [approximately $1.42-1.5 million USD]. Ten years ago, an old Korea National Housing Corporation apartment in Banpo-dong cost 700 million won [approximately $525,000 USD]. Even then it was big money. Since then, prices have jumped 2.5 times.\\n\\n\\\"Aren't there any cheaper lower-floor units?\\\" \\\"Lower floors, upper floors, they're all the same price. If you don't have money, you can't buy a house in Gangnam.\\\" This sounded like saying that now not only ordinary citizens but even decent middle-class people can no longer dream of entering Gangnam.\\n\\nScene Two. Through an acquaintance who knows the real estate industry well, I found Mr. B who works in real estate brokerage one block away. He's a practical person who shrewdly purchased multiple reconstruction-target apartments over ten years ago. He borrowed names from university seniors, juniors, and acquaintances based on personal relationships, paying hundreds of thousands of won [approximately $750-3,750 USD] per person. The reconstruction apartments he purchased this way now cost 1.8-1.9 billion won [approximately $1.35-1.42 million USD] each. While Mr. B outwardly runs a shabby brokerage office, he's essentially as wealthy as any small-to-medium enterprise president. In fact, it's industry practice for real estate capitalists with financial power like Mr. B to make money.\\n\\nAccording to Mr. B, Banpo Korea National Housing Corporation apartments have been and remain attractive investment targets. They're blue chips in the real estate market, so supply is always tight. At Banpo Raemian Prestige, an 84.94㎡ exclusive area unit was recently contracted for 2.3 billion won [approximately $1.72 million USD]. That's over 80 million won [approximately $60,000 USD] per 3.3㎡ (1 pyeong). A year ago, the same size apartment traded for 1.6 billion won [approximately $1.2 million USD]. It rose by a whopping 700 million won [approximately $525,000 USD]. That's more than the price of a decent apartment in Gangbuk [northern Seoul]. Acro River Park, also a reconstructed apartment, traded at 2.29 billion won [approximately $1.72 million USD] for 84㎡ in November last year. This was a 600 million won [approximately $450,000 USD] increase from the previous year. Banpo-dong brokers show these examples in graphs to 'customers' and 'madams' who come from all over the country.\\n\\nAccording to Mr. B, even within the same Banpo-dong area, asking prices vary greatly. Banpo Complex 3, a reconstruction-scheduled complex that hasn't selected a construction company yet, is subject to excess profit recovery after reconstruction. Trading prices for 72㎡ exclusive area units only reach 1.8-1.9 billion won [approximately $1.35-1.42 million USD]. In contrast, Banpo Complexes 1, 2, and 4, which finished selecting reconstruction contractors at the end of last year, are apartments not subject to the excess profit recovery system implemented from January this year. An 84㎡ exclusive area unit asks for 3.4-3.5 billion won [approximately $2.55-2.63 million USD]. That's over 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] per 3.3㎡. Even so, there are no properties available. It truly makes you gasp at the 'hundreds of millions.'\\n\\nWhy are asking prices so high? Isn't speculative false demand driving housing prices up too much? Mr. B explained it this way:\\n\\n\\\"Reconstructed new apartments are what people call 'new products' these days. They're smart apartments equipped with cutting-edge features like artificial intelligence. Since they're new products, being expensive is natural. When homeowners set high asking prices, you have to consider that they've calculated additional contributions that association members must pay, 600-800 million won [approximately $450,000-600,000 USD] in burden according to the reconstruction excess profit recovery system, scheduled comprehensive real estate taxes, loan principal and interest burdens, and estimated amounts for future value. When the government pours burden payments onto housing prices, those burden payments ultimately get reflected in market prices. They can't help but be expensive.\\\"\\n\\nWhen I said \\\"Still, they're too expensive,\\\" Mr. B drove the point home as if I didn't know what I was talking about. \\\"These days, Banpo students don't go to Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] (hagwon district). They've created Daechi-dong hagwons within Banpo. The area around S Apartment has now become a hagwon district. They've scouted all the high-paid instructors from Daechi-dong to Banpo-dong. You have to consider the current value of premium residential environment plus educational premium, and future value that enables real estate investment with returns higher than bank interest rates. Gangnam reconstruction apartments are profitable business even when bought expensively.\\\" Although the government announced a strong excess profit recovery system, Banpo-dong, where prices had already risen to the limit, seemed unaffected. Rather, it was building higher fortress walls.\\n\\nThe next day, this time I visited Jamsil apartment complexes. Jamsil, which became a forest of buildings through reconstruction projects like Jamsil Park Rio and Jamsil L'S, has literally undergone a complete transformation. Especially after Lotte World Tower was built, it became one of the residential areas most preferred by the middle class. Throughout Jamsil area, many real estate brokerage offices had their doors closed. Even those with doors open uniformly waved their hands saying they had no properties. I found one brokerage office among them. Units with 84.94㎡ exclusive area were trading in the 1.25-1.3 billion won [approximately $937,500-975,000 USD] range. Market prices were lower than Banpo-dong.\\n\\nWhile inquiring about market prices and consulting, the brokerage office owner's mobile phone rang. Suddenly lowering his voice, the conversation lengthened. From the mobile phone, sounds of \\\"It can't be less than XX hundred million won...\\\" flowed out. The brokerage office owner said \\\"I understand, madam! I'll confirm when we go to see the house\\\" and hung up the phone.\\n\\n'Housing price collusion' was suspected. In Gangnam, homeowners sometimes engage in housing price collusion as they worry that rapidly risen housing prices might fall. At the end of last year, an elevator in a reconstruction-planned apartment complex in Songpa-gu had a notice posted by the 'XX Housing Price Protection Campaign Headquarters' saying 'Gangnam is raising housing prices by 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] every week through collusion, and our complex has also resolved not to sell houses for less than XX hundred million won.' After resolving housing price collusion at residents' meetings, management office presidents and women's associations sometimes closely cooperate to 'manage' the range of trading prices. When homeowners urgently need to sell and put out bargain properties by lowering selling prices, absurd situations occur where they're urged to withdraw properties citing apartment complex market price declines. There are cases where people receive reprimands from women's association executives for calling out low asking prices. The myth of 'Gangnam invincibility' is not achieved for free.\\n\\nAs a result of on-site reporting, although the government has introduced all sorts of policies to control Gangnam housing prices, Gangnam locally remained unmoved. Armed with abundant liquid funds released into the market, it was building Gangnam's unique solid fortress. To buy Gangnam blue-chip apartments as investments, 1.7-2.2 billion won [approximately $1.27-1.65 million USD] is needed for 84.94㎡ exclusive area. Raising funds through mortgage loans has become unrealistic. To withstand cases where housing prices temporarily fall due to rapid changes in the global economy requires considerable capital, making it difficult to own Gangnam apartments without substantial financial power. Now Gangnam apartments are both housing for the wealthy and real estate investment targets. Entry barriers have become higher, and risk burdens have grown too large for middle-class people to jump in.\\n\\nExecutive K from an economic newspaper who has studied real estate for 20 years said this: \\\"Gangnam housing prices can never be controlled by government policy. This is because Gangnam housing prices aren't determined by Gangnam's demand and supply alone.\\\" Let's listen more deeply to his words.\\n\\n\\\"People who want to buy houses in Gangnam now aren't just Seoul residents. Anyone with some money throughout the country wants to establish roots in Gangnam. Or they want their children to live in Gangnam. That's not all. These days, global companies entering Korea also want Gangnam. Even if they get offices in Gwanghwamun, they want to get houses in Gangnam. With good school districts, convenient transportation, and comfortable living, who wouldn't want Gangnam?\\\"\\n\\nK's words reflected reality. Gangnam's transportation, education, economic, and cultural infrastructure overwhelms other regions. Combining on-site reporting with several experts' views, five factors were at work in the government's inability to control Gangnam housing prices.\\n\\nFirst, market principles. Basically, Gangnam apartments have high demand but insufficient supply. All housing in the Gangnam area totals only about 300,000 units. Demand for these 300,000 units is increasing continuously nationwide. According to real estate experts, Gangnam lacks land to build apartments, so supply must come through reconstruction. But the government regulates reconstruction, actually causing housing prices to soar. That policy is also causing confusion between government departments. When Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Kim Hyun-mi hinted at regulations saying \\\"We'll extend the possible reconstruction period from 30 to 40 years,\\\" Deputy Prime Minister Kim Dong-yeon expressed opposition saying \\\"If that happens, it could block even Gangbuk reconstruction.\\\" While government policy failed to give market confidence, speculative liquid capital flowed massively into the reconstruction market, only driving up housing prices. Homeowners withdrew properties they had put on the market, naturally raising asking prices. This has been happening since the end of last year.\\n\\nSome illegal elements also play a role here. It's the intervention of speculative capital. Real estate capital with abundant financial power competes to raise prices. There are also circular transactions. This is when large brokers artificially raise trading prices by buying and selling apartments they own to each other at high prices. This is also why the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport investigation team has begun strong crackdowns. In the real estate industry, it's common knowledge that if you have financial power, the more you buy and hold, the more money you make. During housing price upswings, how much money you make differs based on how many houses you own. It's a structure where money makes money. However, such speculative capital and circular transactions are partial factors in housing price increases. The government also acknowledges that supply is insufficient compared to demand.\\n\\nSecond, the psychology of owning 'one solid house' for real estate investment purposes has spread nationwide beyond Seoul and the metropolitan area. When the government warned multiple homeowners saying 'Sell by April if it's not a house you live in,' multiple homeowners sold apartments in the metropolitan area and provinces while keeping only Gangnam apartments, further fueling Gangnam demand. The case of Cho Kuk, then Blue House senior secretary for civil affairs, shows this. Secretary Cho owned two properties - S Apartment in Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu and K Apartment in Jwa-dong, Haeundae-gu, Busan (under his spouse's name) - and sold the Busan K Apartment at the end of last year. The recent market price of the Bangbae-dong 151㎡ exclusive area that Secretary Cho owns is about 1.3 billion won [approximately $975,000 USD]. He kept only 'one solid house.'\\n\\nThe psychology of owning one solid house stimulated the desires of provincial wealthy people, businesspeople, and local influential figures who own or want to own apartments in Gangnam and the Gangnam area. The case of Mr. S met at a real estate brokerage office illustrates this. He retired as a principal in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, and has two children. His eldest son and daughter-in-law are both doctors. The apartment where the son currently lives is in Seocho-dong, which Mr. S arranged by selling a house in Jeonju he had prepared to give to his son when the son opened practice in Jeonju, adding cash to this. The son and daughter-in-law recently moved to a commercial district in Wirye New Town built in Songpa-gu when the rent for their rented Gangnam hospital clinic rose. Mr. S said \\\"I told my son not to sell the Seocho-dong apartment\\\" and \\\"These days, wealthy people around me often say they need to arrange at least one house in Gangnam for their children.\\\"\\n\\nA recent petition posted on the Blue House public petition board titled 'Minister Kim Hyun-mi, please resign' includes content pointing out \\\"The government seems not to have predicted the phenomenon of ultra-polarization toward 'one solid house' when only multiple homeowners are treated as corruption and whipped.\\\" The argument is that the stronger government regulations become, the more severe Gangnam concentration and housing price polarization between Seoul and provinces become.\\n\\nThird, Gangnam housing prices are linked to hagwons, the greenhouse of hagwon education, and school districts. According to real estate experts, in Korea, college entrance exams and educational issues have an inseparable relationship with Gangnam housing prices, and recently, preference for Gangnam school districts has strengthened further due to changes in government education policy such as abolishing autonomous private schools. Seoul's top-tier universities have been selecting students from autonomous private schools, foreign language schools, and science schools through early admission programs. After early admission programs are completed, mainly CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) high scorers have been accepted. But the situation changed when the Moon Jae-in administration announced plans to abolish autonomous private schools. Daechi-dong, which has prestigious private schools like H High nearby, began drawing attention from parents again.\\n\\nDaechi-dong's effectiveness is confirmed by actual parent cases. The case of Mr. Y (54), a domestic corporate executive, is like this. He moved to Gangnam for 5 years for his child's education. Originally living in a new town apartment, he moved to Gangnam when his son entered H High. He sold his new town apartment and rented in Daechi-dong. Mr. Y's wife quit her side job to support their son commuting between school and hagwons. The son was accepted to prestigious K University's business administration department after retaking CSAT. Afterwards, Mr. Y and his wife withdrew their Gangnam rental deposit and found an apartment near Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu. This is a familiar case of Seoul middle-class parents becoming 'educational nomads.' It's common to send children to hagwon education in Daechi-dong and Mok-dong hagwon districts for middle school even if they attend elementary school near their residential apartments. This is why housing prices around Daechi-dong won't fall unless Seoul creates another Gangnam School District 8.\\n\\nFourth, existing residents also don't want to leave Gangnam. Mr. K (61), who lives in Jamwon-dong, is an adjunct professor at a metropolitan area university. The apartment he lives in is about to undergo reconstruction. The trading price exceeds 2 billion won [approximately $1.5 million USD]. From the apartment, Seocho IC and Express Bus Terminal are very close. Gangnam St. Mary's Hospital is nearby, and living convenience facilities like Shinsegae Department Store and JW Marriott Hotel are well established. Having only daughters, he plans to continue living in Gangnam even after his children marry. He has enough spare money to bear additional contributions as an association member. Among his acquaintances, some moved to areas like Yongin Dongbaek District for retirement life but then returned to Gangnam. The reason is that with hospitals and schools concentrated in Seoul, Seoul is more convenient for meeting children. Real estate expert Mr. G said \\\"Moving Gangnam residents to metropolitan areas like Hwaseong and Dongtan by reducing acquisition and transfer taxes could be one way to lower Gangnam housing prices.\\\" However, considering residents' Gangnam preference psychology, this method's effectiveness would inevitably be limited.\\n\\nGangnam is no longer Seoul's Gangnam. It has already become a global brand beyond the domestic level. The 'one solid house' psychology is accelerating Gangnam concentration, with Seoul's middle class, provincial wealthy people, and even existing Gangnam residents all uniting to make Gangnam an iron fortress. Of course, distrust of government officials plays a part here.\\n\\nFifth, critics point out that Seoul City's housing policy has further strengthened Gangnam preference psychology. Democratic Party lawmaker Woo Sang-ho recently mentioned Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon's responsibility regarding causes of Gangnam housing price increases. He pointed out \\\"Last year, reconstruction permits for apartments in Gangnam's 4 districts were issued intensively. Even when approving reconstruction, the Seoul mayor should have issued permits sequentially, divided slowly with intervals.\\\" This is the so-called 'Park Won-soon responsibility theory for Gangnam housing prices.'\\n\\nAccording to real estate experts, Seoul City's 'Yeongdong-daero Underground Space Complex Development Project' announced last year also influenced Gangnam preference psychology and housing prices. According to the basic plan Seoul City announced in June last year, Seoul City announced it would create a complex transfer center and large-scale underground facilities under Yeongdong-daero between Samseong Station on Line 2 and Bongeunsa Station on Line 9 by 2023. Using the Greater Seoul Area Express Railway (GTX) entering Samseong Station as an opportunity, they will create a 6-basement-level multipurpose space. Above ground, a 105-story massive Hyundai Motor Global Business Center (GBC) and a large plaza from the old Korea Electric Power Corporation site to COEX will be built. This is a large-scale project costing over 1 trillion won [approximately $750 billion USD] with a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled for around May 2019. Gangnam residents mostly welcome the Yeongdong-daero underground development. Banners hang on Gangnam-gu main roads reading \\\"<Congratulations> Yeongdong-daero 'Heaven and Earth Transformation' Level Development Plan Confirmed. Underground: 30 times Jamsil Baseball Stadium size 'Underground City.' Above ground: Large plaza 2.5 times Seoul Plaza size.\\\"\\n\\nMs. P, a housewife in her 50s living in Yeoksam-dong, said \\\"Many people say Gangnam will become more prosperous when the underground city is developed. They say housing prices will rise further.\\\" In fact, a domestic agency for a foreign law firm moved its office to a nearby officetel that will face the Hyundai Motor Global Business Center. They quickly secured a position anticipating Gangnam's expansion potential. In Seoul, which has grown into an international business city, Gangnam is both an office building and high-end residential area preferred by global businesspeople.\\n\\nSo is there no way to control 'Gangnam housing prices'? Experts believe Gangnam housing prices cannot be controlled with temporary policies. They argue that the more the government intervenes, the more the market becomes distorted, only resulting in market price explosions. In fact, housing price polarization between Seoul's expensive and cheap apartments has deepened further as prices centered on Gangnam reconstruction apartments surged over the past year-end period. For this reason, they say the government should not regulate Gangnam reconstruction but leave it to market principles for the time being. Leading Gangnam housing price explosions are new apartments with good residential environments or reconstruction-target apartments scheduled for new construction in a few years. Golden apartments in areas like Dogok-dong that were noisy in the past maintain relatively stable prices after going through several years of adjustment periods.\\n\\nThe logic of increasing supply remains. Instead of suppressing Gangnam housing prices, the argument is to create a 'second Gangnam' or Gangnam alternative areas by supplying farmland around Gangnam, areas not fully utilizing farmland efficiency, or Seoul's Gangbuk regions. Arguments for first presenting measures for Gangnam-Gangbuk balanced development before talking about national balanced development are in the same context. However, supply alone is not a panacea given that Gangnam housing prices continued rising despite the government diligently supplying Gangnam alternatives like Bundang, Pangyo, and Wirye. Political circles believe the government will ultimately have no choice but to use comprehensive real estate tax cards if it becomes obsessed with controlling housing prices. The Democratic Party has decided on imposing 1% comprehensive real estate tax when it exceeds 1.2 billion won [approximately $900,000 USD] for single-house households and 900 million won [approximately $675,000 USD] for multiple homeowners. However, it's unknown whether the ruling government party will implement comprehensive real estate taxes that could worsen public sentiment ahead of elections. Related to this, some urge changes in the binary thinking of some government officials who view multiple homeowners as corruption or social evil. A figure in his 50s with deep experience in Yeouido political circles said \\\"Power has already moved to the market. Unless the Moon Jae-in government is a revolutionary government, it won't be able to beat the (real estate) market.\\\"\\n\\nTo achieve the government's desired policy objectives, it must ultimately take the direct approach. The point is to work with experts to create real estate policies that fit actual reality and sophisticated policies targeting actual users, solving supply shortage problems and devising various demand dispersion measures. The forecast is that Gangnam housing prices will be difficult to rise significantly for the time being.\\n\\nReal estate expert Mr. P from KB Kookmin Bank said \\\"From now on, it will be a money fight, a defense fight. The psychology is similar to not wanting to lose in auctions.\\\" The psychological battle has begun between forces trying to maintain Gangnam invincibility and the government trying to control Gangnam housing prices. Can the Moon Jae-in government indeed break the myth of Gangnam invincibility?\\n\\nReporter Na Kwon-il, Monthly JoongAng\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11525, "output_tokens": 5913, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Did you have fun playing with friends and read books you wanted to read? Did you spend the day without hearing or saying discriminatory or comparative words about other friends? You might wonder why these random questions. Well, they're all related to the rights you have as children. You might ask what rights little kids could possibly have, but around you are peers working to protect children's rights. Let's meet these friends and hear their detailed stories now. Article by Kim Hyeon-jeong, reporter hyeon7@joongang.co.kr, Photos by Lim Ik-soon (Open Studio)・Kim Hyeon-jeong reporter・Children's Rights Self-Guardians・Youth Feminism Group, Illustrations・Materials by Children's Rights Self-Guardians・Children's Report Writing Team, Joint reporting by student reporters Ji Na-hyeon (Yonggang Middle School 1st year, Seoul)・Choi Chi-won (Geulbeot Middle School 1st year, Sejong)\\n\\nWhether male or female, poor or rich, regardless of country and ethnicity, everyone has the right to live as a human being. This is called human rights. However, the recognition of children and adolescents' human rights hasn't been around for very long. The first attempt to view children and adolescents not as subjects of relief or protection but as subjects with human rights was the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child announced in 1959. Later, in 1989, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was created, which legally recognized children as subjects of rights and guaranteed legally binding children's rights.\\n\\nSouth Korea ratified (agreed to) it in 1991, becoming a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This convention is international law that binds the member countries, and these countries have an obligation to implement it and must report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on how they are protecting children's rights. At this time, not only countries but also NGOs and children submit reports. It's an opportunity to let the world know how well or poorly the government is protecting my rights.\\n\\nThere are many issues related to children's rights that children in South Korea face. UNICEF Korea compared the results of a children's rights survey conducted in 2017 among 17,446 children in 14 UNICEF Child Friendly Cities with results from a survey conducted by UNICEF France. They divided children's rights into six areas: play and leisure, health and hygiene, safety and protection, living environment, education, and participation and citizenship, with the biggest difference in 'participation and citizenship.' While only 18% of Korean children answered that they had 'heard about children's rights,' 60% of French children responded positively. To the question 'I can participate in activities to make my community better,' 6% of Korean children said yes compared to 60% of French children, and to 'Local councilors or mayors in my area ask for my opinions about my life or our community,' 4% of Korean children said yes compared to 46% of French children.\\n\\nRegarding the survey results, UNICEF Korea's Children's Rights Department stated, \\\"Korean children appear to lack opportunities to develop their opinions through participation according to their developmental stages, and there seems to be insufficient social atmosphere for children to experience having their thoughts reflected in actual decision-making processes.\\\" Nevertheless, there are children who stand up to protect their rights. They pointed out problems currently faced by South Korean children through the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, informing the world whether the country is protecting children's rights well and urging improvement. The report with children's participation will undergo preliminary review in February and be used as main reference material during the South Korean government's main review in September. UNICEF Korea's Children's Rights Department explained, \\\"After the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child meets with the government, recommendations called 'Concluding Observations' are published. While there's no mandatory enforcement, if more people know what the government should do for children, it can add more strength to help the government act on the recommendations.\\\"\\n\\nOn November 21, 2018, children held a press conference at the National Assembly Press Center in Yeouido, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. The protagonists were the child writing team who created the '5th and 6th National Report on the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in South Korea' (hereinafter 'Children's Report'). The writing team consisted of 23 people who wished to participate from the 'Children's Rights Self-Guardians' (hereinafter 'Guardians'), established to enable children to actively express opinions on issues affecting their lives and protect their own rights. A total of 394 children aged 10-18 nationwide participated as Guardians from 2015 to 2017 with help from the International Child Rights Center, UNICEF Korea, and Green Umbrella Children's Foundation.\\n\\nThe writing team compared the three-year Guardian activity report with the 5th and 6th National Reports on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, organizing various cases of children's rights violations. Under the main theme 'Children Suffering from Education,' they divided it into five subthemes: health, rest, and leisure; civil rights and freedoms; public education; educational gaps; and college entrance systems, creating and submitting the Children's Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.\\n\\nAccording to the Children's Report, South Korean middle and high school students' annual study time is 2,097 hours for middle schoolers and 2,757 hours for high schoolers, longer than adults' average annual working hours of 2,069 hours. Due to the perception that studying is a student's duty, the social atmosphere targeting prestigious university admission, and the education system, many hours are spent studying. Kang Ga-hyeon (Ara Middle School 2nd year, Jeju), who participated in the writing team, said, \\\"Looking at the subtheme 'health, rest, and leisure,' there's content about having too much study time and wanting to eat dinner with family. I also come home after 9:30 PM, and after eating and studying, I sleep after midnight even when it's not exam period.\\\" Park Ji-young (Wonju Girls' High School 2nd year, Gangwon-do) added, \\\"I spend more time studying at school than at home, and even the little time I have at home is mostly spent studying instead of resting, which is painful.\\\"\\n\\nNot only middle and high school students but also elementary students and preschoolers' study time is increasing, leading to insufficient sleep and exercise time, and naturally, the right to play is not guaranteed. Looking at survey content from 1,472 children and adults conducted by the writing team: \\\"During exam periods, I have to study, do performance assessments [school-based assessments, not standardized exams], manage grades, and attend hagwons, so there's not much leisure time,\\\" \\\"Parents are obsessed with grades, and people doing arts and physical education are busy practicing, but grades need to be not just average but excellent to succeed, so the burden prevents the right to play from being protected,\\\" \\\"Due to job shortages, people think they need to attend good universities to get jobs, and this problem causes excessive academic fervor, making many parents want their children to only study.\\\" Children identified adults' stereotypes (50.9%) as the most important factor that needs improvement first to guarantee the right to play.\\n\\nLooking at the National Report, the enrollment rate for elementary, middle, and high schools reached 90% in 2016. While public education greatly affects children's quality of life and future, there's a tendency to recognize grades as more important values than individual students' characteristics and qualities, creating significant grade pressure. Ji-young said, \\\"I felt it was so unfair that individual capabilities are ignored and everything is standardized through studying, so I wanted to express my opinion on this and participated in the writing team. What I'm good at and what I like are unnecessary content in current South Korean society.\\\" Kim Gyeong-uk (Michuhol Foreign Language High School 2nd year, Incheon), who continued by saying \\\"It feels like living mechanically according to a set schedule,\\\" said, \\\"Rather than looking forward to what I'll do tomorrow, I get stressed about the hagwon schedule that will be the same as always.\\\"\\n\\nPark Seung-hyeon (Munjeong Middle School 1st year, Daejeon), who became a writing team member after three years of Guardian activities, pointed out, \\\"It's also a problem that most school classes are pre-learned through hagwon education [In Korean context, 사교육 refers specifically to the hagwon/tutoring industry].\\\" The government enacted the Special Act on the Promotion of Public Education Normalization and Regulation of Preliminary Education in September 2014 and established the 'Measures to Reduce Hagwon Education and Normalize Public Education' in December. According to the writing team's survey results, 261 out of 660 students responded that 'hagwon education is necessary because schools conduct classes assuming preliminary learning.' Many children also felt they suffered and were discriminated against due to the grade-oriented college entrance system.\\n\\nLim Su-yeon (Hwangji Girls' Middle School 2nd year, Taebaek), who said \\\"At first, I didn't think the college entrance system had much connection to children's rights,\\\" explained, \\\"Through writing team activities, I learned about the actual situation of children whose rights are violated due to the college entrance system and education.\\\" According to the writing team's survey results, 47.7% of children responded that they had suffered mental pain due to the grade-oriented college entrance system. Looking at the breakdown by school level, 13.3% were elementary students, 41.3% middle school students, and 73.5% high school students, showing that stress increases as students advance to higher grades. Ga-hyeon said, \\\"The college entrance system that ignores individual characteristics must change,\\\" hoping for the disappearance of the atmosphere where universities seem to be students' final goal.\\n\\nThe writing team, who included the domestic children's rights violation situation and recommendations to the government in the Children's Report, identified school violence, expansion of student human rights ordinances, lowering the age for education superintendent election participation, and age and gender discrimination issues as areas they hoped would be resolved quickly beyond education. They unanimously agreed to continue monitoring and finding ways to improve so that South Korean children can escape from suffering even after the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's preliminary review in Geneva, Switzerland in early February and beyond. They also recommended that more children should take interest and directly participate in activities.\\n\\nSu-yeon, who emphasized that \\\"There's no one in the world who has never been a child, and children's rights should rightfully be protected to prevent oneself or those around them from suffering unjust human rights violations,\\\" concluded with these words: \\\"I always heard people say 'What can a little kid do,' but there are things that can be done as a child, or because one is a child, and I'm proud that I can do such work. You can protect your own rights yourself. Dear Jungang Student Central friends, if you have opportunities to act as children, please definitely try it.\\\"\\n\\nWhat was the most mentioned keyword in the social sector of SNS (Social Network Service) Twitter in 2018? It was School Me Too. Second was feminism, third was hidden cameras. The Youth Feminism Group, which has been conducting the School Me Too movement exposing school sexual violence issues, held a launch press conference for the 'School Me Too Goes to UN' campaign at Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul on January 4, announcing they would visit the UN to inform about the School Me Too situation. They were invited by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child after submitting an 'NGO Report on Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse of Children (#School Me Too)' to the UN in November last year. Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that children must be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Jungang Student Central student reporters Ji Na-hyeon and Choi Chi-won met with Youth Feminism Group steering committee member Yang Ji-hye and high school student activist Kim Na-yoon, who have been active in School Me Too and feminism-related activities.\\n\\nNa-hyeon: Please introduce the representative activities of the Youth Feminism Group.\\n\\nJi-hye: The Youth Feminism Group is a female youth group formed in May 2016 following the Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] Station misogynistic murder case. We conduct various projects including the 'Now We Want to Learn Gender Equality' cultural festival, Daughters' Feminism Project, school sexual violence survey, seminars on sexual commodification remarks, and youth feminism reporter corps. We also held the 'There's No School for Female Students' rally last November. Recently, we went to the UN and talked about School Me Too through the 'School Me Too Goes to UN' campaign. A School Me Too nationwide rally is also planned for February 16.\\n\\nChi-won: Is there a particular reason you focused on school sexual violence issues?\\n\\nJi-hye: When I was a high school sophomore, the Sewol ferry disaster happened. Going through that, my concerns about youth human rights grew. Everyone has at least one memory of casual violence or evaluating women jokingly at school. Isn't it strange to say 'be careful' rather than 'we'll catch and punish those taking hidden camera photos'? While pondering such thoughts, I formed the group after graduation.\\n\\nNa-yoon: Since I'm still a student, I'm very interested in problems occurring at school. Schools should be the safest spaces, but the reality that they're not makes me think 'this isn't right, something seems wrong,' leading me to speak out.\\n\\nNa-hyeon: What constraints or difficulties did you face during activities? Since these are activities fighting against the world, were there times when you felt scared?\\n\\nNa-yoon: Being a student is definitely the hardest and scariest part. Even now I worry about being photographed. The school might view it negatively. While being a student makes it easy to get peer empathy, it also affects not being able to be more active. There's also the surrounding perspective of 'you don't need to go that far, why do you have to do it.'\\n\\nJi-hye: What's good about becoming an adult is being able to say things I couldn't say as a student. But accusations still continue, and even when things become public, many cases end with light apologies or calling perpetrators good people. Accusers risk a lot to make accusations. Some friends can't accuse because it's difficult to testify with real names, so when it ends with simple apologies, it's quite difficult.\\n\\nNa-yoon: It's scary when I think what if the world ultimately stays the same.\\n\\nNa-hyeon: It's been a year since School Me Too started, but articles say not much has changed. What aspects are particularly like that?\\n\\nNa-yoon: A lot has changed too. At first, an atmosphere was created where everyone paid attention, thought, spoke, and was careful. However, as the Me Too movement continued, people got used to it, avoided things that seemed like their responsibility, and actually turned it around saying it's being too sensitive. There are definitely changes, but instead of maintaining that state, people try to go back because it's more comfortable.\\n\\nJi-hye: Last year, School Me Too was the most tweeted word on Twitter. At the November rally, students directly came forward to create the event, and about 10 accusers came to the streets to speak. They rose up overcoming difficult times, pledged solidarity, and this wave spread to local areas including Incheon and Chungcheong. But there's a feeling of going backward. In the case of Yonghwa Girls' High School, nearly 200 students including graduates testified that sexual violence occurred, but the perpetrator teacher recently received a non-prosecution decision. Schools aren't actively addressing teachers' secondary harm. Government measures don't contain fundamental solutions.\\n\\nNa-hyeon: You received an invitation from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding School Me Too. In some ways, it seems like international society acted before our government.\\n\\nJi-hye: We demanded four things through our statement: conducting comprehensive surveys on sexual violence like school violence, mandating feminism education for teachers according to changed gender sensitivity, reforming the privately operated private school law, and active investigation by prosecution and police. With related ministries like the Ministry of Education being lukewarm, we hoped this would become a point to inform international society and remind domestically again. How we could come here, what kinds of harm and struggles existed in schools, and despite that, students continue speaking, gathering all those voices to convey and receive strength from international society.\\n\\nChi-won: There's talk that feminism is going too much toward taking sides, and many people view it negatively.\\n\\nNa-yoon: I've heard such talk too, but I think people only see the surface of movements that appear intense. People don't say civil rights movements for Black people or disabled people are taking sides. Because minorities are the parties whose rights are violated. Feminism is a women's rights movement. However, there's the question of whether women are minorities. For example, they say women's beautiful appearance is power. But usually, others judge what's beautiful. It's power that can be taken away anytime. There are many cases of excluding women due to possible pregnancy in wage gaps or career interruptions. Compared to 100 years ago when women's suffrage movements were happening, things have improved, but I think women are still minorities. Looking closely, you think about who's really dividing sides. In the end, I think we have no choice but to continue studying and taking interest.\\n\\nJi-hye: I think it's the influence of worriers increasing as feminism spreads. It's necessary to empathize with the pain of women who had to remain silent until now.\\n\\nChi-won: Feminism isn't about dividing men and women into sides but about eliminating gender discrimination. Just because someone is male doesn't mean they need to view feminism negatively. There should also be movements to correct prejudices.\\n\\nNa-yoon: By today's common sense, slavery doesn't make sense. At one time in America, people conducting slavery abolition movements were called social evils. Eventually, those who went all the way changed society. I hope the era comes soon when people doing feminism movements and Me Too movements now are recorded in history.\\n\\nChi-won: If you have future resolutions and things you want to say to Jungang Student Central friends, please share them.\\n\\nNa-yoon: I hated hearing 'it'll end when you go to college, just endure a little.' Being active as a student was difficult at first, but I gained strength thanks to friends. Colleagues who show solidarity. There's a school feminism club that started with 3-5 people and grew to about 50. I get excited thinking about this year's activities. It's about fighting together with the will to live the life we want to live and creating shining moments. I want to learn more and become someone who can help others.\\n\\nJi-hye: After hearing about a friend's victimization during adolescence, I thought it would be good if there was something we could do besides saying it's not your fault and crying. I continued asking questions about finding my position in a system where someone has no choice but to die - students committing suicide due to grade pessimism, accidents including Sewol ferry, etc. Speaking out on the streets, doing interviews - these aren't the only activities. Just thinking you want to do something and having a supportive heart is doing wonderful work. I think last year proved that one person's courage gathering together can change the world. I want to join in work that changes the world.\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10415, "output_tokens": 4610, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

'Minjok Leadership Academy' Faces Crisis of Closure\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"High school equalization was introduced in 1974. The state took away private schools' right to select students. Since then, so-called 'prestigious high schools' disappeared. The idea of autonomous private high schools (hereafter 'jasago') emerged as a way to complement excellence-oriented education. It was proposed during the Kim Young-sam administration and introduced under the Kim Dae-jung administration.\\n\\nMinjok Leadership Academy (民族史觀高), established in 1996 by former Pasteur Dairy chairman Choi Myung-jae (92), was included among six pilot schools for self-supporting private high schools, the predecessor to jasago, along with Sangsan High School, Haeundae High School, Ulsan Hyundai Cheongun High School, Pohang Steel High School, and Gwangyang Steel High School. Minjok Leadership Academy can be seen as pursuing a 'genuine private school' in Korean soil. It aimed to become a world-class private school like Britain's Eton School, America's Phillips Academy Andover, and Choate Rosemary Hall High School. He sought to embed the ideals of ethnic identity education, gifted education, and leader cultivation in this school.\\n\\nLater, through high school system reorganization under the Lee Myung-bak administration, the number of jasago increased. It reached a maximum of 46 schools, including nationwide student recruitment jasago (10 schools) and regional student recruitment jasago (36 schools).\\n\\nThen in 2017, when the Moon Jae-in administration took office, the direction of education policy changed significantly. The direction was to 'normalize' jasago, foreign language high schools, and international high schools, excluding only science high schools and gifted schools. Regarding this, foreign language high schools, which are mostly public and receive substantial state support, are in no position to raise their voice. The government is heading in that direction without necessarily using the term 'jasago abolition.'\\n\\nThe government has several policy tools to tighten jasago's breathing room.\\n\\nFirst is adjusting reauthorization evaluation standards to be more stringent. In fact, each metropolitan and provincial education office raised the reauthorization standard score from the previous 60 points to 70-80 points. In the reauthorization evaluation standards, social integration admissions (admission of socially disadvantaged groups such as children of National Basic Living Security recipients or near-poor households) were set at a maximum 14% ratio. These are measures that can be implemented when educational philosophies align from the Blue House to the Ministry of Education to metropolitan and provincial education offices. In fact, in the nationwide election of 17 superintendents of education held in June 2018, progressive or moderate-leaning figures were elected in 14 regions excluding Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Daejeon. It's a structure where government intentions can almost permeate.\\n\\nHowever, this isn't necessarily always the case. Conversely, conservative-leaning superintendents are highly likely not to follow the Blue House and Ministry of Education line. The Gangwon-do superintendent is classified as progressive or moderate-leaning, but the Gangwon-do Office of Education lowered the social integration admission ratio for the regional jasago Minjok Leadership Academy to 4%. This is understood as a decision quite different from the government's policy direction of reducing jasago.\\n\\nAdditionally, the government is implementing policies to delay jasago student selection timing to coincide with general high schools, and to limit entrance exams to interviews only without written tests. Regarding the change in student selection timing, nationwide jasago including Minjok Leadership Academy, Sangsan High School, and Ulsan Hyundai Cheongun High School have filed constitutional appeals and are awaiting decisions.\\n\\nJasago reauthorization evaluations are conducted every five years. Minjok Leadership Academy, located in Hoengseong, was scheduled to undergo reauthorization evaluation by the Gangwon-do Office of Education in May 2019. If it fails to achieve a passing score in this evaluation, Minjok Leadership Academy could, in the worst case, close its doors. Vice-principal Han Man-wi said, 'Minjok Leadership Academy has nowhere to return to. Because it's not a school that was converted from a general high school.'\\n\\nBroadly speaking about jasago but narrowly about Minjok Leadership Academy, polar opposite frames exist. It's clearly divided between 'a school that made high school entrance more of a war than college entrance' (Kim Eun-jung, senior researcher at Hagwon Education Without Worry [사교육걱정없는세상]) and 'a national pride included among the world's top 20 prestigious high schools' (Yoon Jung-il, former Seoul National University College of Education dean).\\n\\nThe reason for spotlighting Minjok Leadership Academy among jasago is because of this school's unique story and orientation. Only after knowing that trajectory can one fully evaluate Minjok Leadership Academy.\\n\\nFounder Choi Myung-jae poured 100 billion won [approximately $75 million USD] into this school, including his private fortune. Wealth and power have disappeared, and only this school remains. His health condition is known to be such that the flame of life is flickering out. While the world is forgetting him, Minjok Leadership Academy, approaching its 25th anniversary since establishment, is running toward uncertainty. An unprecedented sense of crisis has been circulating since its opening in 1996.\\n\\nI wanted to hear how founder Choi is accepting the reality that the tower built with his life's work faces an existential crisis. However, interviews were difficult due to health concerns. Instead, I heard testimonies from his son, Choi Kyung-jong, administrative director of Minjok Leadership Academy, and school officials. Like his alter ego Minjok Leadership Academy, Choi Myung-jae's life also crossed boundaries between glory and disgrace.\\n\\nBorn in Gimje, North Jeolla Province in 1927, Choi Myung-jae came to Seoul in 1946. He worked as a bank employee for seven years starting in 1953. Then in 1960, he suddenly changed careers to become a taxi driver. He was the eldest son among four sons and two daughters. Six siblings with their spouses and children all lived in one house. It was thought that Choi Myung-jae entered the taxi business to support the large family's livelihood. This is Director Choi's memory: 'There's an elementary school in Gimje. My grandfather made it during Japanese colonial rule by joining forces with neighborhood people. We went on a family trip, and my father stopped by the school and gave scholarships to elementary students. I think my father harbored passion for education from this time.' Choi Myung-jae was separately saving part of his taxi income.\\n\\nDirector Choi confessed, 'When I was young, I had no father.' From middle school, he rarely came home. Director Choi said, 'At that time, I vaguely felt I couldn't depend on my father. That feeling continued, so I decided to live as 'father is father, I am me.'' The son worked briefly at his father's company, Pasteur Dairy, in 1988. However, he clashed with his father and left within less than a month. They lived apart for more than 10 years. 'I ran a small business. I wanted to contribute to changing the world in a good direction. But one day I saw that my father was already practicing this first.' News of Minjok Leadership Academy's establishment had reached him.\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae entered Iran by chance in 1974. Judging there was potential in the transportation business, he bet his life on overseas logistics transportation. He made quite a lot of money and got out before the Khomeini revolution occurred in Iran. Luck followed him. Repeated success gave Choi Myung-jae self-confidence. After returning to Korea, he ventured another industry change to ranch business.\\n\\nIn his 2004 memoir [You Speak After 20 Years], Choi Myung-jae said:\\n\\n'Education is not a money-making business. The moment you think of education business as 'business,' only 'business' remains and 'education' disappears. ... To establish a school like Britain's Eton School, the school must be free from money. For the school to be free from money, the foundation must be solid. For the foundation to be solid, it must be backed by clean, profitable enterprises, preferably enterprises with strong public interest. I must build such enterprises. While looking for such business, I finally thought of ranching.'\\n\\nGangwon-do Hoengseong Seongjin Ranch was born this way. And in 1981, Choi Myung-jae went to Japan and encountered 'low-temperature pasteurized milk.' After a six-year preparation period, Choi Myung-jae established Pasteur Dairy in 1987. On September 7 that year, Pasteur milk made its debut. Pasteur milk waged a so-called 'milk war' with existing dairy companies that made ultra-high temperature instant pasteurized milk. This war ironically raised Pasteur milk's recognition. It continued rising, with sales increasing tenfold within a year of launch.\\n\\nWhen the milk business got on track, Choi Myung-jae presented another goal, saying, 'I am a merchant. Since I've started business, I intend to do big business.' He set out to 'create a school that doesn't exist on earth' that would cultivate leaders by combining gifted education and ethnic education. He wrote in his memoir, 'If I made money, it's nothing more than society temporarily entrusting money to me and allowing me the opportunity to use it properly. Having been entrusted with money from society, I bear the obligation to use that money efficiently for the most appropriate purpose.'\\n\\nAfter operating Myungjae Haksa [학사] for two years from 1992, he received approval to establish Minjok Leadership Academy in October 1995. Director Choi Kyung-jong evaluated, 'My father's boldness was like a runaway locomotive. People found it difficult, but because of that, Pasteur Dairy and Minjok Leadership Academy achieved memorable accomplishments.'\\n\\nVice-principal Choi Gwan-young came to Minjok Leadership Academy through a teacher recruitment notice in December 1995 and has been working there ever since. 'I interviewed at the Pasteur Dairy Seoul office that was then in Sinnae-dong. At that time, Korean, English, and math teachers were paid three times that of general public schools, and other subjects twice. The conditions were good, but I was 28 years old then. I was curious about the appearance of a new school.' Minjok Leadership Academy required teachers to submit even copies of elementary school records. When asked why later, the answer came back: 'Teachers who teach outstanding children must have thoughts and capabilities from childhood.' They only hired teachers with master's degrees or higher.\\n\\nIn its early days, Minjok Leadership Academy used the space next to the laboratory on the second floor of the Hoengseong Pasteur headquarters factory as the teachers' office. The current Minjok Leadership Academy building was completed only on January 3, 1996.\\n\\nMinjok Leadership Academy opened on March 1, 1996. This was because of Choi Myung-jae's 'stubbornness' that 'one cannot grow into a leader of the nation without the March 1st Movement spirit.'\\n\\nIn its early days, teachers at Minjok Leadership Academy struggled more than students. Having taught 50 students in one class, trying to provide individualized education to 1-5 students was actually better adapted to by foreign teachers. A small number of students (30 total students in the first year), many teachers, and state-of-the-art equipment were provided. Overhead projectors and electronic blackboards were installed, and Pentium-class computers were provided to all students. Not only tuition but also dormitory and meal costs were free.\\n\\nThe school building was built in hanok [traditional Korean house] style. Students wore hanbok [traditional Korean clothing] as school uniforms. They also wore traditional samo [hats]. English, math, and science classes were conducted in English. Initially, when teachers struggled, they were sent abroad for education. Professional instructors were brought in to teach English to teachers at night. Now English use has changed from mandatory to recommended. Corporal punishment also existed. Initially, founder Choi Myung-jae directly administered corporal punishment with a switch. After Lee Don-hee, former Minister of Education, took office as principal of this school in 2003, corporal punishment disappeared.\\n\\nThe biggest conflict in early Minjok Leadership Academy arose from differences in educational views between Choi Myung-jae and teachers and parents. Vice-principal Choi Gwan-young's testimony: 'The founder once asked, 'Do you know why I hired you?' He said, 'I hired you because you were less tainted by general schools.'' Choi Myung-jae pushed that to completely change children, teachers must change first. Some field teachers rebelled, saying their teaching authority was being violated. Conflicts with parents were also inevitable. Choi Myung-jae thought Minjok Leadership Academy's education was not for Seoul National University admission. Choi Myung-jae's direct speaking style made the situation worse. Within a year, 19 of 30 students left. 20 of 28 teachers were replaced.\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae was a 'lone wolf' but had a personality of immediately correcting when he thought something was wrong. Early Minjok Leadership Academy had classes from 7 AM to midnight. Even Sundays weren't rest days. Sunday morning religious activities and going home one day every two weeks were the only rest. Vacation was only 10 days. However, when he changed his thinking that there should be time for recharging, contemplation, and exploration for true gifted education, programs were modified. Vice-principal Choi said, 'Even now, Minjok Leadership Academy has a relatively low ratio of entrance exam-oriented education such as Korean, English, math, and CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] problem-solving education.'\\n\\nThe IMF economic crisis hit Korea in November 1997. Pasteur Dairy, Minjok Leadership Academy's lifeline, went bankrupt in January 1998. Having focused on high-quality, high-priced dairy products, sales plummeted when customer purchasing power fell. Imported raw material prices rose. With the financial sector collapsing, fundraising became difficult.\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae took full responsibility for the bankruptcy and withdrew from management. However, he returned in May that year at the request of financial creditors. The only condition for return was 'continuing support for Minjok Leadership Academy.' Later, in October 1998, a composition application for temporary debt repayment suspension was accepted. Minjok Leadership Academy completed an 11-story dormitory in 2000. Choi Myung-jae moved into the 10th floor of this building and lived closely with students.\\n\\nPasteur Dairy was sold to Korea Yakult in 2004. It was later sold again to Lotte Foods in 2010 and continues to this day.\\n\\nRegarding Pasteur Dairy's bankruptcy, listening to Minjok Leadership Academy officials' opinions, two main perspectives existed. One was 'He spent more time on school than company. If he hadn't invested 100 billion won [approximately $75 million USD] in Minjok Leadership Academy and had promoted Pasteur milk instead, sales would have been different.' The other was 'Regardless of Minjok Leadership Academy, Pasteur Dairy had systemic limitations.' Because the owner's intentions were absolute, it was efficient, but once a wrong decision was made, it became uncontrollable.\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae's confidence from repeated success didn't accept others' methods. Choi Myung-jae confided in his memoir, 'I brought CEOs from Hyundai and Samsung, but it didn't work well.' Pasteur Dairy was essentially a one-man company, not systematic management. Paradoxically, such factors enabled Minjok Leadership Academy's birth. If there had been procedures like board resolutions, such 'reckless' investment would have been difficult.\\n\\nIn July 2000, Choi Myung-jae stood at the boundary between life and death. He was burned while on vacation in Jeju Island. The hotel sauna's temperature control device had malfunctioned, filling the bathtub with hot water. Unaware of the situation, Choi Myung-jae jumped in as usual and suffered 85% total body burns. This meant an 85% probability of death. While receiving treatment at Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital, sepsis occurred. Director Choi recalled, 'In a dream, someone tried to take my father away, but he shouted 'No.' My father was in a coma for a certain period.'\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae was hospitalized until winter. When consciousness miraculously returned, he instructed Director Choi from his hospital bed to 'report on school affairs.' The first place Choi Myung-jae visited immediately after discharge that winter was Minjok Leadership Academy. Director Choi's memory:\\n\\n'As soon as he came, he said he would observe classes directly. But his physical condition made it difficult then. For burn treatment, he needed to lie still. During hospitalization, my father's entire body muscles had atrophied, and his joints had stiffened. Three Pasteur Dairy staff members got my father out of the car and seated him in a wheelchair. Then he went around the campus and teachers, observing classes. After finishing, we had to put my father back in the car and take him to the school dormitory, but my father found it difficult even to bend his body. In that cold winter, my father sweated profusely trying to move his body. Watching that scene, I could feel my father's will.'\\n\\nHe confessed that he still finds it difficult to accept his father Choi Myung-jae. However, after seeing that day's scene, he came to recognize and respect at least educator Choi Myung-jae's sincerity.\\n\\nChoi Myung-jae had words he repeated like a habit: 'I absolutely don't do losing business.' So his son initially thought Minjok Leadership Academy was also marketing for Pasteur Dairy. 'My father set up a very large stage for Minjok Leadership Academy. Everything at school was top-grade. Initially, students were accepted completely free. I thought he was a great merchant discussing the nation's future with Minjok Leadership Academy. But seeing my father coming to school and suffering even after the burn, no matter how bad our relationship was, I felt my father's sincerity. Even I, his child, had doubted, but I came to understand my father's sincerity. My father operated Minjok Leadership Academy not to make money but to achieve his ideals.' After this, Director Choi urged his father to 'never come down to school again and focus on healing (since I'll do well).'\\n\\nThe 'stubborn' father somehow listened to his child's words. Although his body wasn't healthy then, Choi Myung-jae's mind was clear. While staying on the 10th floor of the dormitory, he received rehabilitation treatment and walked on the school playground. He still received reports and gave instructions.\\n\\nMinjok Leadership Academy was completely separated from Pasteur Dairy in 2004. Minjok Leadership Academy, which had been entirely free, began charging dormitory fees during the composition period. Later, from May 2000, it changed to the beneficiary burden principle. Still, until 2004, there was support from Pasteur Dairy. However, after breaking ties with Pasteur Dairy, it faced a situation of complete independence. It even began charging tuition. At that time, rumors of large corporation acquisition circulated, but Minjok Leadership Academy ultimately chose the path of independent operation.\\n\\nAround this time, Choi Myung-jae left the dormitory and moved to Seoul. With burn aftereffects and old age overlapping, he had to go to Seoul where there were nearby hospitals. Still, Choi Myung-jae came to check on the school whenever possible. However, as time passed, his energy declined. Minjok Leadership Academy gradually prepared for the 'post-Choi Myung-jae era.'\\n\\nThe last image of Choi Myung-jae that Minjok Leadership Academy people remember was at the 20th anniversary commemoration event held in February 2016. He appeared in a wheelchair before faculty and students. He just watched and couldn't stay long before leaving. Since then, founder Choi Myung-jae hasn't appeared at official occasions.\\n\\nCan Minjok Leadership Academy be sustainable even without Choi Myung-jae? Perhaps this is a question that should be asked of politicians rather than Minjok Leadership Academy. Education policy is a very political area. Because it's a matter where one must choose one side between the conflicting values of diversity and equality and place weight there.\\n\\nVice-principal Han Man-wi said, 'From politicians' standpoint, supporting Minjok Leadership Academy can't generate votes.' Yoon Jung-il, former Seoul National University College of Education dean and former Minjok Leadership Academy principal, also worked at the Korea Educational Development Institute. He said, 'Even from Japan and Southeast Asia, when building private schools, they come to see Minjok Leadership Academy.' 'Minjok Leadership Academy entered as an official member of 'G20 High School,' the gathering of the world's most famous high schools. It's a national pride, but we shouldn't act jealous. If schools like Minjok Leadership Academy disappear, Gangnam [an affluent district in Seoul] middle school students will go abroad to study (rather than entering general high schools).' Professor Yoon said 'autonomy is key for private schools.' His thesis is that (since there's no state support for jasago anyway) well-performing schools should just be left alone.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Kim Eun-jung, senior researcher at Hagwon Education Without Worry [사교육걱정없는세상], takes this seriously. She noted the following reality, saying 'middle school students' per capita hagwon education [사교육] spending is higher than high school students': 'In Seoul alone, there are 204 general high schools but 23 jasago. The parental mindset is that our child should at least be sent to a regional jasago.' In that process, hierarchization of high schools occurs in the order of gifted schools, nationwide jasago, science high schools, foreign language high schools, regional jasago, and general high schools. Researcher Kim emphasized, 'Regional jasago tuition alone is around three times that of general high schools,' and 'nationwide ones can be even higher, potentially entrenching educational inequality where even academically excellent students can't enter without money.'\\n\\nFounder Choi Myung-jae shouted regarding Minjok Leadership Academy's reason for existence, 'You (graduates) speak after 20 years.' However, it seems much more time must pass—not 20 years since opening but much longer—to approach a proper evaluation.\\n\\nKim Young-joon, Monthly JoongAng reporter kim.youngjoon1@joongang.co.kr\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10906, "output_tokens": 5548, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It's not difficult to find 'essay-writing exam hagwon' signs in any decent hagwon district alley. Media companies sensitive to trends have also jumped in.\\n\\nFollowing media outlets like <Chosun Ilbo> and <Hankook Ilbo> establishing essay-writing academies outright, essay-writing hagwons run by former journalists are also thriving in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry]. Since mathematical essay-writing and language essay-writing appeared in the 2007 early admission process, math hagwons and social studies hagwons have also been changing their signs to 'essay-writing hagwons' and jumping into the essay-writing market.\\n\\nAccording to a report released by Daewoo Securities last April, the domestic hagwon education market size is 16.8 trillion won [approximately $12.6 billion USD]. Experts see about half of this flowing into the essay-writing market. Large essay-writing hagwons have annual revenues exceeding 10 billion won [approximately $7.5 million USD].\\n\\nThe essay-writing fever swept through hagwon districts nationwide last year. The catalyst was the Ministry of Education's announcement in early last year of the 2008 university admissions system, which would replace the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) with a grade system while increasing the weight of school records and essay-writing exams.\\n\\nThe essay-writing market, which only the top 3-5% of students aiming for Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University used to prepare for, expanded into a massive market that 30-50% of test-takers, and more broadly, even elementary school students, must prepare for. Particularly when major universities with great distrust of school records announced as a follow-up to the Ministry of Education's announcement that they would change essay-writing exams to integrated subject format starting from the 2008 academic year, the essay-writing market literally 'exploded.'\\n\\n01 Why Do Elite Instructors Flock to the Essay-Writing Industry?\\nRapid expansion from top 3-5% market to 30-50% market\\n\\nDemand for essay-writing courses has existed steadily since major universities revived entrance examinations in 1994. This was because while university-specific English and math entrance exams were banned starting from the 1997 admissions, essay-writing exams were permitted. Accordingly, an essay-writing hagwon boom had already occurred in the Daechi-dong area since the early 2000s. This was thanks to 'Daechi-dong ajummas [middle-aged women]' who early on grasped that essay-writing was key to getting into major universities.\\n\\nThe person who pioneered the blue ocean of the essay-writing market in Daechi-dong's hagwon district was the late Cho Jin-man, former vice president of Megastudy. In the 1996 university admissions, he correctly predicted 6 essay-writing problems from 4 universities—Yonsei University, Sogang University, Hanyang University, and Ewha Womans University—and became a 'pinpoint instructor [a teacher known for accurately predicting exam questions]' overnight. Even after contracting pneumonia, he was so busy with lectures that he had no time to go to the hospital, and died from overwork in September 2001 at age 32.\\n\\nThe first generation of essay-writing instructors includes Cho Jin-man as well as Lee Seok-rok (Megastudy evaluation director), Lee Man-ki (Yway Central Education evaluation director), and Cho Dong-ki (director of Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Specialized Hagwon). Most of these were instructors who had been teaching Korean and expanded their scope to include essay-writing.\\n\\nAt that time, since only some universities administered essay-writing exams, language instructors would teach mainly language areas until right before the CSAT, then focus on essay-writing lectures after the CSAT ended.\\n\\nHagwon instructors began jumping into the essay-writing market in earnest after 2000, when early admission processes became widespread. From around this time, it became possible to 'do business' for a full year with just essay-writing lectures.\\n\\nThe second-generation instructors who currently move the essay-writing hagwon scene following first-generation essay-writing instructors represented by Cho Jin-man, Lee Seok-rok, and Lee Man-ki include Park Hak-cheon and Yoon Seong-jin (Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon), Lee Yun-ho and Song Jae-hee (Choam C&C), Jang Min-seong, Park Su-rim, and Park Hong-soon (Eureka Essay-Writing Academy), and Kim Jae-in (Yway Central Education OK Logic Essay-Writing representative instructor).\\n\\nThese instructors also started activities around the same time as first-generation instructors, but as a result of focusing on the single field of essay-writing for the past 10 years, they are enjoying their heyday recently. Unlike first-generation leaders who competed based on individual star instructor capabilities, second-generation leaders are characterized by operating as teams or hagwons with established systems. Ahn In-sook, vice director of Apgujeong Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon, explains this as follows:\\n\\n\\\"Usually when we say star instructor, it has meant 'pinpoint instructor' until now. Instructor Cho Jin-man, who correctly predicted problems from 4 universities in the 1996 admissions, is a representative example. However, 'pinpoint prediction' is impossible and meaningless in current essay-writing trends. Particularly with integrated essay-writing being administered, this has become even more impossible. Eventually, as one instructor became unable to handle everything, which hagwon has a well-established system became the key.\\\"\\n\\nWhat's interesting is that Gangnam's essay-writing market has been dominated by hagwons created by people from the 386 [Koreans born in the 1960s who were politically active in the 1980s democracy movement] student movement background.\\n\\n02 Korea University Student Movement Gathering Place 'Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon'\\nTrying to help juniors make a living led to corporate-style operation with 28 directly managed branches...\\n\\nThe instructor who started as a first-generation Korean instructor and has maintained a solid position in the essay-writing market to this day is Cho Dong-ki, director of Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Specialized Hagwon. Director Cho, class of '85, is a so-called 386 student movement alumnus who served as executive chairman of Korea University's student council.\\n\\nHe was also passionate about theater, active as a member of Korea University's theater club 'Drama Society.' His entry into the hagwon market was also to raise money for office relocation costs for the 'Seoul Film Collective' he had joined after graduation to make independent films.\\n\\nWith his handsome appearance and voice that once made him dream of being a movie actor, he quickly rose to become a popular instructor. From being a part-time instructor at a small supplementary hagwon in Asia Athletes' Village, he became a representative instructor at Gangnam's Daeil Hagwon in just 5 years by 1994.\\n\\nDirector Cho summarizes his secret to success as follows:\\n\\n\\\"Basically, CSAT language areas and essay-writing subjects match well with student movement backgrounds. Particularly, student movement alumni systematically studied classics and humanities/social sciences through countless seminars and discussions during university life. In my case, I also learned artistic trends through drama society activities. Since I studied most of the passages that appear in CSAT language areas in their original texts, it had to be easy for me. Among my university classmates, I'm probably the person who best utilizes what we studied in college.\\\"\\n\\nIn the late 1990s, he rose to the ranks of Gangnam's top star instructors in Seoul's Gangnam hagwon district alongside Son Ju-eun for social studies subjects and Lee Beom for science subjects. In 1998, he handed over Gangnam Daeil Hagwon, which he had almost single-handedly built, to Megastudy CEO Son Ju-eun, then established Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Specialized Hagwon with Lee Chang-ki (pen name Hong Chi-san), known as the 'fool class president,' and became independent. CEO Son Ju-eun, who acquired Gangnam Daeil Hagwon from Director Cho, grew it into today's Megastudy.\\n\\nRegarding rumors that \\\"because the director is from Korea University's student movement background, Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon has many Korea University student movement alumni instructors,\\\" Director Cho says, \\\"It's a matter of how you define student movement,\\\" and \\\"The 1980s was a time when everyone had to grow up fighting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Student movement alumni who were expelled from university or had prison experience didn't have many places to go even after graduating from university. Such juniors came to me often asking for introductions to hagwons they might know, since I was somewhat famous in hagwon circles. Among them, I kept the decent juniors to work together at our hagwon rather than sending them to other hagwons. So it's true that there are many instructors from Korea University's 'Drama Society' background.\\\" (laughter)\\n\\nHe also adds, \\\"Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon becoming a corporate-style hagwon with 28 directly managed branches wasn't intended from the beginning, but the business naturally expanded in the process of providing a foundation for juniors to make a living.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eventually gave up the dream of going into movies\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I planned to quit the hagwon and return to the movie industry when I turned 40. So I started preparing 5 years ago. I began establishing a system so the hagwon would run without any problems even without me. In that process, I brought in many juniors. But once the system was established, the problem of idle personnel arose.\\n\\nWhat I created to solve the surplus personnel problem were the Bundang branch that opened in 2002 and the Mokdong branch that opened in 2004. Our hagwon gives hagwon shares to instructors who have been here for more than 3 years.\\n\\nCho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Hagwon isn't mine personally, but a structure where instructors jointly own shares. For instructors with shares who want independence, we open directly managed branches for them. That's how we grew like this. If I had tried to prosper alone, we wouldn't have grown this much.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, at the end of this statement, he said, \\\"Four months ago, I gave up the path of movie acting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As the hagwon expanded, the name Cho Dong-ki became very burdensome. Students who come to our hagwon come looking at the name Cho Dong-ki. But if Cho Dong-ki himself isn't at the hagwon and is acting in movies, it would certainly damage the hagwon's credibility that had been built in the market.\\n\\nWhen opening the internet video site, I removed Cho Dong-ki from the site name and called it '1st Period.' The strategy was to carry both brands together for a while. From what I've observed so far, 'Cho Dong-ki' still works better than '1st Period.' In this situation, I can't abandon 300 teachers and staff who trusted and followed me just to fulfill my own dream, can I? So I shed tears and gave up my dream.\\\"\\n\\nInstead of giving up his acting dream, he decided to grow Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Specialized Hagwon more solidly. Following opening a directly managed branch in Beijing in April, he plans to open 2 more branches in China and 1 each in England and Canada within this year. In England and Canada, he'll target Korean students studying abroad locally, but in China, he also plans to open classes teaching Korean to local Chinese people.\\n\\n03 'Choam' Established by Culture and Alternative Education Movement Activists\\nConceived essay-writing hagwon as a method of reality participation... Strong characteristics of cultural community\\n\\nAmong second-generation instructors, the first to jump into the essay-writing market was Lee Yun-ho, CEO of Choam C&C. Class of '81, he was a student movement activist and cultural movement activist who had such a passionate university period that he transferred between 3 universities. CEO Lee's entry into the hagwon market was also to raise money to create the culture criticism magazine <Review>.\\n\\nCEO Lee established Serim Supplementary Hagwon, the precursor to Choam Essay-Writing Hagwon, in Siheung in 1994 with colleague Song Jae-hee, with whom he had worked together in organizations like the Seoul Workers' Union. It was a neighborhood supplementary hagwon located in a corner of a traditional market where there were only 3 schools in the area.\\n\\n\\\"Siheung is the most peripheral neighborhood even within Seoul. It's culturally barren. We opened a hagwon in a traditional market alley, and in the first year, we had exactly 3 students total in elementary and middle school divisions. The next year, 1995, 87 students who were high school sophomores at the time registered, and we finally took shape as a hagwon.\\\"\\n\\nThis is CEO Lee's account. After establishing himself to some extent in Siheung, he moved the hagwon to Bangbae-dong in 1999. At this time, he changed the sign to Choam Essay-Writing Hagwon and began walking the path of a specialized essay-writing hagwon in earnest. However, CEO Lee says, \\\"The hagwon we wanted to create wasn't exactly a writing hagwon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The idea was to do proper youth education for once. We thought of the hagwon as a kind of method of reality participation while creating a culture criticism magazine. We wanted to teach young people how to properly enjoy culture.\\n\\nInstructor Song Jae-hee, an early member, is also someone who created 'Haja,' a youth job experience center, together with Professor Cho Han-hye-jung of Yonsei University. So around 1997-98, when we were moving from Siheung to Bangbae-dong, we had much internal debate about whether to open a hagwon or establish an alternative school.\\n\\nThe conclusion was that a hagwon would be better for targeting ordinary students living within institutional education, rather than an alternative school that could become just our own liberation zone. What we wanted to do was provide proper education to students who were alienated from their labor, namely studying.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee's continuing explanation. During the Bangbae-dong period, Choam was more like a kind of community than a hagwon.\\n\\nWarm Bangbae-dong community period as foundation\\n\\n\\\"Even after students entered university, they created a group called 'Areumaari' among themselves and came to the hagwon to hang out on weekends. They also provided free tutoring to junior hagwon students. Students came to the hagwon and stayed even on days without classes. During exams, they gathered to study together, and after exams ended, they would stay up all night having discussions among themselves before leaving... Parents also created a group called 'Mosim-hoe' and brought rice cakes to the hagwon during exam periods.\\\"\\n\\nCEO Lee says it was \\\"a really warm period\\\" and \\\"the image of today's Choam was created during the Bangbae-dong period.\\\" The instructors at that time were Song Jae-hee, Lee Jae-ryun, Seong Min-gi, Han Sa-young, Han Gyeong-rok, etc., who could be called Choam's early members. Music critic Kang Hyeon, Seo Yeong-chae, a Hanshin University professor active as a culture critic, Kwon Seong-wu, a Sookmyung Women's University professor, and others who had done cultural movement work with CEO Lee also participated as regular essay-writing instructors.\\n\\nHowever, Choam's Bangbae-dong period lasted less than a year. They were evicted because the hagwon building was taken over by a pyramid organization. Afterward, Choam maintained a 'hagwon without a hagwon' format for about a year, with only instructors and no hagwon building. Choam instructors created an instructor network called 'Choam Network' and opened lectures under the Choam name at other hagwons like Haklim Hagwon, Cheongsan Hagwon, and Daechi A+ Hagwon.\\n\\n\\\"Around the time we were evicted from Bangbae-dong, we had many concerns that 'the moment our educational institution becomes a hagwon, our passion drops and children begin to look like money.' We thought that not establishing a hagwon might be one way to preserve children's value.\\\"\\n\\nChoam ended its wandering life and reopened in Seoul's Mokdong in 2001. Initially, it was also a small hagwon with 4 classrooms.\\n\\n\\\"The jackpot came the next year, 2002. Somehow, 1,200 students flocked during the year-end admissions season. It exploded suddenly. Work was paralyzed. We turned most away and took about 600 into the admissions process.\\\"\\n\\nAs rumors spread that most of Choam's students went to prestigious universities, students flocked in explosively. Based on the success in Mokdong in 2002, Choam advanced to Daechi-dong's hagwon district the next year and achieved success in Daechi-dong as well, building today's reputation. Currently, Choam operates 4 directly managed hagwons in Mokdong, Daechi, Banpo, and Nowon, with 160 instructors alone. Partner hagwons that supply Choam content number 56.\\n\\n04 Labor Movement Activists' Group 'Eureka'\\nFormed teams for year-end essay-writing season lectures... Classic reading classes worked, building reputation\\n\\nThe representative instructors of Eureka Essay-Writing Academy, Jang Min-seong (Seoul National University class of '84) and Park Hong-soon (Sungkyunkwan University class of '82), are 386 student movement alumni classified as South Korean Socialist Workers' Alliance (Saromaeng) affiliates. Early member Lee Hae-woong (Hankuk University of Foreign Studies class of '85), who serves as director, also served as vice president of the student council in 1988 and was wanted for the 1992 Democratic Unification (Jamin-tong) incident, living in hiding for 3 years.\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-woong says, \\\"We jumped into hagwon circles purely because we had no way to make a living.\\\" Representative instructor Jang Min-seong first started essay-writing lectures in 1996 at Cheongsan Hagwon, a representative large hagwon in Gangdong. Initially, it was a small-scale lecture targeting students aiming for Seoul National University.\\n\\n\\\"Essay-writing lectures require corrections, so they're labor-intensive. So I gradually brought in colleagues and juniors I knew, and the team that formed this way created today's Eureka: Park Hong-soon, Lim Seung-cheol (class of '82), Park Gyu-hwan (lecture name Park Su-rim, class of '86), Chae Gi-seok (class of '89), and others.\\\"\\n\\nThey advanced to Daechi-dong in 1998. As students increasingly came all the way to Gangbuk to hear about the Jang Min-seong team's reputation, they decided to advance to Daechi-dong altogether. Even after advancing to Daechi-dong, for a while they didn't open their own hagwon directly but taught at other hagwons.\\n\\nAt that time, essay-writing classes were mostly taken briefly by students aiming for Seoul's top universities after the CSAT ended. In other words, because it was a market that only flourished briefly at year-end, keeping hagwon doors open all year didn't make financial sense.\\n\\nThus, Eureka members usually engaged in their 'main jobs' at local unions and civic organizations, then formed teams for essay-writing lectures when year-end came. They began jumping into the essay-writing market in earnest and established today's organizational framework between 1998-2000. This was because as admissions formats changed annually, essay-writing gradually emerged as an important screening element.\\n\\nWhat enabled Eureka to build a reputation in Daechi-dong was that Eureka students achieved outstanding results in the logic and essay-writing competition hosted by Seoul National University. In the early 2000s, winning the Seoul National University-hosted competition meant Seoul National University early admission acceptance. During this period, the image was created that \\\"to go to Seoul National University, you must go to Eureka.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Lee Hae-woong explains Eureka's secret to success as \\\"classic reading-centered classes worked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the beginning, Eureka conducted classes that had students read original classic texts. We usually teach centered on 30-50 classics. It's a program that's neither fun nor easy for students to follow. Many students quit within 3 months unable to endure it. However, because we teach the essence of essay-writing exams, Eureka students have strong adaptability even when essay-writing formats change.\\\"\\n\\n05 'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon' Created by Dismissed Professor\\nFormer literature critic who focused on educational publishing business then turned to essay-writing\\n\\nPark Hak-cheon, CEO of 'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon,' which has 1,600 franchise hagwons, is counted as having an unusual background in hagwon circles as a professor-turned-entrepreneur. A Seoul National University College of Education graduate, he worked as a teacher at Muhak Girls' Middle School and Seoul National University Teachers College Middle School while also debuting as a literature critic. He's the owner of unique credentials, having published over 30 critiques in <Literary Thought>, <Practice Literature>, <Hangilmun Literature>, <Literature and Society>, <Literature and Criticism>, and other publications.\\n\\nAfter earning Korea's first doctoral degree in Korean Language Education from Seoul National University in 1990, he was appointed as a full-time professor in Jeonju University's Korean Language Education Department but was dismissed in 1992 for trying to organize a faculty council. He moved to Hansaem Publishing and transformed into an educational publisher, serving as editorial director of <Reading and Logic>. During this period, he developed the <Hansaem CSAT Gold Series> and recorded 5 billion won [approximately $3.75 million USD] in profits.\\n\\nCEO Park, who succeeded as an educational publisher, jumped into the hagwon market in 1998. The opening of 'Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Research Institute,' established with joint investment from about 60 colleague professors, teachers, and writers to write books, became the catalyst.\\n\\nPark Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Classroom is the opposite of how Choam and Eureka recently try to advance from hagwons into the educational publishing industry—it jumped into hagwon business starting from the educational publishing industry. Representative instructor Yoon Seong-jin of this hagwon says, \\\"Even when we opened the office in Yeoksam-dong, we never imagined we would jump into the hagwon market.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At first, it was literally a research institute for writing. There wasn't even a classroom in the office. But many people came thinking it was an essay-writing hagwon after seeing the 'Essay-Writing Research Institute' sign. We also thought that teaching students directly would probably help with writing, so we rented 2 classrooms in Gangnam and Seocho-dong and started classes for children who came looking for us specifically.\\\"\\n\\nHe says, \\\"Until now, we focused more on the educational publishing industry than hagwons\\\" and \\\"We operated hagwons at a level where researchers could proceed without interference with research until last year. Even now, we only have 4 directly managed hagwons. In the hagwon market, we're actually later entrants than Choam or Eureka.\\\"\\n\\n06 Why 386 Student Movement Alumni?\\nDifferent from expensive tutoring... Engaged in public education, not hagwon education\\n\\nWhat enabled 386 student movement alumni to dominate Gangnam's essay-writing market, a world of 'war of all against all,' a jungle more brutal than nature where the logic of survival of the fittest rules?\\n\\nInstructor Choi Gyu-yun from Apgujeong Cho Dong-ki Essay-Writing Hagwon says, \\\"The 386 generation established their identity through discussion and debate\\\" and \\\"People who encountered grand discourse through staying up all night discussing and agonizing during university naturally show strengths in essay-writing, especially integrated essay-writing, compared to other subjects.\\\" He also adds, \\\"Among instructors from the '90s class, those who studied social sciences a lot during university are naturally strong in essay-writing.\\\"\\n\\nEureka Essay-Writing Academy Director Lee Hae-woong also says, \\\"Essay-writing classes are similar to seminar format where one senior forms a team with juniors to read social science books and discuss.\\\" \\\"Student movement instructors who jumped into the essay-writing market mostly do it because they enjoy reading books and discussing with children themselves.\\n\\nThey didn't approach essay-writing as a business model but enjoyed essay-writing classes themselves.\\\" He adds, \\\"I think we succeeded precisely because we didn't approach it as a business model.\\\"\\n\\nDirector Cho Dong-ki also says, \\\"One virtue of student movement people is trust in people. I've never once viewed children as money. That part seems to have matched up.\\\"\\n\\nChoam CEO Lee Yun-ho analyzes, \\\"Continuous self-development desire and instructors' community consciousness seem to have been the foundation of success.\\\" One example is the all-night seminar held every Sunday from 12 PM to 6 AM.\\n\\nChoam has maintained the tradition of Sunday all-night seminars for the past 13 years since the Siheung period. All instructors participate without exception, intensely debating 'what to teach children.' Based on content discussed here, Choam develops class models and makes important hagwon decisions.\\n\\nCEO Lee says, \\\"When hiring instructors, we ask whether they can do all-night seminars or not. If they can't, we don't hire them.\\\" This shows how much all-night seminars occupy an important part of Choam's culture. After seminars end, after-parties follow.\\n\\nAs such, they don't agree with criticism that \\\"people who were going to transform society are running hagwon businesses and making big money.\\\" CEO Lee Yun-ho says, \\\"The problem is thinking of hagwon education and public education as separate.\\\" He also points out, \\\"Education has public character regardless of what kind of education it is. The difference is whether it's institutional or not. What's actually doing fragmentary exam-oriented education isn't hagwons but schools.\\\" CEO Lee's continuing argument:\\n\\n\\\"Choam jumped into the essay-writing market to find alternatives to cramming institutional education. Essay-writing fundamentally can't be cramming education. The core of essay-writing is training to read and think for oneself. In this sense, we think we're actually doing alternative education and educational movement.\\\"\\n\\nHe adds, \\\"We had many concerns about entering the hagwon education market, but we try to resolve those concerns by aiming for alternative education.\\\" The product of such concerns is the teacher academy 'House Woven with Grass' that opened last April with progressive professors including Hong Se-hwa, editorial writer for <Hankyoreh Newspaper>, Professor Cho Han-hye-jung of Yonsei University, and Lim Heon-yeong, director of the Institute for Research in Collaborating Society. CEO Lee supports 'House Woven with Grass' with 20 million won [approximately $15,000 USD] monthly, meaning to return money earned from hagwons to society.\\n\\nDirector Cho Dong-ki also points out, \\\"The core issue isn't hagwon education but hagwon education costs.\\\" He argues that supplementing deficient areas to succeed in a competitive society shouldn't be viewed negatively itself.\\n\\n\\\"The logic of people criticizing hagwon education is that wealth is inherited through expensive hagwon education. If so, they should problematize expensive private tutoring, not hagwon classes. Hagwon classes costing around 150,000 won [approximately $113 USD] per month can rather be called public education.\\\"\\n\\n07 How Much Do Famous Essay-Writing Instructors Earn?\\nOnly around 10 people earn over 100 million won annually... 4-5 year veterans earn 60-70 million won [approximately $45,000-52,500 USD]\\n\\nContrary to the commonly known 'essay-writing instructor = over 100 million won [approximately $75,000 USD] annual salary,' even among so-called successful essay-writing instructors, not many earn over 100 million won annually, according to essay-writing hagwon officials. Only around 10 instructors throughout the entire essay-writing market earn over 100 million won annually. You have to be a 'brand' instructor to earn over 100 million won annually. This is because unlike language or math subjects, essay-writing cannot accommodate large lectures.\\n\\n\\\"Usually star instructors give large lectures to at least 100, up to 300 people at once, but essay-writing, due to the subject's characteristics, requires classes of around 10 people at most. At most, you can't exceed 20 people. Industrially speaking, it's a low value-added industry. Therefore, it's a subject where star instructors or 100-million-won salaries are difficult to achieve.\\\"\\n\\nThis is Eureka Director Lee Hae-woong's explanation. He adds, \\\"Recently there are quite a few instructors from other subjects switching to essay-writing instruction, but if making money is the purpose, it's incomprehensible.\\\" Though it varies by hagwon, the common understanding in this field is that 4-5 year veteran essay-writing instructors average 60-70 million won [approximately $45,000-52,500 USD] annually.\\n\\nExceptionally, Choam Essay-Writing Academy has set a kind of wage peak system at around 45 million won [approximately $33,750 USD]. Befitting a hagwon that emphasizes community consciousness, this is because excessive salary differences between instructors could create discord.\\n\\nAnother reason essay-writing instructors' salaries are lower than other subjects is that unlike other subjects, essay-writing hagwons are a market that only briefly thrives during admissions season. CEO Lee Yun-ho says, \\\"Essay-writing market is where you have to work 8 weeks to earn a year's worth. This applies to famous hagwons and famous instructors alike.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough essay-writing has recently become important, almost no high school seniors attend essay-writing hagwons during the school term. Most 'go all-in' for 8 weeks around early admissions or after the CSAT ends. This is why 'no-questions-asked expensive private tutoring' particularly thrives in the essay-writing market.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, hagwons have turned their attention to the elementary and middle school market, which has relatively more time flexibility, to create a 'stable virtuous cycle structure.' Particularly from hagwons' perspective, elementary students are more attractive because they can conduct classes year-round without 'vacations' (during midterm and final exam periods each semester, all hagwons except those for school records rest for almost a month each. Hagwon instructors call this period 'vacation'). Hagwon officials analyze that overall, the elementary and middle school market is much larger than the high school admissions market.\\n\\nThe hagwon that first jumped into the elementary school market was Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Classroom. Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Research Institute jumped into the elementary essay-writing market in 2002, supplying self-developed elementary student textbooks and educational programs to franchise hagwons.\\n\\nThe elementary division business that started with 10 franchises in the first year benefited from last year's essay-writing boom, with over 1,000 franchises added in the past year alone, and currently 1,600 franchises nationwide are thriving. Cho Dong-ki Korean Essay-Writing Specialized Hagwon shows strength in middle school divisions. Choam also plans to advance into the elementary market soon.\\n\\nIndustry officials unanimously say the essay-writing market is still in its infancy stages. The possibility of growing much more is high. Park Hak-cheon Essay-Writing Hagwon instructor Yoon Seong-jin says, \\\"Within the next 3-5 years, as subjective question ratios increase in each subject, eventually all subjects will change to essay-writing style\\\" and \\\"Today's major educational trend is flowing toward strengthening essay-writing education.\\\"\\n\\nEureka Director Lee Hae-woong also says, \\\"When the CSAT was first implemented, everyone was bewildered.

It's because they remember last year's Chuseok, which they thought would be their 'last ancestral rites in Korea.'\\n\\nThe hair salon the couple had run together for 19 years stopped being profitable from 2000 onward due to low-cost hair salon chains that opened nearby.

It was the smallest shop they had ever worked in. They didn't hire any employees either. Their strategy also went in the opposite direction from before. Though the shop was small, they avoided price wars. Instead, they displayed premium perm solutions and hair protection products next to mirrors, explaining to customers what made expensive products good and why they cost more. For differentiation, they also began offering computer-assisted hair loss management services. Mrs. Choi, who had experience working at a skincare clinic, learned hair loss management techniques. Regular customers increased thanks to services rarely seen in neighborhood hair salons. Choi said, \\\"It's still difficult, but we've reached the point where we don't worry about our two sons' hagwon tuition.\\\"\\n\\nStudious People Succeed\\n# 2 Lee Jun-ho (46), who runs a pufferfish restaurant in Gojan-dong, Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, is a 'studious self-employed person.' Having worked as a researcher at a large corporation for 12 years, he always approaches business with research. When Lee lost his job during the foreign exchange crisis, he used all his savings of 40 million won [approximately $30,000 USD] to open a small sashimi restaurant in Ansan. From that time, he began studying self-employment. Though he learned how to slice fish from a relative in the food business, he keenly felt that his clumsy 'knife skills' had limitations. While running the sashimi restaurant in the evenings, he worked as a kitchen assistant at a famous Japanese restaurant in Seoul during the day to learn cooking.\\n\\nWhen he opened a Japanese restaurant in front of the Sihwa Industrial Complex in Siheung, Gyeonggi Province in 2001, he could confidently serve as head chef as well. The initially smooth-running Japanese restaurant fell into difficulty when companies in the industrial complex closed one after another due to the economic downturn. As quiet days without customers continued, he again studied pufferfish cooking on his own. The pufferfish cooking license he had obtained thinking 'it might be useful someday' became a valuable weapon.\\n\\nLast summer, he gave up the shop in front of the industrial complex and moved downtown to open a pufferfish restaurant. The result was a great success. Lowering the price of pufferfish dishes, which are expensive and not easily accessible, was particularly effective. Like the restaurant's name 'Eight Thousand Pufferfish Restaurant,' he attracted family customers by lowering the price to 8,000 won [approximately $6 USD] per serving. Since pufferfish is a menu item that can't easily be eaten at home, it's an item with steady dining-out demand. His research led to menu diversification. He added high-end menu items using premium ingredients like fresh wild pufferfish, and developed pufferfish and pork belly bulgogi by stir-frying pufferfish with pork belly.\\n\\nHe said, \\\"Whether the restaurant does well or poorly, you can only survive by studying and making changes.\\\"\\n\\nTrial and Error as Precious Experience\\n# 3 When Kang Myeong-gu (45) started his own business 10 years ago after the small company he worked for collapsed, his dreams were big. He wanted to develop popular dining items and run a franchise business.\\n\\nHowever, attempts and failures repeated in succession. He opened a pasta specialty restaurant, Thai restaurant, chicken galbi restaurant, and fried chicken restaurant in turn, but each met with failure after just over a year. Due to lack of experience (poor location selection) and bad luck including the avian flu outbreak, things went wrong. Kang meticulously recorded the causes of his failures. After 10 years of nothing but trial and error, his wife went out to work as a learning materials instructor to support the family's livelihood. The whole family even pleaded with him, \\\"Please stop the restaurant business and look for a job.\\\"\\n\\nIn May last year, Kang spent all his remaining startup capital of 30 million won [approximately $23,000 USD] and after two months of preparation opened a beer hall ('BBQ Pork Ribs and Cold Beer') selling Western-style grilled pork ribs in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province. It was his fifth restaurant. He opened it with the feeling that 'this is really the last time.' Perhaps his previous failure experiences gave him strength. Through connections built during his business ventures, he was able to secure pork rib ingredients under favorable conditions. Developing sauces by visiting popular family restaurants was also something that wouldn't have been possible without experience.\\n\\nNow he's sailing smoothly with daily sales of about 700,000 won [approximately $530 USD]. \\\"It's still insufficient, but I'm just grateful to have succeeded this much,\\\" says Kang. However, Kang says his success wasn't like 'a cow walking backward and catching a mouse.' He believes it was possible because of the know-how and connections he built by focusing on the restaurant business. He smiled and said, \\\"If you make good use of trial and error experiences, they ultimately become the foundation for success.\\\"\\n\\n◆ Special Coverage Team: Economics Section = Jeong Seon-gu, Lee Hyun-sang, Sim Jae-wu, Kim Pil-gyu, Lim Mi-jin reporters, Photography Section = Shin In-seop reporter\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 4349, "output_tokens": 1745, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Not only university graduation but also employment and promotion depend on TOEIC scores. Is there no royal road to overcoming TOEIC stress? We heard the secrets from 7 masters who achieved perfect TOEIC scores in various fields.\\n\\nTOEIC Republic of Korea. In today's Korea, TOEIC is a rite of passage that must be taken for university graduation or employment. University graduation, employment, and promotion all depend on TOEIC scores.\\n\\nWhile there has been recent reflection that TOEIC scores don't correlate with actual English proficiency, and some companies increasingly use TOEIC scores only as criteria for document screening, the benchmark scores continue to rise as severe unemployment persists. For public corporations commonly called \\\"God-given\\\" workplaces, it's difficult to pass even document screening without scores exceeding 950 points. Stories of people failing various job entrance exams even after achieving perfect 990 scores are not uncommon.\\n\\nBecause everyone takes the test and there are always one or two people around who scored 900 or above, TOEIC is commonly thought to be a test where high scores can be quickly achieved just by learning techniques. However, anyone who has taken the TOEIC knows that it's unexpectedly not an easy test at all. Hagwon instructors unanimously say, \\\"Up to 700-800 points is possible with so-called 'secret methods.' But 900 points or above is impossible with just techniques. You need basic proficiency.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, a perfect score is another story. According to the TOEIC Committee, a total of 1,782,414 people took regular TOEIC tests domestically last year. Of these, only 1,980 people achieved the perfect score of 990 points. Only 0.1% of all test-takers received perfect scores.\\n\\n\\\"New TOEIC requires competing with fundamentals rather than techniques\\\"\\n\\nSince the TOEIC Committee introduced \\\"New TOEIC\\\" in May last year, partially revising the question format and increasing the difficulty of listening and reading sections in response to criticism that high scores were easily achievable just by mastering \\\"techniques,\\\" achieving high TOEIC scores or perfect scores has become more difficult. The scoring method was also partially revised to reduce scores in the 900s and expand the 600-800 range.\\n\\nTOEIC instructors, bank branch managers, firefighters, students... These are the 7 perfect TOEIC scorers representing the 0.1% who passed through the eye of a needle that this reporter met. Each reached the level of English master and TOEIC master in different situations using different methods. What secrets lie in these 7 people's \\\"TOEIC perfect score conquest stories\\\"?\\n\\nThe universally recognized top master in the TOEIC world is Kim Dae-gyun (43), a YBM Language Hagwon instructor. As the hagwon instructor with the most perfect TOEIC scores, he has taken the TOEIC test every month since January 1997, with over 100 attempts. He has achieved perfect scores dozens of times. While he doesn't get perfect scores every month because he takes the test to understand trends and analyze problems, he consistently achieves perfect scores.\\n\\nIn 2001, when it became problematic that he was teaching using memorized questions from tests he took monthly, he was banned from taking TOEIC in Korea for two years. During this period, he went to Japan monthly to take TOEIC, adding the title \\\"Japan TOEIC perfect score instructor.\\\" This led to partnering with Japan's famous publisher Kodansha to publish TOEIC materials in Japan, which became bestsellers.\\n\\n\\\"Reading is most important, read lots of expressions written in English\\\"\\n\\nWhat is the secret to TOEIC perfection according to the top TOEIC instructor recognized in both Korea and Japan? Unfortunately, he says, \\\"Since New TOEIC began, building skills the orthodox way rather than using tricks has become important,\\\" and \\\"It's no longer the era of secret methods.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Old TOEIC had high frequency of repeat questions, so you could get high scores by analyzing them well. It was a kind of information war. But New TOEIC hardly repeats questions. The patterns are the same, but new problems appear each time.\\\"\\n\\nHe explains, \\\"In New TOEIC, it's not easy to get scores with the old method of just memorizing repeat questions,\\\" and \\\"How well you've built fundamentals in daily life is the key to conquering New TOEIC.\\\" Unlike before, you can't just solve TOEIC problems; you need to pay attention to general English study including vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension to get good scores.\\n\\nHowever, he added that since New TOEIC still has basic patterns, grasping basic patterns by part is most important. You must memorize vocabulary abundantly, and for listening, he advised repeating practice tests until you can memorize one full set. He also advises taking the test as often as possible since becoming familiar with the test itself is important.\\n\\n\\\"If your goal is to get high TOEIC scores, you don't need to go abroad for language study. Since there are many excellent materials domestically, you can raise your English scores plenty in Korea with just determination. That's exactly what I did.\\\"\\n\\nHaving grown up well-off until elementary school, his family's fortunes declined rapidly when his father was swindled during middle school. Unable to afford English self-study books, he had to study with an English-English dictionary lying around the house. At first, his skills were inadequate so he was slow and didn't get good grades, but after about a year of studying with the English-English dictionary, both his skills and grades improved dramatically.\\n\\nEntering Korea University's English Department, he initially considered hanging around the student council office but soon decided to focus on studying and joined a club reading American current affairs magazine Time, intensively building reading comprehension skills. During the day, he visited the campus audio library where he could listen to English tapes, listening to English tapes all day long. Even when sleepy, he would lie down and sleep while listening to English tapes.\\n\\nHe says, \\\"During university, I couldn't afford to go abroad for language study like others, but I took my own inexpensive language study trip.\\\" That was the British Council. Instead of expensive conversation classes, he bought an annual membership to the materials room for just 5,000 won [approximately $4 USD] and visited the British Council whenever he had time to watch British films, to increase indirect experience of English-speaking cultures.\\n\\nRegarding criticism that many high TOEIC scorers can't say a word to foreigners, he says:\\n\\n\\\"Since TOEIC tests listening and reading abilities, conversation and writing skills don't automatically improve just from TOEIC. However, people who score high on TOEIC have English fundamentals, so they learn conversation at least faster than those who don't. I don't think (TOEIC) needs to be criticized that harshly...\\\"\\n\\nHe also emphasized, \\\"While emphasizing conversation these days is a desirable phenomenon, there are limits to skill improvement by practicing only conversation without basics,\\\" and \\\"You can use more advanced English by training to read, listen, and think a lot in English before speaking.\\\"\\n\\nJeong Sang-ho (33), director of Jeongsang Language Hagwon in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do. Taking TOEIC monthly since August 2004, he has taken it 30 times and achieved perfect scores 20 times. Regarding the secret to TOEIC perfection, he says, \\\"If you basically have grammar and reading comprehension skills, the next step is practicing to solve problems accurately.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you guess C by feeling on a problem where C is the answer and move on, your skills won't improve. You can only say you've solved that problem correctly when you know why A, B, and D aren't the answers.\\\"\\n\\nHe says solving this way virtually eliminates careless mistakes on problems you know. Of course, in actual tests where you must solve one problem every 25 seconds, it's not easy to solve while considering not only correct answers but also why wrong answers are incorrect. This means you need that much training in advance.\\n\\nSo what kind of training should you build up regularly? He says, \\\"For people scoring under 850, building grammar fundamentals is important, but for those scoring 850 or above who want higher scores, learning abundant vocabulary and expressions is necessary.\\\" When memorizing words, you must memorize not just meanings but also usage examples of how they're used in sentences.\\n\\n\\\"With grammar fundamentals and vocabulary skills built up, you can get up to 900 points. But getting from 950+ to perfect scores is another story. From experience, to get such scores, 1-2 years of English study isn't enough. Only those who've built skills through consistent English reading can achieve it.\\\"\\n\\nHaving dreamed of becoming an English teacher since childhood, he entered an English department and studied English intensively in the library for four years.\\n\\n\\\"Studying only English all day gets boring, right? So when going to the library in the morning, I'd bring one book each for reading comprehension, listening, grammar, and vocabulary, making my own schedule like 1st period grammar, 2nd period reading comprehension, rotating hourly. I also joined clubs reading Newsweek and Time for reading practice.\\\"\\n\\nHe believes true English proficiency comes from consistent reading. Just as you need abundant vocabulary to speak Korean well, and abundant vocabulary comes from abundant reading, English being a language should be the same.\\n\\nRegarding criticism that TOEIC scores don't correlate with English proficiency, he says, \\\"Reading TOEIC sentences aloud is conversation practice, and converting Korean translations to English is writing practice,\\\" and \\\"It's not a problem with TOEIC itself, but how you study TOEIC or how you utilize TOEIC scores.\\\" The problem lies with people trying to get scores through techniques rather than skills and our society's blind faith in TOEIC scores.\\n\\nShin Jeong-won (34), an instructor at Lee Ik-hoon Hagwon who transformed from simultaneous interpreter to TOEIC instructor. While developing business English courses for working adults, she took TOEIC and fell in love with \\\"TOEIC's beautiful sentences,\\\" jumping into TOEIC instruction.\\n\\nThe reason Shin praises TOEIC is that it concentrates expressions most widely used in daily business situations.\\n\\n\\\"ETS (Educational Testing Service) [the American organization that creates TOEIC] never includes expressions that could be controversial. They only make problems from expressions most widely used in daily life. This also means you can get high scores by intensively studying limited words and sentences.\\\"\\n\\nShin also didn't get a perfect score when first taking TOEIC. She consistently missed one or two questions. Only after taking TOEIC over 10 times could she achieve perfect scores.\\n\\n\\\"At first, I trusted only my English skills and solved by feeling whether expressions were natural or not. But after taking the test several times, I saw consistent problem patterns. When I solved problems thinking about what they were trying to test, I could see the answers. There are certain rules.\\\"\\n\\nShin, who achieves nearly perfect TOEIC scores after realizing those rules, says, \\\"To get high scores in limited time, you must choose materials or instructors who can extract that for you.\\\" For example, with vocabulary, while it seems you must memorize and study everything, there's no need to memorize words that might appear only once or twice.\\n\\n\\\"For grammar, one proper textbook from beginning to end is sufficient. The problem is that knowing grammar and being able to answer correctly when that grammar appears in problems are different. Problems where you go 'Ah!' when seeing the answer - you can't get those right when they actually appear on tests.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Memorize entire sentences\\\"\\n\\nTo compensate for such blind spots, she says problem-solving should be used as a means to identify your weak points, never making problem-solving itself the purpose of study.\\n\\n\\\"If you just check answers to wrong problems and move on, your skills won't improve. You must look up grammar books to clearly identify what you misunderstood before moving on. The best method is memorizing wrong sentences entirely. If you completely memorize sentences and make them your own, you can reduce making the same mistakes when similar sentences appear.\\\"\\n\\nShe advises practicing converting Korean sentences to English sentences as the most reliable way to make English expressions your own.\\n\\n\\\"While people commonly say the best way to build English skills is abundant reading, I tell people to do lots of English composition. Reading is passively accepting English. Even expressions you recognize visually, you often can't say aloud. In contrast, expressions you've written once definitely become yours. English composition is the way to actively make English expressions your own.\\\"\\n\\nShin, a pure domestic simultaneous interpreter who never went abroad until university graduation, says she started English study this way.\\n\\n\\\"In my senior year, I decided to go to graduate school for simultaneous interpretation and registered at a hagwon. When I entered the first class, they handed out Time magazine copies and had each person interpret, with others doing sight translation on the spot. I thought it was assigned as homework the day before. But the next day was the same. While I could barely read even looking up dictionaries, I thought this wasn't the place for me and stopped going the next day.\\\"\\n\\nInstead, she went to the library and decided to memorize entirely a vocabulary book that was most revered as \\\"authoritative\\\" among university students then.\\n\\n\\\"Since simultaneous interpretation was my goal, I thought I should learn proper English expressions. I practiced self-translating by looking only at Korean in vocabulary book examples and comparing with originals. When my sentences differed from originals, I memorized the entire original sentences.\\\"\\n\\nAfter repeating this process three times over three months, she felt her English skills had definitely improved one level. She returned to the hagwon then. This time, Time was readable for her too.\\n\\n\\\"Words you can speak, you can also hear\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Since it's learning a foreign language, repetition is important. I still make mistake notebooks and carry them around, reviewing whenever I have time. When making mistake notebooks, I write wrong problems translated into Korean on the right, and write those sentences in English on the left. When reviewing, rather than looking at English sentences, I look at Korean sentences and convert them to English in my head. By repeating this process and completely making those sentences mine, I don't repeat the same mistakes.\\\"\\n\\nLee Gi-heon (29), a student on leave from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Graduate School of Interpretation. Since achieving a perfect score on his first TOEIC in 2003, he has taken about 30 tests every 2-3 months. Of these, he achieved perfect scores 16 times.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean he was an English prodigy. He first learned ABC when entering middle school, and after entering university English department, going to Canada for one year of language study was all his experience.\\n\\nThe reason he continues taking TOEIC after achieving perfect scores is because he dreams of becoming a TOEIC instructor like Kim Dae-gyun someday. He says, \\\"When I was intensively studying TOEIC, I was curious about what famous instructors' classes contained, so I went around listening to them.\\\" As such, he has his own insights about TOEIC.\\n\\nHe says, \\\"The most important things in English are words and vocabulary.\\\" But he says you shouldn't memorize indiscriminately. \\\"I challenged it right after entering university but gave up. When I opened it again after getting TOEIC perfect scores, I still didn't know most of the words. If TOEIC perfect score is your goal, you only need to memorize frequently used words. You should memorize commonly used words first, then increase difficulty.\\\"\\n\\nHe also says, \\\"Of course you must listen a lot,\\\" but adds the condition \\\"you can't just listen.\\\" He says to listen while reading aloud. There's a reason for this too.\\n\\n\\\"Not all words you can hear are words you can speak, but you can hear over 90% of words you can pronounce accurately at proper speed. So when practicing listening, you must practice reading sentences aloud while listening.\\\"\\n\\nHe says, \\\"This practice eventually becomes conversation practice too, so it's killing two birds with one stone.\\\"\\n\\nHe also says, \\\"You can conquer TOEIC knowing only middle school level grammar.\\\" This means there's no need to study overly difficult books. For those wanting to study grammar separately, he recommends reading grammar books in English if possible. The book he recommends is from Cambridge University Press. He explains that even this, only beginner and intermediate levels are sufficient.\\n\\nRegarding reading comprehension that Koreans are most confident about, he also delivers sharp advice. What we think we've been doing since middle school - reading comprehension and English reading are different. According to him, reading comprehension is studying while looking up dictionaries and analyzing sentences one by one. English reading, however, is reading English texts like reading newspapers normally.\\n\\nTo improve reading comprehension skills, he recommends doing lots of English reading rather than comprehension exercises. What's important here is reading texts matching your skill level. Rather than reading overly difficult texts indiscriminately, it's better to read many texts you can speed-read. He says, \\\"A level where no more than 3 unknown words appear per page is appropriate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People who say they studied hard but didn't get scores often just solve lots of problems indiscriminately. Rather than roughly solving 1,000 problems, it's more effective to solve even just a few hundred problems with thorough analysis.\\\"\\n\\nHe also says, \\\"For TOEIC, it's important to keep taking it even when unprepared.\\\" The point is that by analyzing how to allocate time in test venues and identifying your weak points while taking tests, you can eventually achieve target scores.\\n\\n\\\"I keep taking it because TOEIC instructor is my dream, but I think TOEIC isn't a test requiring over a year of study. Set a goal to finish in a short period and finish quickly. Then from that point, study your favorite fields in English.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frequent use of mass media is also desirable\\\"\\n\\nLee Sang-jin (35), TOEIC instructor at Lee Ik-hoon Hagwon, was a working adult at a trading company until just 2 years ago. His TOEIC score at university graduation was 825 points. This was after raising it 150 points from his initial score of 675. The difference from ordinary workers was that he continued taking TOEIC monthly after getting hired. He says, \\\"I took TOEIC tests like a hobby.\\\"\\n\\nFor him, monthly TOEIC tests were an escape from repetitive daily life.\\n\\n\\\"I enjoyed the fierce tension you can only feel in test venues. Also, seeing my TOEIC scores gradually rise each month gave me the feeling I was improving.\\\"\\n\\nHis score of 825 at hiring also rose steadily to 860, 890, and 930. Finally, in April 2003, he achieved the perfect score of 990 he had dreamed of.\\n\\nUnable to attend hagwons due to work, he joined a TOEIC cafe on a portal site. Initially for information, but answering questions posted on bulletin boards once or twice led to connections that extended to offline study groups.\\n\\n\\\"At first, I started TOEIC tutoring for fun and my own study. Students said I taught so well and suggested I make it my full-time profession. I also found teaching English enjoyable.\\\"\\n\\nAfter quitting the trading company in April 2005, he started TOEIC instruction at Lee Ik-hoon Hagwon from the following month.\\n\\nRegarding the secret to raising his 825-point TOEIC to perfect scores while working at a company, instructor Lee Sang-jin points to \\\"utilizing mass media extensively.\\\" He overcame the disadvantage of being unable to attend hagwons by actively utilizing mass media.\\n\\n\\\"I listened daily to intermediate English conversation broadcast from 7:45-8:15 AM every morning, and perfectly memorized expressions that appeared each day. I also consistently listened to EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] radio TOEIC lectures for about a year to train listening. For reading comprehension, I extensively used materials posted on internet TOEIC cafes.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, he says he's a case where TOEIC scores rose relatively slowly because he studied things not appearing on tests, and for those targeting high scores short-term, it's important to study only what appears on tests, whether attending hagwons or through internet cafes.\\n\\n\\\"While New TOEIC doesn't repeat questions like before, vocabulary and patterns remain the same. Like all tests, what appears on tests is obvious. Therefore, grasping patterns is important. If you only study things that won't appear on tests forever, you'll have to study that much longer.\\\"\\n\\nFirefighter Jo Hyeon (35), Jeollanam-do Provincial Government Comprehensive Situation Room fire lieutenant, who became a topic after achieving perfect scores on TOEIC administered March 26 last year. In September 2003, wanting to measure his English skills, he scored 680 points - far from perfect. However, after grinding his teeth in determination, he achieved the perfect 990 points in 2.5 years. This was accomplished while working difficult every-other-day shifts.\\n\\nHe says, \\\"Having a clear goal helped.\\\" His goal was attending EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) training in America. The National Emergency Management Agency selects one person annually from each city/province for 4-6 month EMT training. The selection criterion is TOEIC scores. You can apply for this program with 500+ points. But with many applicants, higher scores are advantageous.\\n\\n\\\"At first, I simply targeted high scores too. But in the second month I got 770, third month 840. Getting familiar with test patterns probably raised my scores. As scores rose, I became greedy.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, scores that rose to 840 in three months stagnated for the next year. Concluding his grammar was weak, he solved 7-8 TOEIC grammar problem books.\\n\\n\\\"Study seems to improve in steps. It's important to endure when scores don't come and invest consistently. Coldly analyzing your weak points is also important.\\\"\\n\\nAfter rising from 840 to 870 points in a year, he achieved perfect 990 points the very next month after scoring 870. That summer, he was selected for EMT and visited America as he had dreamed.\\n\\nJang Jun-su (55), former Shinhan Bank Yeouido Nam branch manager, challenged TOEIC at age 54 last August and achieved perfect scores. Known as a branch manager good at English, he often consulted customers about English study methods. One day, thinking \\\"Maybe I should try again after a long time,\\\" he applied.\\n\\nHis score that month was 915 points. While others would be satisfied with such scores, his pride was hurt. Understandably so, since his score 5 years earlier was 955 points. Four months later, he achieved perfect scores.\\n\\nOf course, his achieving TOEIC perfect scores that even young people find difficult, with just 4 months of study at an age 6 months from retirement, was supported by lifelong English learning. Born in 1952, Year of the Horse, he never set foot on foreign soil until university graduation. His English grades were average during school. He became an English master after starting his first job as elementary school teacher after university graduation.\\n\\n\\\"Lifestyle integration of English environment is important!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When I came home from work at 5 PM then, evenings were so boring. Then I saw a newspaper ad saying they'd send AFKN [Armed Forces Korea Network] news scripts and tapes to homes twice monthly and applied.\\\"\\n\\nAt first, less than two-thirds was audible. But after listening consistently for several weeks, words became audible, then word clusters, and finally sentences began to be heard. Excited, he listened to English tapes while washing dishes and cleaning rooms. He brought English into his daily life. He has maintained this lifestyle habit for 30 years.\\n\\nEven now, his alarm is the 5 AM AFKN morning news. He sleeps with a radio-clock set for 5 AM. During his 40-minute commute from Seoul's Dobong-dong to Yeouido, he listens to pre-recorded Discovery Channel documentaries or The Oprah Winfrey Show. At work, he starts his day reading Asian Wall Street Journal and Korea Herald newspapers. For books he wants to read, he gets English originals.\\n\\n\\\"If I had studied English by going to hagwons, sitting and memorizing vocabulary from the beginning, I would have quit from boredom long ago. I never studied English that way in my life. Instead, I brought English into my daily life. What if it's Konglish? Keep doing it and it becomes English.\\\"\\n\\n▶ Part 1 Don't just look at people, observe objects and surroundings too! In Part 1, difficult problems in photos with people as subjects often have answers in descriptions of surroundings rather than people. For example, a photo showing people walking with a woodpile visible behind them would have 'There is a pile of wood' as the answer. Even in photos of people observing something through microscopes in laboratories, rather than the prominently visible faces and microscopes, 'She is wearing gloves' might be the answer.\\n\\n▶ Part 2 Must learn standardized answer expressions Part 2 has expressions that consistently appear as answers. 'I'm not sure' appears as answers more often than 'I don't know.' Other expressions appearing as answers include 'Not that I know of,' 'Not that I'm aware of,' 'I'm not sure,' 'That hasn't been decided yet,' 'Let me check it for you,' 'It's up to you,' 'Either will be fine,' 'Whichever is faster,' 'Neither,' etc.\\n\\n▶ Part 3 Carefully catch answer clues In Part 3, read questions first, and for 'What are they discussing?' type questions, answers usually appear in the first exchange, while answers to future tense questions like 'What will the man do?' mostly appear at the end of conversations. Also in Parts 3 and 4, when words like but, however, actually, now, plus, except, please, well appear in conversations, answer clues often follow.\\n\\n▶ Reading Comprehension Must consistently ask 'why' Reading comprehension requires solving plenty of good problems and consistently asking 'why.' Using English-English dictionaries is essential, and reading lots of easy texts to optimize English sense is important. Also, reading comprehension is a time battle. You must practice sufficiently with good problems to read sentences quickly and accurately and solve without burden. Fortunately, Parts 5, 6, and 7 have more connectivity than old TOEIC, making comprehensive learning easier. Reading comprehension's importance will grow further.\\n\\n▶ Part 5 Part 5 has about 35-40% word form problems finding parts of speech for blanks. Word form problems should be solved quickly by understanding sentence structure without relying on interpretation. Time must be saved here to properly tackle Part 7. About 25% are grammar problems where identifying what grammatical element the problem asks about is key. This requires solving many problems. About 35-40% are vocabulary problems where high scores are impossible by memorizing only dictionary meanings of individual vocabulary when memorizing words. Often, words with identical Korean meanings have only one word suitable for given sentences. English has verbs and objects, adjectives and nouns, verbs and adverbs, verbs and prepositions that always pair together. Vocabulary must be studied as paired chunks.\\n\\n▶ Part 6 In New TOEIC, Part 6 is an intermediate stage between Parts 5 and 7, with greatly strengthened reading elements. About 5 out of 12 total problems are 'Context Questions' unsolvable by interpreting only sentences with blanks. First try finding answers from sentences with blanks, and when 2 or more answer choices are possible, go back up to read passages and understand context.\\n\\n▶ Part 7 Part 7's biggest problem is time shortage. Therefore, how quickly you solve Parts 5 and 6 to secure time for Part 7 is crucial. In Part 7, you must abandon the habit of reading questions first then reading passages while solving problems. Those with habits of reading questions first then finding related parts in passages later suffer embarrassing defeats on relatively low-difficulty General Questions and inference problems requiring understanding overall context. When reading comprehension skills are somewhat developed, reading passages first helps save more time.\\n\\n▶ Part 1 Selective dictation Investing much time and energy studying Part 1, which has 10 questions in New TOEIC, is practically time-wasting. After memorizing previously tested vocabulary and expressions, you need to select and organize only parts you don't hear. The method developed for this is selective dictation. After solving one complete set (10 questions), listen again, skip sentences you hear clearly, and listen once more only to sentences you don't hear well. Then do dictation in notebooks and check corrections against correct answers. Since Part 1 requires momentary concentration, practice listening only once without repeated listening. After practicing one complete set this way, your notebook contains selective dictation materials with only parts inaudible to you. This saves time and catches inaudible parts, killing two birds with one stone.\\n\\n▶ Part 2 Memorize past problem question-answer patterns entirely What must precede getting over half the points in Part 2 is memorizing patterns of frequently tested problems. Since consistently appearing question types often appear again with slight modifications, you must practice with materials organizing questions and correct answer parts separately, continuing to read aloud until questions flow from your mouth even without looking at materials. Summarizing question cores When memorizing basic problem and answer type patterns, you must simultaneously train to summarize question cores. Since this is a format requiring choosing correct answers from three options, consistent practice converting question cores into brief Korean summaries can be effective. This not only increases accuracy but also allows hearing three options without forgetting what was asked.\\n\\n▶ Part 3 First dialogue dictation Part 3 combines several Part 2 question-answers with dialogue in between. What test-takers find most difficult in Part 3 is having to solve three problems while listening to one conversation. To solve this efficiently, accurate listening to the first dialogue is very important. Usually, the first dialogue contains clues to the first problem's answer. Also, listening well to the first dialogue increases understanding of subsequent content. Therefore, developing the habit of dictating only first dialogues after solving all problems creates the effect of unconsciously focusing on first dialogues even in test venues. PPS (Paraphrasing Pattern Summary) To quickly select correct answers in Part 3, it's good to train in identifying how answer clues are expressed differently in options. For example, 'reduced price' in passages appearing as 'discount price' in options. After finishing first dialogue dictation, practice reading aloud, then finally find only parts where answer clues are presented differently from passages and organize separately in small notebooks. Organizing these differently expressed parts helps understand paraphrasing mechanisms and leads to quickly selecting correct answers. It also speeds up finding answers in Part 7 (reading comprehension).\\n\\n▶ Part 4 First four sentences dictation Unlike Parts 2 and 3, Part 4 passages have one person continuing to speak. Such passages mostly mention core content like topics or purposes at the beginning, add detailed content or evidence in the middle, then conclude with finishing content. Therefore, if you can't understand content until the first four sentences, you must guess three problems using only audible words. To prepare for this, after solving problems, first do dictation of the front four sentences in dictation notebooks. Since Part 4 content and flow are considerably standardized, such training develops ability to infer overall content by listening to front parts. It also has the advantage of reducing burden for understanding content while focusing on clue listening.\\n\\n▶ Tips Test day strategies Most students often intently study reading vocabulary or past expressions until just before tests, hoping to get one more problem right, but on test day mornings, it's better to head to test venues while listening to Part 3 and 4 content you already know well. This provides the advantage of entering test venues while maintaining listening rhythm plus building confidence. Also, just before tests, there's a brief Direction period when many people solve reading problems worrying about time shortage. However, if you're in a situation where you can't solve several problems during Direction, spending that time reviewing Parts 3 or 4 to find sections with long problems and options clustered together and interpreting them once in advance can provide much more help later.\\n\\nOh Hyo-rim_Monthly JoongAng Reporter [hyolim@joongang.co.kr]\\nSee more magazine articles\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 17786, "output_tokens": 7719, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Will today's young people be able to receive pensions in their old age? Statistically, it will be depleted by 2047. Only 13% of citizens benefit from the National Pension. Over 80% of people are not receiving National Pension benefits. This is an issue that the Grand National Party must commonly examine and is being discussed in the National Assembly. What should be done about the National Pension whose funds have hit bottom? Even if implemented, it only covers 13% of the elderly, so what about the remaining 80% of elderly people? A basic pension is being discussed, but ultimately the burden increases while benefits decrease. What are your thoughts on this?\\n\\nWon Hee-ryong=The National Pension is virtually the only welfare benefit. Yet young generations are anxious about whether they can pay now and receive later. There's 120 trillion won [approximately $90 billion USD] accumulated, and this will eventually accumulate to nearly 1,000 trillion won [approximately $750 billion USD], but it can't be invested due to future security concerns. At the national level, it's necessary to establish proper management plans to reassure citizens. There are many blind spots. Even when elderly reach the age, too few are beneficiaries. It's already submitted to the National Assembly and is also Grand National Party policy, but let's divide the National Pension into a basic pension that provides uniform payments regardless of income and an income-proportional pension where you receive in proportion to what you paid. Like mandatory insurance coverage, we should guarantee minimum coverage while allowing those who pay more to receive more. For those who cannot properly pay pensions, I think we have no choice but to go with a method where the state covers it with taxes in the long term.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=Hagwon education costs are an enormous burden on our poor working families' household finances. Hagwon education costs are said to range from 18 trillion won [approximately $13.5 billion USD] to 33 trillion won [approximately $25 billion USD] per year. The annual budget for public education is 30 trillion won [approximately $22.5 billion USD]. Hagwon education costs exceed the entire public education budget. About half of the 30 trillion won [approximately $22.5 billion USD] in hagwon education costs is reportedly spent on English education. If English could be studied with less money, I think the burden would be greatly reduced. How would you apply hagwon education cost caps?\\n\\nGo Jin-hwa=Looking at statistics, 21.5 trillion won [approximately $16 billion USD] was spent on hagwon education in 2005. We need to see how the hagwon education market is structured to find the answer. Hagwon fees account for 58%, workbooks 21% - combined that's 79%. In other words, while English education and other education are important, about 17 trillion won [approximately $12.7 billion USD] is spent to get into university. To fundamentally solve the education problem, we cannot avoid linking it to the college entrance exam system. Hagwon education costs are ultimately for getting children into good universities. I think hagwon education costs should be eliminated entirely. Public education should absorb them. Basic living costs for a family of four are 1.17 million won [approximately $875 USD]. This family needs to solve education within 50,000 won [approximately $38 USD]. Should we create a world where 'goose fathers' [fathers who work in Korea while families study abroad] and 'karaoke mothers' [mothers who work part-time jobs to pay for hagwon education] emerge? We can create social enterprises to organize quality education programs and use instructors to educate those people. Even parents earning 3-4 million won [approximately $2,250-3,000 USD] should spend hagwon education costs within one-twentieth of their income.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=My opinion on childcare doesn't differ much from yours. The Grand National Party's proposal that the state should bear the cost of education and childcare for 3-5 year old infants and toddlers is the same. Korea has become the country with the lowest birth rate in the world in an era of aging and low birth rates. Polarization is extreme. Breaking the inheritance of poverty is a major goal of welfare. The biggest challenge welfare must solve is that the rich continue to live as rich and the poor continue to become poor. To prevent this, we must reduce educational gaps. Money is spent from having a young child, educating them, until they graduate from university. Candidate Park said she would provide 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] annually, but actually about 3.6 million won [approximately $2,700 USD] per year is needed. Would this be sufficient?\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=Are you asking how to solve the problem that 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] in benefits for infants is insufficient? Mothers have much difficulty raising 3-5 year old children. So I thought we must help this much. These days, there's no choice but to send 3-5 year old children to kindergarten or daycare centers. Otherwise they have no friends, so if you send two children with a two-year age gap to kindergarten and daycare, a household has to spend over 400,000 won [approximately $300 USD]. In this situation, how can we tell them to have babies with peace of mind? We must prepare for the serious low birth rate and aging era. To promote women's economic activities, the state must take full responsibility for childcare costs. While doing it all at once is difficult, I think the government should gradually take responsibility for helping with infant childcare costs. This would require about 1.3 trillion won [approximately $975 million USD] more budget than now, but it can be resolved through appropriate budget management.\\n\\n◇Won Hee-ryong's Questions\\n\\nWon Hee-ryong=At the time of candidacy announcement and even three days ago, you advocated reviving university-administered exams. You said CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam) should be produced by EBS (Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media). Then wouldn't public education disappear? Reviving university-administered exams is a retro policy going backwards to the 1970s. Currently 190,000 middle and high school students have gone abroad. They're sick and tired of Korea's problem-solving repetitive learning. It would be good if this investment helped international competitiveness, but it's domestic-use for getting certificates. That's why they want to go to universities that can develop individual capabilities. If university-administered exams are revived at this point, I think it would encourage the trend of going abroad. Unlike the 1970s, the hagwon education market now has all parents ready to jump in if conditions allow. Why are you trying to revive university-administered exams in 2007 under these circumstances?\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=My opinion is not reviving university-administered exams but leaving it to university autonomy. The current entrance exam system essentially involves taking CSAT once and entering. Schools are determined by rankings and scores. CSAT scores can also vary depending on one's condition. America also takes the test six times. They apply for admissions with the best score among those. SAT reflects about 50%. The rest is selected autonomously by universities. How about if Korea also takes CSAT two or three times, reflecting 50%, and universities handle the rest through essays or evaluating social service activities? If someone did club activities, evaluate that as an achievement - leave it to university autonomy. This is separate from reviving university-administered exams. Many go abroad to study, but if we create public international high schools and admit students there, we can avoid creating 'goose fathers.'\\n\\nWon Hee-ryong=Instead of relocating the administrative capital to Gongju-Yeongi, you said let's move Seoul National University. Aren't universities in the Seoul metropolitan area hierarchically ranked? It's important to fundamentally break this and make social advancement not a single lane but 12 lanes, 24 lanes. We should abolish Seoul National University's undergraduate program, which is the root of the problem, and consolidate all national universities to create solutions through competition among university students - what would change by just moving it?\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=Are you saying we should go beyond high school equalization to university equalization too? Every country in the world has first-class universities. The seven first-class Ivy League universities lead American society. Britain has Oxford and Cambridge. Their graduates practice noblesse oblige. But in Korean society, people in high positions or such people avoid military service, evade taxes, and steal property. This isn't a phenomenon that occurs because universities aren't equalized. I cannot understand equalizing universities up to university level. President Roh Moo-hyun's plan to relocate the administrative capital was an impulsive plan. It was a mudepo [reckless, a Japanese term meaning 'acting without thinking'] pledge. I will make the Chungcheong-Daejeon region a central city for science and technology education. I'll also relocate Seoul National University. I'll attract branches of universities like Harvard to Korea. Why should we relocate the capital to provinces? I meant that Chungcheong Province should develop that way.\\n\\nWon Hee-ryong=Another social advancement problem in our society is the closed civil service examination system. Also, provincial universities only achieve an 82% freshman recruitment rate. Provincial university graduates taste double and triple frustration before even taking their first steps into society. What do you think about abolishing the civil service examination system in national civil servant selection? What are your thoughts on the policy of strengthening and implementing regional quotas for professional graduate schools (law, medicine, national policy graduate schools) in the future? What methods are there to guide career paths suitable for provincial university students?\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=Provincial universities are currently having difficulty attracting students, and even after students graduate, they suffer from employment problems. Provincial universities need to specialize and become competitive. I also think it's necessary to provide customized education that matches demand in industrial sectors immediately upon graduation. We need to look at what kind of talent is needed in close connection with local industries. If there's a semiconductor factory, create related departments and provide commissioned education - I think this can considerably resolve difficulties students face when entering society. Provincial universities still have many regulations preventing them from immediately introducing various programs they've developed, so these regulations should be greatly relaxed.\\n\\n◇Hong Jun-pyo's Questions\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=Wasn't there a misunderstanding about your previous remarks to candidate Park Geun-hye saying 'How can someone who hasn't even had children do childcare policy well?' and 'It's okay to abort disabled children?'\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=That's right. Thank you for giving me a chance to clarify. Who would make such foolish statements? There seems to have been political misunderstanding.\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=Actually, there's a wrong provision in the Mother and Child Health Act regarding abortion of disabled children. It allows disabled people to have abortions regardless of whether the child has disabilities. Isn't the law wrong? Perhaps when talking about disability-related issues in the future, promising to fix the law would prevent misunderstandings.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=I'm fundamentally opposed to abortion. I think it would be good for the Mother and Child Health Act to be revised with provisions that protect life.\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=You said last time that you could give newlywed couples one apartment each. Did you determine how many newlywed couples are born each year?\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=I understand it's about 20,000 households.\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=It's about 256,000 households. That's just counting pure marriages between unmarried men and women, excluding remarriages. You're saying you need to build that many houses per year. The houses being built in Dongtan New City this time are 105,000 units. The calculation is that you'd need to create about two such new cities every year. How would you do this?\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=When I said 20,000 households, I answered 20,000 households per month, 200,000-250,000 households annually. However, there are housing solutions for metropolitan areas and rural areas, and there are newlywed couples whose circumstances allow them to have their own homes, so newlywed couples who actually need housing supply are about 30,000-50,000 households. If proper homes aren't prepared, the declining birth rate problem won't be resolved.\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=When newlywed couples marry and want to get a house, they have to ask their parents for money. To own your own home typically takes 7-8 to 10 years. The total number of houses we're building annually is 460,000 households. That's including private sector numbers. If you give over 200,000 households to newlywed couples, what about other couples who really need housing and other low-income people? I think this wasn't made with precise plans for how many newlywed couples are born and how much to allocate, but seems like a mudepo pledge like President Roh Moo-hyun's administrative capital relocation pledge.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=It's a very attractive number that could sway the public when they hear it. But housing policy and economic policy can't be done with words alone. During my four years as Seoul mayor, I also built housing for ordinary people. Real estate prices rose over the past 10 years because the government excessively suppressed housing supply volume. When a government for ordinary people emerges, it should leave the wealthy to market principles and increase the quantity of apartments to provide to ordinary people at cost from a welfare perspective.\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=Suspicions are being raised about the Jeongsu Scholarship Foundation, which has assets worth 1 trillion won [approximately $750 million USD]. Don't you intend to completely free yourself and wash your hands of it at this opportunity?\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=We're currently having a policy debate. That's a question unrelated to this. How you answer is important, but you'll also be evaluated by what questions you ask in what situations, so I hope you'll keep that in mind. Since you've asked, I'll answer - this is not personal property. Since it's already been returned to society, I hope you'll clearly understand at this opportunity that it's national property.\\n\\n◇Go Jin-hwa's Questions\\n\\nGo Jin-hwa=Italy, which candidate Lee said we could catch up to, secures welfare budget twice ours. But our welfare budget actually decreased 3.3% this year. You said you'd secure 20 trillion won [approximately $15 billion USD] in welfare budget - specifically how would you do this?\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=Welfare budget has already exceeded defense and education. This is an unavoidable phenomenon as polarization worsens. It's true that our welfare budget ratio is small compared to Europe. However, Europe has advocated welfare states for a long time. Recently this has become a social problem, so France's President Sarkozy was elected arguing 'there must be growth for there to be distribution.' German Chancellor Merkel also drastically revised welfare policies. The problem is that there are still many blind spots in our country where maintaining minimum living standards is difficult. We can't reduce welfare budget for the time being. We must gradually increase it, but the problem is finances. The current fiscal scale cannot handle it. That's why I said I'd secure additional finances through 7% economic growth. Then we can handle increasing welfare finances. Even when I was Seoul mayor, I paid off debts and left with money remaining. By reducing wasteful elements and using budget effectively, 20 trillion won [approximately $15 billion USD] annually can be easily prepared.\\n\\nGo Jin-hwa=It's problematic when candidate Lee, who knows our country's budget structure well, speaks like this. Rigid expenses account for 52% of the general account budget. The Grand National Party tried to cut 1 trillion won [approximately $750 million USD] from welfare budget last year but faced fierce criticism from disabled people. You said you'd cut 20 trillion won [approximately $15 billion USD] - that's one-tenth of the annual budget. How can you create 20 trillion without increasing tax revenue by reducing spending? Almost no citizens trust this pledge.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=People who haven't done it can't do it. I've done so in business and during my Seoul mayor days. I didn't raise taxes. I have experience doubling welfare budget by cutting budget. The government said it would finish KTX construction from Seoul to Busan for 6 trillion won [approximately $4.5 billion USD], but it's not finished even after spending 18 trillion won [approximately $13.5 billion USD]. Saemangeum construction also exceeded 6 trillion won [approximately $4.5 billion USD] when it was supposed to be 1.8 trillion won [approximately $1.35 billion USD]. I don't do that. I was able to finish the Cheonggyecheon restoration project within the set budget because I completed it within the planned time. People who haven't done it can't talk about it. Only people who've done it know. People who've done it can see it. Anyone can establish plans and policies, but not everyone can implement them. I'll substitute this as my answer.\\n\\nGo Jin-hwa=Saying that people who've done it can do it isn't a pledge. It doesn't make sense for someone running for national administration to present vague reduction plans and move on. Candidate Lee continues to speak about market-centered high growth and distribution principles, but there's much criticism that this paradigm has reached its limits. Candidate Lee said he'd support 50% of childcare costs for 0-5 year old infants and provide free education costs for children under 5. The expected cost is about 4.5 trillion won [approximately $3.37 billion USD]. Looking at materials from candidate Lee's side, there are ultimately no specific plans - you're essentially arguing that you can also reduce based on what the government claimed.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=Policies have priorities. If you do things without order like the current government, you get fiscal deficits and difficulties. It's hard even with raised taxes. Managing household finances well means discerning what to do first and what's important. In just 20 years, Korea will be an aging society. When an era comes where two people must support one person, potential growth rate falls below 1%. What will happen to the country? The most important current issue is raising the birth rate. While it's an immediate problem, preparing for what might happen in 20-30 years is what the state must do.\\n\\n◇Park Geun-hye's Questions\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=Regarding high school equalization, you said 'We should preserve the basic intent of equalization while partially introducing competition.' Should this be understood as maintaining high school equalization?\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=No. It should depend on regional and school characteristics. Rather than maintaining the status quo, if we leave it to autonomy, there will be those who want it and those who don't.\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=This is the global knowledge-based era. Creative talent is national competitiveness. An era has come where one talent feeds 10,000 to 100,000 people. High school equalization maintained for 30 years has reached its limits. Rather than uniformly tying up students through downward equalization, we need education policies where good students are supported to do better and lagging students are pulled up to do better. In that sense, the most important thing in local autonomy is education autonomy. We shouldn't infringe on parents' choice of what kind of education method they want. I said let's have residents in 16 metropolitan cities and provinces choose whether to maintain or abolish high school equalization through voting. If Seoul voted on whether to maintain or abolish equalization, which side would candidate Lee choose?\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=The fundamental purpose of raising diverse global talent through education autonomy is the same. However, I oppose voting by 16 cities and provinces. If Seoul autonomizes while neighboring Gyeonggi Province equalizes, what happens when a Seoul student goes to Gyeonggi Province? There's also concern that education's direction could be swayed by populism. I think the voting proposal has many problems.\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=I don't think it would be uniform by city and province. I think residents could follow the methods they each want.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=Are you saying we should vote by city or county units as I advocated, rather than metropolitan area voting?\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=Everything has been held by the center until now. This can be entrusted to local governments to reflect residents' will.\\n\\nLee Myung-bak=If it's to be entrusted, since the nature is different, we should discuss it separately.\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=I met Hansen's disease patients at Sorokdo. I thought prejudice and discrimination were bigger problems. What are your policy ideas for disabled people?\\n\\nHong Jun-pyo=The system of paying penalties for not hiring disabled people has achieved considerable results. What's really important is not disabled employment itself but that disabled people need systems where they can advance into small and medium enterprises and build factories of their own. For disabled people's self-reliance, the next government should create corporate structures where disabled people can gather to make workshops and supply products. We should also refrain from prejudiced and disparaging remarks.\\n\\nPark Geun-hye=Technology becomes unusable after just 5 years due to rapid change. There's a point that lifelong education is necessary. That's why foreign countries sometimes merge labor and education ministries. What policy vision do you have for lifelong vocational education?\\n\\nWon Hee-ryong=Average lifespan has become so long that our generation will probably live to 90 or 100. We must lead double-cropped lives. Ultimately, supporting an education system where people can learn again in their 50s and engage in social activities is an important task. We need to shift policy focus from middle and high school education to university and social activities. Japan merged the Ministry of Education and Science and Technology Agency to create the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. I agree. I've conceived a plan to reduce the Ministry of Education's functions, concentrated on entrance exam education, to less than half and consolidate with science and technology to support lifelong education. I don't think we can leave it only to the private sector. Integrated education can become an economic guide for high school students, a field of global economy for university students, and a lifelong vocational center. The national network of lifelong education can be created while finding new roles for national universities.\\n\\nReported by Park Yeon-mi\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 11279, "output_tokens": 5408, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

However, to make a comprehensive assessment, we need to look at both campus-centered public education and free lifelong learning education. I'll focus on public education but also mention free lifelong learning education.\\n\\nRegarding public education, Korean education is still bound to a supplier-centered system. In general education, it's not an education where elementary, middle, and high school students can autonomously and enthusiastically do what they want to do. True ability comes from students autonomously and enthusiastically studying what they want to do, but the reality is still that schools and parents unilaterally demand what they want from students.\\n\\nSchools and parents alike evaluate student abilities with average scores. They begin to evaluate human worth with average scores. Even when a student excels tremendously in a specific field but struggles in others, instead of encouraging them saying 'you're good, you're good' and giving them strength so they could become world-class talent in that area, they average everything out and evaluate based on that average. So students with below-average scores cannot bloom their special potential abilities. This happens because parents align with the demands of suppliers called schools. Ultimately, students and our future suffer damage.\\n\\nWhen I was Deputy Prime Minister of Education, I visited Finland because they were said to be doing very well in education. I visited a prestigious private school and had a conversation with a high school student. When I asked 'What grade are you in?' he didn't understand. I said 'You know, grades, like 2nd or 3rd grade,' and he replied 'Oh, that. I'm at 1st grade level in math and 3rd grade level in art.' I was shocked.\\n\\nI asked 'Don't your parents scold you for being bad at math?' and he said 'No, my parents are proud that I excel in art.' I asked about his friends, and it was the same. That's when I had a great realization. Ability doesn't manifest as an average. How can we help such talent bloom from general education without feeling inferior? That's how we get Picasso, Beethoven, and Einstein. Korean students cannot bloom their potential.\\n\\nLooking at university education, Korean university authorities are almost entirely devoted to admission issues. From the university entrance, they only think about how to select many good students, how to select many 'quality raw materials.' They don't really think about polishing and nurturing even ordinary raw materials to produce excellent talent... They set aside thoughts of producing tremendously excellent talent through university education and focus too much only on securing more good students at the entrance. The more prestigious the university, whether public or private, the more extraordinary attention they pay to admission policies. Meanwhile, most non-prestigious universities say it's difficult even to fill their enrollment quotas.\\n\\nThe most important thing in university education - nurturing decent talent over 4 years, or 8 years including master's and doctoral programs - even if they select decent talent, universities show little interest in the university education that develops them into outstanding talent. So there's no exit policy. There's virtually no college exit examination. There's only college entrance examination.\\n\\nGenerally in Korea, up to high school, we have international competitiveness. In regularly conducted world science, math, and reading tests, we're always in the upper tier among OECD countries. Advanced countries actually fall to the middle tier.\\n\\nBut when we enter university and look at university evaluations, hardly any of our universities make it into the world's top 100. This shows that the competitiveness and quality of university education is terrible. I think this is because we've failed to improve the quality of talent produced by universities.\\n\\nFor reference, the US has been globally excellent in university education. Recently, it seems they're starting to reflect on the quality of American university education. Previously, the US government maintained a hands-off policy regarding university education, but now they're thinking of intervening.\\n\\nAmerican universities are experiencing crisis due to three problems. First, only 63% of freshmen graduate. Second, they're beginning to feel threatened in international competitiveness. Third, tuition is too expensive. Private schools average $133,000 for four years, which is about 130 million won [approximately $100,000 USD] in our money. State universities are also about $65,000 [approximately $50,000 USD]. In this crisis, people like the Texas governor say that for American universities to truly become high-quality universities that can lead the world, they should strictly conduct college exit examinations rather than college entrance examinations.\\n\\nFor example, in Florida, there are state universities and Florida International University. The international university is not well-known and has SAT [US college entrance exam] scores that are about 100 points lower. However, after graduation, the international university students are superior. This serves as evidence.\\n\\nKorea has 600,000 high school graduates per year, right? A small number of prestigious universities mainly select the most excellent students among them. It's as if they line up in front of Seoul National University and select excellent high school seniors in order of university ranking. But these universities must seriously consider whether they can truly nurture the students they select over four years into high-level individuals that society, the market, and the nation demand. They shouldn't seek excellence at the university entrance but should prove excellence at the exit. So ultimately, I see university education as diseased due to supplier selfishness.\\n\\nFor Seoul National University, good students will naturally go there even without admission policies. Even if Seoul National University doesn't announce admission policies and say they'll give perfect scores to students with grade 1 or 2 school records, students are destined to go there anyway. They should focus more on nurturing these young people into world-class talent. Moreover, from the perspective of non-prestigious universities, this looks like selfishness that further worsens the existing university hierarchy. Any university should consider how to make students who enter their school become outstanding talent that the market and world demand. Universities should utilize more of their resources for this.\\n\\nNext, LLL - Life-Long Learning, lifelong education that occurs outside campus - this is tremendously important. Using information technology, to solve problems moment by moment, we must continuously learn new knowledge. We must improve the professional capabilities of the entire population. We must develop the ability to continuously learn and create new knowledge required in changing situations. The existing campus system is insufficient. More national support is needed here. Corporate cooperation is also tremendously necessary. Generally, Korea seems to do well in open education in terms of lifelong learning. Better than campus-centered education.\\n\\nElementary and secondary education: B~C, University education: C~D. Universities only have 'entrance' policies, no 'exit' policies\\n\\n- What do you think is the biggest problem with Korean education?\\n\\n\\\"(Laughing) You want me to give grades? General education (elementary and secondary education) has supplier-oriented characteristics, but from an international competitiveness standpoint, it should be evaluated as doing well. However, from the standpoint of fostering students' creativity, communal humanity, and character development, it's about B or C. University education I'd rate as C or D. LLL (lifelong education) does well. It moves forward more vigorously compared to other countries. I'd give it an A-minus.\\\"\\n\\n- I'll ask about individual educational issues. The three prohibitions policy, school record weighting, CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] discrimination ability, essay exams, and specialized high schools are becoming problems.\\n\\n\\\"Let me first mention two big problems with Korean education before proceeding. First, there are two fundamentally contradictory demands in education. One is the demand for equity and the other is the demand for excellence. The government's position is to contain excellence within the vessel of equity. However, balancing this is very difficult. The problem related to this balance is precisely the three prohibitions issue.\\n\\nIn my view, equity should mainly be pursued and managed at the general education level. Elementary, middle, and high schools should let individual students study what they want to do within the framework of equity. Like Finnish high schools. We must foster creative ability along with communal humans who share hardships together.\\n\\nWhere should excellence be mainly cultivated? Universities should mainly be responsible. Universities should educate with excellence as the center. We confuse this problem, and by overemphasizing excellence in general education, specialized high schools are misused as advance bases for entering first-class universities. So excellence should be pursued in university.\\n\\nThe US has prestigious private boarding schools for securing excellence even in general education. But their total number is very small. On the other hand, once you enter university, whether prestigious private or state universities, they make students study desperately hard. Education up to high school is somewhat relaxed. In high school, they don't make students study desperately for life or death. Once you enter university, whether private or public, just graduating itself becomes a difficult task. There's a lot of homework, and even if you practically live in the library, it's hard to keep up. Graduate school is even more severe.\\n\\nWe too must make students study rigorously after entering university. There's a saying. When I was a university professor in the US, there was a principle for professors: 'publish or perish' (no academic achievements means dismissal), and for students: 'study or perish.' In Korea, at any university, once you're admitted, you almost automatically graduate except for dropping out due to inability to pay tuition. Is Korean university education as scary as American? Whether professors or students...\\n\\nSecond, the problem is that parents' educational suffering is too severe in Korean education. Even for middle-class families, university tuition is expensive. When you think about it, the money that must be spent to send one's child to a first-class prestigious university is demanded from kindergarten onward - that's educational suffering.\\n\\nWhy does this happen? When I became a cabinet member in 1993, on the first day at a cabinet meeting, I counted how many were from my alma mater and roughly over 50% were. Looking at statistics of minister and vice-minister backgrounds since liberation, during President Rhee Syng-man's time there were many who studied abroad, but from the military regime until today, graduates from one university are overwhelmingly numerous. Korea has nearly 200 universities, but from the public's perspective, there are a small number of universities recognized as 'symbols of success and advancement.' The proportion of so-called SKY universities (Seoul National University, Korea University, Yonsei University) is tremendously high. This reality forces parents to spend much on hagwon education to get their children into these prestigious universities. Currently, the proportion of SKY university graduates is two-thirds. This reality increases hagwon education costs along with educational suffering, ultimately shaking public education. This problem must be resolved.\\n\\nUltimately, everything is connected in one line. Which universities oppose the three prohibitions? Mainly a small number of prestigious universities. Universities representing less than 10% of all universities oppose it.\\n\\nBut as I mentioned earlier, a president of Korea's top university once said this: you need good raw materials to make good products. However, there's doubt about how seriously that university considers making the best products.\\n\\nIn short, university education is too lax, inefficient, and uncreative compared to advanced countries. Opposition to the three prohibitions policy stems from prestigious university selfishness. Therefore, rather than criticizing the three prohibitions policy, universities should focus on exit policies to thoroughly educate graduates to become individuals superior to Harvard, Oxford, or Tokyo University graduates.\\n\\nSchool records weighting is the same. Good students will naturally go to Seoul National University even without mentioning school records. It's regrettable that Seoul National University, which operates with significantly more national financial support than other universities, presents policies to more efficiently monopolize better students - this appears to be competing for rice bowls with other first-class universities.\\n\\n- How do you view specialized high schools?\\n\\n\\\"Specialized high schools were created to nurture excellent talent at the general education level. They should nurture excellent talent at the general education level according to their purpose. They don't exist for prestigious university admissions.\\\"\\n\\n- The expansion of specialized high schools is a contentious issue.\\n\\n\\\"I think specialized high schools should be expanded. Even in general education, students who excel in specific areas and have aptitude should be nurtured. Students excellent in physics, chemistry, etc., should have broader paths to reach the highest level universities in those fields. That's necessary. But they must remain faithful to the specialized high school spirit. It's problematic when science high school students enter prestigious university law schools or business schools.\\n\\nHowever, we must think about cases unrelated to specialized high schools. The issue of whether to give perfect scores to grade 1 and 2 school records - if this stems from prestigious university selfishness, then we should now pay attention to the pain of many students from grade 5 to 9 school records. Shouldn't we think about the wounds they receive in their hearts when hearing such talk?\\n\\nIf there are over 100 non-prestigious universities, wouldn't their alienation also be a problem? That's why it's time for universities, whether prestigious or not, to focus on selecting average or decent students and nurturing them into excellent talent over four university years.\\n\\nWhen evaluating universities in the US, they don't look at just college entrance exam scores. The US has thousands of universities. US News & World Report conducts comprehensive evaluations of 220 universities annually. Looking at their evaluation, there are 18 variables. College entrance exam scores are just one of them. University evaluation variables include many things like faculty-student ratios. Prestigious universities have one professor for every 5-6 students. What about us? And how many classes have 20 or fewer students is also a variable. How friends evaluate students, how much alumni donate - these are also important variables. SAT scores aren't like ours where Seoul National University gets 395 out of 400 points, but they present ranges. Out of 1,600 points, Princeton's 75th to 25th percentile is 1,380-1,560 points, Harvard's is 1,400-1,580 points. The distribution of students entering these two universities almost overlaps. Even universities ranking about 10th overall have tremendous overlap (with the top). This means high school seniors don't line up in one line in front of a specific university but form multiple lines from the start.\\n\\nOnce, two students from one high school applied to Harvard. One student had college entrance exam scores 60 points higher. But the student with higher scores was rejected and the one with lower scores was accepted. The parents naturally wrote a complaint letter. The authorities' response was this: Harvard is not a school that selects study bugs. Harvard is a university that educates leaders of society and the nation. Our prestigious university presidents should remember this truth. They should nurture leaders who will lead the nation, people, market, and society - what good is it to select study bugs? High college entrance exam scores don't necessarily mean quality raw materials.\\\"\\n\\nPresidential candidates should present educational blueprints from candidacy. Change the Ministry of Education's role and establish a presidential administrative committee\\n\\n- Educational reform organizations have created reform plans across various governments, but why are we still unsatisfied with educational reality? What would you say are the obstacles to educational reform?\\n\\n\\\"There's responsibility from the government, and teachers, parents, and citizens also bear responsibility. In a presidential system power structure, the president's will is tremendously important.\\n\\nTo reform education, the president must present a clear blueprint for educational reform from when they are a candidate, and once elected, they must firmly stand at the center of consistently pushing it forward until the end of their term. The Minister of Education, who will take practical responsibility for implementation, must pursue it while serving the same term as the president. As you know, the Minister of Education changes most frequently among all ministers. Always swayed by political problems, they couldn't focus on educational issues - this was the problem of all past presidents without exception. They probably realized 'oops, too late' only when stepping down. In the past, whenever education became politicized, they tried to resolve issues by immediately replacing ministers.\\n\\nThis might be the first time I'm saying this, but if we have the president's will, how should we proceed? Educational reform must begin with bold university reform.\\n\\nI served as the first Deputy Prime Minister of Education for exactly one year and one day. During that one year, I wrestled with general education problems and couldn't implement any of the university education reforms I originally planned. When I became the first deputy prime minister in 2001, the media focused criticism on the collapse of Korean public education. They mainly discussed the crisis in general education. Wrestling with those problems... I was regretful that I had to leave just when I was about to seriously address university education problems.\\n\\nTo reform universities, first, we must boldly consolidate the approximately 50 national universities. We should create about 10 regional hub national universities. The government should take complete financial responsibility for hub national universities. The state should take full responsibility for professors' research, salaries, and all facilities.\\n\\nBy concentrating the resources supporting 50 national universities into 10 universities, it can be accomplished. About 10 national universities should become hub universities, but all must be specialized. For example, Seoul National University for natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences that form the foundation of all learning, and other hub universities specialized by field - medicine, agriculture, engineering, marine science, advanced science, etc. Then what phenomenon occurs? From elementary school, if you want to raise your child as a great scientist, you'll try to send them to a specialized university that majors in that field. For instance, if medical school biotechnology is in Gangwon Province [a mountainous province in northeast South Korea], then you send them to Gangwon Province. This way, regarding national universities, students will line up in 10 lines from the start. As long as 600,000 high school graduates line up in one line in front of one university and are selected in hierarchical order, educational suffering cannot be reduced.\\n\\nWhat about private universities? Complete autonomy. Whether they conduct independent exams or how they handle school record grades - it's not the government's business to intervene. Then several effects will emerge. Universities that truly lack competitiveness will close their doors themselves. And for specialized national universities, if students whose parents earn below a certain level of 15 million won [approximately $11,500 USD] and have grade 1 school records receive full 4-year scholarships, excellent students will naturally go to national universities even if poor. Then private universities will benchmark national universities. Private universities will benchmark specialized leading universities on their own without government interference.\\n\\nTo implement university education this way, we must establish a university policy administrative committee directly under the president. The Ministry of Education must change to a better form than now. Since the president must directly oversee it, specialized and regionalized national universities must be successfully fostered. Private universities should have complete autonomy, but supervisory functions to prevent private university corruption must exist.\\n\\nGeneral education should originally be coordinated with local government systems. We must strengthen the power of education superintendents, who are local governments' education officials. Education superintendents should take responsibility and lead. The state just needs to provide necessary financial support. If education superintendents in different regions are exceptional, they could achieve distinctive education. Excellence must be contained within the vessel of equity. Even in that case, specialized university education and specialized high schools should be connected.\\n\\nNow education is economy, and economy is education. Education is most important\\n\\n- Has education been a lower priority for past presidents or presidential candidates?\\n\\n\\\"They know education is important, but above all, they get caught up in political and economic issues. But actually, now education is economy. In the analog era, education and economy seemed separate, but in the digital era, education is economy and economy is education. Because it's a knowledge economy era, education directly connects to economy. In a knowledge-based society, how to systematize and politicize exploding information for national development and high-quality life for the people and society... this is tremendously important. Current presidential candidates are working hard, but they still seem to view education as just one sector's problem. Education is everything.\\\"\\n\\n- What are the causes of educational reform failure?\\n\\n\\\"As I mentioned, there's the point that presidents couldn't meticulously push through from the beginning. Above all, the media bears responsibility. Educational beat reporters always view education as incidents. They view everything from the perspective of incidents... But education is a process. A growth process. Trees grow slowly - trees don't suddenly emerge from grass. The media doesn't seem to seriously recognize education's importance.\\n\\nEarlier when discussing why educational reform hasn't gone well, I mentioned presidents, but there's also the problem of teachers as educational subjects in educational reform. If we divide educational reform into three types, hardware reform is the expansion of educational facilities. Software reform is innovation in curricula and educational content. Third is humanware - the problem of improving teacher quality. In our country, facility problems are directly connected to finances. It's not a complex problem. It's important, but not unclear or ambiguous. Reform at the humanware level is the problem of improving teacher quality, which is very important. Here, many teachers nowadays refuse evaluation. That's wrong. If they truly value true education, they should be evaluated on whether they're truly teachers providing true education. But teachers refuse evaluation? This could be perceived as meaning that even teachers who cannot provide quality education should be protected and remain in educational settings for a long time. The result of such people being protected differs from the spirit of true education. We must institutionally provide incentives to teachers who sacrifice their time to teach students to enhance creativity and improve cooperative ability and innovative leadership. So minimum performance pay is necessary. Now performance pay and teacher evaluation issues should be accepted with more open minds for the realization of true education. Only then can creative education and character education be possible at the general education level. This is the teachers' reform responsibility.\\n\\nKorean parents, please don't evaluate your children only by average scores. Even if the average is 75 points, if they have exceptional qualities in a specific field, applaud and encourage them to become world number one in that field - many such parents should emerge. Don't think about sending them to prestigious universities for success. As I mentioned, if universities become specialized, even without sending children to a small number of prestigious universities, there will be valuable paths to success for children excellent in one or two fields. Now parents must move beyond the level of being proud of doing well on average with average standards. Only then will we get Picasso, Beethoven, and Edison. If Edison were alive now, if Madam Curie existed, what could they do within Korea's educational system?\\\"\\n\\n- How do you view the recent conflicts between universities, the Blue House, and the Ministry of Education?\\n\\n\\\"It's all contained in what I said earlier. The current Ministry of Education must be developmentally readjusted. Now educational functions should be strengthened and their structure should be innovated.\\\"\\n\\n- I'll ask a personal question. You served as deputy prime minister under both the Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung governments.\\n\\n\\\"I supported both Kims as comrades in the democratization process. With one (YS), I exchanged opinions on various policy issues when he was opposition party leader, and with the other (DJ), we went to prison together and suffered hardships. My relationship with both gentlemen is deep. In 1997 when both ran for president simultaneously, I emphasized that one should yield. Candidate unification - when that didn't happen, military authoritarianism was extended as I feared. Later, after YS became president, he didn't ask me to take the Deputy Prime Minister for Unification post from the beginning. (Before YS's inauguration) somehow I came to handle unification issues, and I emphasized sunshine policy then. YS still doesn't like sunshine policy, but at the time he seemed swayed by various staff influences.\\n\\nPresident Kim Dae-jung recognized that there should be a department for human resource development. So while expanding the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, he asked me to serve as the first Deputy Prime Minister of Education. Actually, the core of human resource development is strengthening university education. But as soon as I took office, all media concentrated attacks on general education under the banner of public education collapse, so responding to that meant I couldn't touch university education at all. There's that regret.\\n\\nEducational reform's focus should be on university education. Media should also pay attention to exit rather than entrance policies\\n\\n- If you have more to say about educational policy, please share.\\n\\n\\\"In the 21st century, education is never just one sector's problem. Education isn't one among various sectors. Education is human beings, education is economy, education is peace, education is prosperity. It directly connects to all important socio-structural problems and historical problems. Educational capability is precisely the capability and competitiveness of the nation, people, and market. It's also peace-promoting power. Now we must change our perception of education. Korean educational reform's focus should be on university education. Universities must appropriately and sufficiently nurture creative talent that the market, world, people, and nation truly demand. We should teach relatively freely up to high school and let students do what they want, then in university, educate them so they cannot survive without truly studying. But the media is also a problem in education. I don't understand why there's no interest in exit but only interest in entrance. The future of society and the nation depends on the quality of produced talent.\\\"\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 14402, "output_tokens": 6002, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

She expresses in this way that Junggye-dong's educational conditions are as good as Daechi-dong's. Baek's child attends a hagwon at the Eunhaeng intersection in Junggye-dong.\\n\\nDaechi-dong has the most hagwons nationwide. While Naeooe-dong in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province ranks first for a single dong with 162 hagwons, when combining Daechi 1st-4th dong, the total reaches 387. Junggye 1st-6th dong has nearly 200.\\n\\nMokdong in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, another 'education hub,' has 277 hagwons concentrated there. It's the second-highest after Gangnam-gu.\\n\\nThese three hubs produce exceptionally outstanding results in foreign language high school and Seoul National University admission rates. Among this year's foreign language high school students in Seoul, 29.4% came from these three hubs. Looking at this year's Seoul National University admission numbers, Hwimun High School (16 students) and Dankook University High School (13 students) in Daechi-dong ranked in the upper tier. The report cards of Junggye-dong and Mokdong hubs are also good.\\n\\nEducation hubs have long existed in metropolitan new towns. To the south are Sunae-dong and Jeongja-dong in Bundang-gu, and the Sinchon-dong and Gwiin-dong areas in Dongan-gu, Anyang. To the northwest is Hugok Village in Ilsan New Town.\\n\\nRecently, Pungdeokcheon 2-dong, Sanghyeon-dong, and Seongbok-dong in Suji-gu, Yongin have emerged as new hubs. In Pungdeokcheon 2-dong (Suji 2 residential development district), 64 hagwons are concentrated near the Yongin Women's Center and Samsung Apartments, and Sanghyeon-dong has many hagwons centered around apartment complexes near Solgae Elementary School.\\n\\nPungdeokcheon 2-dong has Suji High School, which sent 10 students to Seoul National University this year. Nearby Pungdeokcheon High School is also preferred by students. Since Suji is a non-equalized zone, students need good joint examination scores and school records [GPA] to attend their desired schools. For foreign language high schools, many go to Yongin HUFS High School and Myeongji Foreign Language High School in Uiwang. HUFS High School allocates 105 spots, 30% of its quota, to Yongin residents.\\n\\nMyeongji Foreign Language High School is more popular with Seoul students. While 14 students from Yongin entered Myeongji Foreign Language High School this year, 101 Seoul students enrolled. Some Yongin students also go to Jinseong High School in Gwangmyeong, which has dormitories, or Yangseo High School in Yangpyeong County, an autonomous school.\\n\\nSang 3-dong in Wonmi-gu, Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province has also begun taking on the characteristics of an emerging education hub since 4-5 years ago. Hagwons are concentrated in residential areas near the nearby Save Zone outlet. Sang 3-dong has about 60 hagwons in total.\\n\\nSince Bucheon has no special purpose high schools, many students go to Myeongdeok Foreign Language High School in Mokdong, Seoul, or Anyang Foreign Language High School. Both schools operate shuttle buses to Bucheon. For science high schools, they mainly go to Uijeongbu Science High School. For general high schools, many go to Gyenam High School in Jungdong New Town and Bucheon High School and Bucheon Girls' High School near the new town.\\n\\nDongsan High School in Ansan, which has dormitories, is also one of the schools students prefer. Among Gyeonggi Province high schools, it has the second-highest Seoul National University admission rate this year after Gyeonggi Science High School.\\n\\nHan Seok-hee, director of Ferma Hagwon in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, said, \\\"Although Ansan is also emerging as a popular area, when children reach high school age, parents try to move to Bundang or Yongin Suji.\\\"\\n\\nIn Incheon, Dongchun-dong in Yeonsu-gu is receiving attention as a new education hub as a new town was built. With the creation of Songdo International City, Dongchun-dong's popularity continues to soar. Yeonsu High School, which many Dongchun-dong students attend, sent 9 students to Seoul National University this year. Excluding Incheon Science High School (14 students), a special purpose high school, it produces the most Seoul National University admissions in Incheon.\\n\\nBusan-South Gyeongsang Province\\n\\nGimhae Naeooe-dong, 162 hagwons... Top tier nationwide\\n\\nTraditionally in South Gyeongsang Province, Masan High School and Jinju High School had built reputations as prestigious schools, but they have been in decline since equalization in the early 1980s. Then from the late 1990s, Sangnam-dong in Changwon established itself as an education hub, and now Naeooe-dong in Gimhae has emerged as the new education center.\\n\\nAccording to Statistics Korea data (2006), Naeooe-dong in Gimhae has 162 hagwons. The Statistics Korea survey found it has the most hagwons nationwide for a single dong. Resident Hwang Geum-ho (43, Renault Samsung Motors branch manager) said, \\\"As students from Naeooe-dong's 10,000 apartment households, the old city center, and urban areas of Gimhae including Samgye-dong flocked to Naeooe-dong's central commercial district, famous hagwons rapidly increased.\\\"\\n\\nThe advantage is also that roads connecting to Busan and Changwon are linked to Naeooe-dong. Gyeongwon Middle School and Gimhae High School in Naeooe-dong are popular with parents.\\n\\nThe Sangnam-dong area in Changwon also receives attention as a traditional education hub. Hagwons with over 1,000 students are lined up. Parent Shin Su-ja (45, female) said, \\\"When Towol Sungwon Apartments and Daedong Apartments were built in the late 1990s, over 10,000 households moved in, and many professionals like lawyers and doctors live there.\\\" Ungnam Middle School, Changwon Nam High School, and Jungang Girls' High School are emerging as new prestigious schools.\\n\\nIn Busan, Haeundae-gu and Geumjeong-gu continue the tradition of education hubs. The educational fervor is particularly hot in the new town areas of BEXCO and Jangsan Station in Haeundae-gu. Near Jangsan Station, many mixed-use buildings are being constructed.\\n\\nIn Geumjeong-gu, the area around Lotte Castle Apartments near Guseo Station has established itself as an education hub. Additionally, areas near Busan National University of Education in Geoje-dong, Yeonje-gu are newly emerging.\\n\\nDaegu-Ulsan\\n\\nDaegu Wolseong-dong challenges the supremacy of Beomeo-dong\\n\\nIn Daegu, while Suseong-gu maintains its reputation as a traditional education hub, the Wolseong-dong and Sangin-dong areas in Dalseo-gu have emerged as new education centers since three years ago. Behind this change are large-scale apartment complexes in the Wolseong-dong area.\\n\\nCurrently, about 107,000 households and 400,000 people live in the areas of Sangin, Daegok, and Songhyeon-dong around Wolseong-dong. Kim Sang-do, a supervisor at Daegu Southern Office of Education, said, \\\"The Wolseong-dong area is concentrated with middle class including civil servants, bank employees, and small business owners who have very high interest in children's education, and as parents' preferences rise, housing prices are also trending upward.\\\"\\n\\nAround Lotte Department Store in Sangin-dong, subject-specific hagwons for Korean, English, and math, comprehensive classes, and essay-writing exam hagwons are concentrated, leading the hagwon education [hagwon/tutoring industry] market. Thanks to these conditions, the Seoul National University admission records of Daegeon High School, Yeungnam High School, and Sangin High School in this area are good.\\n\\nHowever, the Beomeo-dong area in Suseong-gu still holds a firm position as Daegu's education center. Gyeongsin High School got 20 students into Seoul National University this year, ranking 11th nationwide. This is more than double Daegeon High School's 9 students in Wolseong-dong.\\n\\nIn Ulsan, the Okdong and Sinjeong-dong areas in Nam-gu are renowned as traditional education hubs. The Ulsan District Court and Ulsan District Prosecutor's Office are located there, and many highly educated middle-class residents live there. Ulsan Grand Park is nearby. Sinjeong Middle School, Okdong Middle School, and Hakseong High School are famous.\\n\\nHakseong High School sent 7 students to Seoul National University this year. The Okdong area has 129 hagwons concentrated there, the third-most nationwide. Many students from the Okdong area are said to enter Hyundai Cheongun High School (Dong-gu, Ulsan), one of six autonomous private high schools.\\n\\nHonam-Jeju\\n\\nGwangju Ilgok-dong, Jeonju Hyoja-dong 'Honam's top two'\\n\\nIlgok-dong in Buk-gu is considered Gwangju Metropolitan City's education center. Large-scale residential development began in the 1990s, and nearby Sungil High School and Salesio High School established themselves as regional prestigious schools. The two schools got 7 and 6 students respectively into Seoul National University this year. In terms of Seoul National University admissions, they correspond to Gwangju's 1st and 2nd place.\\n\\nRecently, Bongseon-dong in Nam-gu is rising. Bongseon-dong, with about 10,000 households, has about 100 thriving hagwons. So it's known as the hagwon center. Since Gwangju has no foreign language high school, outstanding students sometimes leave for metropolitan area or Busan science high schools, or Sangsan High School in Jeonju. Bongseon Middle School sent 2 students to Busan Science High School last year.\\n\\nIn South Jeolla Province, Mokpo's educational fervor is hot. Yonghae-dong, Mokpo's old city center, has more houses than apartments. Traditional prestigious schools like Mokpo High School and Mokpo Girls' High School are located here. In Sang-dong's case, as new towns were created centered around apartments, nearby Yeongheung High School and Jeil and Hadang Middle Schools are gaining popularity.\\n\\nGwangyang Jecheon High School, an autonomous private high school (7 Seoul National University admissions), operates an innovative scholarship system and has high preference among excellent students. There are cases of moving from Gwangju or Mokpo to rural areas targeting the school's rural student admission track.\\n\\nIn North Jeolla Province, Hyoja-dong in Wansan-gu, Jeonju is the center of education. Hyoja-dong has Jeonju Sangsan High School, an autonomous private high school, and 129 concentrated hagwons. Sangsan High School produced 17 Seoul National University admissions this year, ranking first in the entire Honam region.\\n\\nIn Iksan, North Jeolla Province, after the mayor publicly declared he would create 'Korea's education center,' the city is pursuing a 5-year education reform plan at the municipal level. Yeongdeung 1-dong, where Namseong High School and Namseong Girls' High School are located, is also considered an education center.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Jeju, education towns are formed centered around Ildo 2-dong or Nohyeong-dong where large apartment complexes are built. Daegi High School and Sinseong Girls' High School are popular.\\n\\nDaejeon-North Chungcheong Province\\n\\n'Daejeon's 8th School District' is Dunsan-dong and Noeun-dong\\n\\nThe most expensive neighborhoods in Daejeon are Dunsan-dong in Seo-gu and Noeun-dong in Yuseong-gu. Daejeon's education valley matches the expensive housing areas. So Dunsan-dong and Noeun-dong are sometimes called 'Daejeon's 8th School District.'\\n\\nDunsan-dong began full-scale new town development in 1992, and many high schools from the old city center relocated there. Among them, Chungnam High School and Dunsan Girls' High School are highly preferred. Chungnam High School got 8 students into Seoul National University this year.\\n\\nWhat made Dunsan the education center was also the concentration of large college entrance exam hagwons. Competition among hagwons is fierce in this area. About 10 college entrance exam hagwons that own buildings operate large buses to attract students from Dong-gu and Jung-gu.\\n\\nIn Noeun district in Yuseong-gu near the administrative complex city, a hagwon district comparable to Dunsan-dong has recently formed. About 30% of parents at Yuseong High School, the representative high school here, and nearby Daedeok High School in Daedeok Special Zone are Daedeok Complex researchers or doctors and lawyers. In this year's Seoul National University admissions, both schools produced 9 admissions each.\\n\\nDaejeon Foreign Language High School, which also produced 9 Seoul National University admissions, is located in Nae-dong, Seo-gu, close to Dunsan-dong.\\n\\nAbout half of Daejeon Foreign Language High School students have their addresses in Dunsan-dong and Noeun-dong.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, Gagyeong-dong in Heungdeok-gu and Yongam-dong in Sangdang-gu form a rivalry. Both are located in Cheongju's emerging residential complexes. Particularly in Heungdeok-gu, high schools representing the region including Segwang High School, Cheongju High School, and Seowon High School are concentrated. This year, 16 students from Segwang High School were admitted to Seoul National University. Cheongju High School and Seowon High School each sent 5 students to Seoul National University.\\n\\nNon-equalized South Chungcheong-Gangwon-North Gyeongsang Provinces\\n\\nTraditional prestigious schools' reputations still alive\\n\\nSouth Chungcheong, Gangwon, and North Gyeongsang Provinces are non-equalized regions. Schools like Gongju Teachers' College High School, Chuncheon High School, and Pohang High School are still established as prestigious schools. However, since three years ago, students in these regions are not satisfied with prestigious schools alone and are turning their eyes to metropolitan special purpose high schools and autonomous private high schools. Parents continuously demand the establishment of special purpose high schools in their regions. As special purpose high schools join existing prestigious schools, students' range of choices is expanding.\\n\\nIn Gangwon Province, Seoksa-dong in Chuncheon, a newly developed area, has been attracting students since three years ago. At its center are Chuncheon High School and Chuncheon Girls' High School. Moreover, Seoksa-dong is rare in Gangwon Province for having concentrated medium and large apartments and well-equipped advanced sports and cultural facilities. Special purpose high school specialized hagwons, famous college entrance exam hagwons, and essay-writing exam hagwons moved from existing concentrated areas like Toegye-dong to Seoksa-dong. As educational and living conditions improved, professionals like doctors and lawyers flocked there. Some even move from Wonju.\\n\\nFor middle schools, Daeryong Middle School and nearby Namchuncheon Middle School and Namchuncheon Girls' Middle School in Toegye-dong are gaining fame. Han Yun-sil (45, female, hagwon director) who lives in Toegye-dong said, \\\"I moved my hagwon from Hupyeong-dong to Toegye-dong 10 years ago, then moved to Seoksa-dong when medium and large apartments were built in Seoksa-dong three years ago.\\\"\\n\\nIn Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, Daei-dong is called an emerging education hub. As a new town was built, famous hagwons moved in en masse. The Duho-dong area in Buk-gu is a traditional education hub. Students living in Daei-dong or Duho-dong often go to Pohang High School and Pohang Girls' High School. Pohang Jecheon High School established by POSCO also has high preference.\\n\\nSouth Chungcheong Province has good accessibility, so excellent students from across the nation flock there. Traditional prestigious Gongju Teachers' College High School, Gongju Hanil High School (an autonomous school), and Cheonan Bukil High School established by Hanwha Group attract popularity. Ssangyong-dong in Cheonan, where large-scale apartment complexes were built, has emerged as a new education hub. In Yongam Village in Ssangyong-dong, famous hagwons are concentrated, and because it's close to the metropolitan area, many places have famous Seoul instructors teaching. Hagwon fees tend to be more expensive than in Daejeon.\\n\\nJoint reporting team of JoongAng Ilbo and JoongAng Sunday\\nSeoul-Gyeonggi = reporters Shin Seong-sik, Kang In-seok, Lee Won-jin, intern reporter Kim Ju-min\\nRegional areas = reporters Lee Chan-ho, Lee Gi-won, Hong Gwon-sam, Cheon Chang-hwan, Shin Jin-ho.\"\n}\n```", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 7542, "output_tokens": 4713, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

At 1 PM, teacher Lena Pasquowitz's children chatter excitedly as they wait for their fun lunch time. Kalei Raiken (6) brought a pink Hello Kitty lunch bag that her mother packed deliciously.\\n\\nStrawberry yogurt, long string cheese, some vegetables, and cookies. But the staple food that children love to eat is missing. There's no peanut butter jelly sandwich in sight. Kalei was diagnosed with peanut and tree nut allergies when she was only 7 months old. Tree nuts are absolutely prohibited at this child's seat in Mercer's cafeteria.\\n\\nWhile friends without allergies are allowed to sit together, this is only possible after teachers carefully inspect their lunch boxes stored in special containers. Kalei's home is also a nut-free zone. Even during the recent Halloween when she went around the neighborhood playing 'trick or treat,' candy was scarier than any costume.\\n\\nThis was because it might have been contaminated with peanut residue. For mother Erica Friedman, who has allergies in two other children besides Kalei, food sometimes feels like an enemy. \\\"I plan everything,\\\" Friedman said. \\\"It's our job to keep the children safe. Actually, it's everyone's job.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a time when food allergies couldn't attract the attention of the medical community. Currently, many scientists say that about 11 million Americans suffer from food allergies, and the number is gradually increasing. Most importantly, peanut allergies among children under five doubled between 1997-2002, among the scary allergies.\\n\\n\\\"The number has definitely increased in children,\\\" said Dr. Hugh Sampson, who conducts pioneering food allergy research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York). \\\"I think it will increase overall in the future.\\\"\\n\\nAllergy specialists say there has been an unprecedented increase in children with complex allergies who show adverse reactions not only to staples from the 1950s like milk and flour, but also to global foods like sesame and kiwi that have since established themselves on American tables. Even egg allergies, which most children naturally recover from as they grow up, seem to last longer than in the past.\\n\\nParents with very young children become nervous every time new foods are introduced. They must watch for the first signs of symptoms such as rashes, diarrhea, or vomiting. While deaths from allergies are rare, very sensitive children can have their throats swell and become completely blocked when wrongly exposed to food.\\n\\nEven if your child doesn't have allergies, you must be careful not to inadvertently cause allergic reactions in your child's friends or classmates. Nowadays, dairy-free birthday cakes are essential, and peanut-free Halloween parties are the same.\\n\\nWhat causes the increase in allergy patients? The most interesting theory, nicknamed the \\\"hygiene hypothesis,\\\" explains that we have become too clean. The immune system is designed to fight dangerous external invaders like parasites, viruses, and infections. However, clean water, antibiotics, and vaccines have eliminated several harmful challengers.\\n\\nThere's even interesting research suggesting that children born through cesarean sections, which have increased 40% over the past 10 years, have a higher risk of developing allergies. This may be because they were never exposed to healthy bacteria while passing through the mother's birth canal. The theory is that because there are no serious enemies, the immune system instead begins battling harmless things like eggs or wheat.\\n\\nAlmost everyone has had to adapt to the increase in food allergies. Children with allergies carry portable EpiPens containing epinephrine injections to administer in case of severe symptoms. Many schools like Mercer Elementary have designated \\\"peanut-free zones\\\" where allergic students can eat with peace of mind.\\n\\nThe number of states establishing allergy guidelines is also increasing. Thanks to federal law implemented last year, food manufacturers now clearly label the eight most common allergens (milk, fish, etc.) on their food labels. Many airlines serve pretzels instead of peanuts to passengers.\\n\\nWhile scientists basically understand the process of allergy outbreak, they can only surrender when faced with the wall of the immune system. It's too complex for scientists to control. There is no cure for food allergies. There are only treatments for some symptoms. The best measure parents and children can take is to avoid the culprit.\\n\\nHowever, interesting progress has recently begun to be made in research. Researchers are thinking of radical methods. The idea is to expose people to harmful components in advance to see if it's possible to treat or even prevent food allergy symptoms. In one study, children with peanut allergies were given small amounts of peanut powder to see if immunity developed.\\n\\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a five-year 'Food Allergy Research Consortium' (CoFAR) in 2005 with $17 million [approximately $13 million USD].\\n\\nIn another study supported by this consortium, researchers plan to give adults with peanut allergies small amounts of processed peanut protein to prevent allergic reactions and, if successful, eliminate the problem. In short, developing a peanut allergy vaccine is the ultimate goal. For Sampson, who is researching this, the search for a solution is more urgent than ever. \\\"The situation is urgent,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIt's not easy to figure out how childhood pleasures like peanut butter sandwiches, warm chocolate chip cookies, and a cold glass of milk put small bodies into battle mode.\\n\\nHow can just one bite make your throat itchy, lips swell, and stomach suffer painful cramps? How does an immune system elaborately designed to protect us from bacteria and viruses regard healthy nutrients as enemies?\\n\\nBrothers Brian Berning (13) and Daniel (11), who live in Lake Forest, Illinois, know well how it feels to be attacked like that. When Brian was about 6 months old, his body resisted after taking a sip of milk-based formula. \\\"His lips swelled and his eyes rolled back,\\\" said mother Denise.\\n\\nThe list of foods the two boys can't eat includes eggs, tree nuts (including cashews, walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts), milk, and shellfish or crustaceans. Daniel was diagnosed with allergy-related esophageal disease last March. So he can only eat apples and bacon. Now he absorbs most nutrients through tubes.\\n\\n\\\"It's really painful when I go to parties. I have to watch my friends eat ice cream cake while saying it's delicious,\\\" Daniel said. \\\"When they say 'Daniel, this is really delicious,' I answer 'I can't eat it because of food allergies.'\\\"\\n\\nExactly what causes food allergies is unknown. It's clear that genetic combinations (allergies are hereditary) and environment play a role. When a person prone to allergies encounters objects like pollen or peanuts, a series of events begins.\\n\\nThe body recognizes it as a problem and begins a first-stage attack: the production of antibodies called IgE (immunoglobulin E). These molecules attach to mast cells around the lungs, intestines, skin, mouth, nose, and cavities (empty spaces in the body).\\n\\nWhen that person next encounters pollen or peanuts, the mast cells prepare for war and release powerful chemicals like histamine. This causes nasty allergic symptoms like sneezing, stomach cramps, itching, nasal congestion, swelling, and hives.\\n\\nIn rare cases, if the reaction against antigens is sudden and violent, the airways can close completely, blood pressure drops, and anaphylaxis (hypersensitivity) symptoms occur. If not immediately treated with hormones (epinephrine) that open airways and enhance heart function, shock death can occur.\\n\\nAs interesting research to discover the causes of allergies progresses, the hygiene hypothesis gains credibility. Research results show that children raised on farms are less likely to develop allergies because they constantly contact soil and animals. Canadian research published in early October also showed that rural children have a lower risk of developing asthma.\\n\\nScientists at Duke University studied this phenomenon at the molecular level. They compared the immune systems of wild rodents infected with parasites and diseases with their clean cousins raised in laboratories. Researchers put animal immune cells in petri dishes in an environment that simulates allergic reactions, then administered plant proteins known as immune system stimulants and observed cellular responses.\\n\\nThe results were published last year. The immune response of laboratory rodents was much higher than their wild relatives. The laboratory animals' immune systems worked too hard. The wild animals' blood, which showed little response to stimulation, had high antibody levels. This was evidence that they had already fought much scarier enemies and wouldn't bother with trivial opponents.\\n\\n\\\"Wild animals are thought not to get allergies,\\\" said William Parker, who led the investigation. \\\"They're too busy fighting scary liver parasites to worry about things like pollen.\\\" Parker said parasites might eventually help scientists discover treatments.\\n\\nResearch results showed that patients with irritable bowel syndrome sometimes improved their symptoms when exposed to a parasite called pig whipworm. Parker wants to find out if similar controlled exposure might work to \\\"stimulate the immune system in a good direction\\\" for children with allergies. No one has conducted such research yet. However, theoretically it's \\\"very promising,\\\" he said.\\n\\nEvery immunologist's dream is to fix the immune system so it can always identify allies and enemies with perfect accuracy. Unfortunately, researchers still lack sufficient knowledge to make that dream a reality. What if we made the immune system less sensitive so children could better accept allergy-triggering foods?\\n\\nThat medical technique, called immunotherapy, has established itself as the standard treatment for seasonal allergies like hay fever. Patients receive allergy shots containing small amounts of the problematic substance (weed or tree pollen) while gradually increasing the amount. This way, the immune system gradually becomes familiar with the antigen.\\n\\nResearchers experimented with injection immunotherapy for food allergies, but it wasn't safe. Patients could develop hives or other adverse reactions. Scientists led by Duke University doctor Wesley Burks began carefully experimenting with oral immunotherapy rather than needles and started getting good results.\\n\\nIn a small study published in the January issue of the 'Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,' Burks and Arkansas Children's Hospital doctor Stacy Jones reported that immunotherapy helped calm allergic reactions in children sensitive to eggs.\\n\\nAfter taking small amounts of egg powder in increasing quantities for two years, most children were able to eat the equivalent of two eggs without any side effects. A similar study published in the October journal 'Allergy' also showed children developed egg tolerance. However, when powder consumption stopped, the effect also disappeared.\\n\\nBurks uses the same method with peanuts. He gradually gave children with peanut allergies special powder containing small amounts of peanut protein in increasing amounts. The initial dose was 1/1000th of one peanut. The children slowly adapted to one peanut per day.\\n\\nEarly in the experiment, subject Noah Sheffer (7) immediately vomited after eating just 25mg of peanut protein, equivalent to about 1/12th of one peanut. However, in a food challenge test last May, the boy ate the equivalent of 13 peanuts without any problems.\\n\\nBurks said these results don't mean Noah can now eat Snickers bars to his heart's content. Absolutely not. However, the newly developed tolerance might protect him if he accidentally takes a bite. Noah's mother Robin Smith said she no longer worries about terrible things happening. \\\"I've completely lost that fear.\\\"\\n\\nBurks' peanut powder is like a predecessor to the peanut vaccine that researchers hope to develop in the future. Burks and Sampson joined forces to develop a substance containing proteins that look like peanuts but are actually made to be less powerful than peanuts, and therefore less likely to trigger allergic reactions in patients. So far, they've successfully tested that preparation on mice. \\\"If it works on humans too, there's hope for blocking allergic reactions,\\\" Sampson said.\\n\\nThere are still many mysteries about how allergies start and sometimes why they just disappear. Researchers know that babies with egg or milk allergies and dermatitis are more likely to develop other allergic diseases later as they grow up.\\n\\nLook at Emily Godwin. Both parents have no food allergies, but Emily developed dermatitis at 3 months old. Five months later, doctors diagnosed food allergies. Now six years old, Emily can't eat eggs, wheat, tree nuts, or grapes.\\n\\nHowever, she recently overcame her milk allergy. In fact, many children naturally overcome milk and egg allergies. This is also a mystery that doctors don't understand. Mount Sinai and four other research teams supported by CoFAR are currently recruiting 400 infants with milk or egg allergies.\\n\\nThese infants will be investigated over the next five years to see how many develop peanut allergies and how many naturally cure their milk or egg allergies. The goal of this research is to better understand at the molecular level what causes allergies and what makes them disappear. Eventually, that knowledge could lead to treatments.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is still to prevent allergies from occurring in the first place. Professor Gideon Lack of King's College London discovered an interesting paradox after studying allergy cases worldwide. Countries like the United States that teach children to avoid peanuts from an early age have seen the greatest increase in peanut allergies. Meanwhile, some Asian and African countries where children eat various peanut products from a very young age had much fewer peanut allergies.\\n\\nNow Professor Lack is conducting a groundbreaking experiment by gathering more than 200 babies known to have dermatitis or egg allergies but no peanut allergies. One group is given peanut-containing snacks, while the other group is not given peanuts.\\n\\nThen he plans to observe them until they turn five to see if peanut allergies were prevented before taking root. \\\"I'm thinking of trying to intervene in the first year of life,\\\" Lack said. If successful with peanuts, there's room to expand to other foods.\\n\\nLack was careful not to make hasty predictions and warned that no one knows whether avoidance or exposure will prove to be the best method. \\\"I don't want to give the impression that feeding peanuts is a safe way to prevent peanut allergies. Because we actually don't know.\\\"\\n\\nIf parents try to feed peanuts early at home, there are \\\"risk factors,\\\" he said. If this research succeeds, a major shift in medical advice is expected.\\n\\nFor now, parents have no choice but to be extremely careful. \\\"They always feel like they're walking on eggshells,\\\" said Representative Nita Lowey, who proposed the federal labeling law. Labels that require clear ingredient disclosure (\\\"milk\\\" instead of the technical term \\\"casein\\\") so general consumers, not scientists, can easily understand are helpful.\\n\\nOrganizations like the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) applauded the measure. The nonprofit citizen group FAAN still worries about hidden threats. Schools sometimes store crayons in empty peanut butter containers. Certain paints contain egg components.\\n\\nEven if microwave popcorn labels say they contain milk, eggs, and fish, children with allergic symptoms who don't read them carefully are put at risk.\\n\\nAt home, parents manage their children's food. The problem is food safety outside the home. Ann Bullard, who runs Gwynn Valley Camp in Brevard, North Carolina, recalled worry-free days of the past. \\\"Twenty years ago, we put peanut butter out in the dining hall for anyone to eat. Now we can't do that.\\\"\\n\\nNowadays, even if only 1% of the 1,050 children coming to camp have food allergies, the dining hall uses nut-free products. On evenings when they eat macaroni and cheese, they provide dairy-free alternatives for those who can't eat dairy products.\\n\\nAllergy response methods vary by school. Julie Forest, who lives in Wyckoff, New Jersey, transferred her seven-year-old son who has peanut and tree nut allergies. This was because she heard from the principal of his previous school that they couldn't guarantee the child's safety.\\n\\nAccording to a report published in October, two-thirds of surveyed schools have established allergy emergency plans. However, most measures are \\\"missing basic essential elements\\\" such as emergency contact information or student medical history files. Schools aren't the only ones being lax.\\n\\nSome restaurant chains try not to use nut products (Burger King occasionally sells nut-containing pies that arrive in sealed containers), but other chains don't pay such attention. Another study published last July showed that even parents with allergic children increasingly ignore labels saying \\\"may contain.\\\"\\n\\n75% of parents say they read labels at supermarkets, compared to 85% in 2003. Now warnings are so common that another problem may have arisen. There are too many labeled foods, making it difficult to know which ones are dangerous.\\n\\n\\\"Suddenly these words come out: 'Made on equipment used to make peanuts.' Does anyone know what that means?\\\" said Mike Reid, who lives in Houston. His son Andrew (7) can't eat peanuts. \\\"We need uniform standards instead of forty unclear expressions of 'maybe yes, maybe no.'\\\"\\n\\nStill, there are people who greatly contribute to the fight against allergic reactions. Schools that completely prohibit peanut importation increased from 13% in 2005 to 18%.\\n\\nAt Mercer Elementary School, where Kalei Raiken and eleven other students suffer from severe food allergies, teachers and bus drivers have been trained to use EpiPens, and teachers explain allergies not only to students with allergies but to all students in the school.\\n\\nIn Connecticut, this is law. According to hagwon guidelines [Note: This appears to be an error in the original Korean text - it should be \\\"school guidelines\\\" based on context] established by this state, teachers must teach students about allergies. This prevents them from, for example, bullying classmates who can't eat grilled cheese sandwiches. Massachusetts, Vermont, and Tennessee also have allergy-related school guidelines.\\n\\nThis year, New York and New Jersey began creating their own guidelines. A federal bill in preparation would expand this further by providing up to $50,000 [approximately $38,000 USD] to each school and encouraging voluntary implementation of uniform guidelines so parents don't have to start the education process over from the beginning when students graduate or move to other states.\\n\\nAs awareness increases, some people wonder if food allergies might be exaggerated. While there are quite many children with allergies, less than 1% of children under five have peanut allergies, and 100-200 people annually die from severe side effects.\\n\\nParents who have become accustomed to receiving sensitive warnings from pediatricians to prevent their children from eating nuts and eggs may be unnecessarily frightened. Developing hives or stomach aches after lunch doesn't necessarily mean allergies.\\n\\nFor example, people who are lactose intolerant can't digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and experience cramps or gas in their stomachs. Meanwhile, people with milk allergies have immune systems that identify milk protein as a risk factor and fight against it.\\n\\nAllergy specialists say quite many children are told to avoid even foods that don't cause allergies. \\\"Research shows that up to 25% of parents think their children might have food allergies,\\\" said Dr. David Fleischer of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center (Denver). \\\"But only about 8% are confirmed as fact.\\\"\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis requires time, skill, and patience. Allergy skin tests are extremely sensitive. About 60% overestimate the number of people who will react. Blood tests combined with carefully recorded symptom logs are even better.\\n\\nWhen doctors see how many antibodies against specific food antigens have developed in the blood, it helps predict the risk of children developing allergies. The only way to definitively diagnose allergies is through food challenge tests. Doctors give patients small amounts of suspected eggs, wheat, or seafood and monitor them closely while checking for reactions.\\n\\nKnowing in advance whether allergies exist relieves the burden on both parents and children. \\\"If there's no need to avoid certain foods, the fact that family life has returned to normal is a great comfort,\\\" Fleischer said.\\n\\nIf science succeeds, that normal reality might someday come to child allergy patients. Last year, researchers at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center announced they had identified genes that protect mice from serious skin allergic reactions.\\n\\nResearchers at Mount Sinai blocked allergic reactions in mice for 6 months, equivalent to a quarter of a mouse's lifespan, using herbal preparations. Now they're thinking of testing on humans. Sampson predicted that someday it might be possible to screen children's genes and intervene before itching or sneezing begins if risk is determined.\\n\\nHowever, for now, this remains a pipe dream. Brian Berning's wish isn't so grand. He wants to grow up quickly and when his egg allergy disappears, eat \\\"anything sweet\\\" to his heart's content. Among the things he most wants to eat is birthday cake. After all that suffering, he deserves to be allowed to eat cake to his heart's content.\\n\\nWith KAREN SPRINGEN, JOAN RAYMOND in Shaker Heights and MARY CARMICHAEL\\nCLAUDIA KALB reporter\\nMore magazine articles\\n[J-Hot] U.S. counterintelligence network with holes from desperately sought Middle Eastern female operative\\n[J-Hot] Man who made 2.5 trillion won [approximately $1.9 billion USD] thanks to subprime\\n[J-Hot] Bonds bought when buying houses, don't just sell them\\n[J-Hot] Location where 'BBK Korean back contract' stamp was made revealed\\n[J-Hot] Lee Cheon-soo sued for allegedly assaulting bar madam before departure\\n[J-Hot] Vice Prime Minister who caused confusion for 500,000 people without a single apology\\n[J-Hot] 'Misuda' Christina marries Korean boyfriend today\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 12747, "output_tokens": 5204, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

Including young people who drift between irregular jobs living lives barely different from unemployment, the estimate far exceeds 3 million. What kind of daily life do they actually lead? How to live as unemployed in the Republic of Korea—.\\n\\n\\\"Has my unemployed life lasted over 10 years? Should I say I've become accustomed to it now? I'm starting to think living like this isn't so bad after all.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Jeong, 36 years old and unemployed for 10 years, exhaled cigarette smoke slowly and smiled bitterly. He wore faded old jeans and an outdated coat, with a backpack on his back that seemed more suitable for a student much younger than his age.\\n\\nWhile friends his age would be wrestling with work in suits and ties at this hour, he stood idly in a corner of the National Library. Jeong graduated with a degree in rehabilitation studies. After graduation, he prepared for both Level 5 and Level 7 civil service exams. He once even tried the journalist exam. He never knocked on corporate doors. He said companies didn't seem to fit him, so he didn't even submit applications. When asked what he wanted to do in the future, he couldn't give a clear answer. His eyes behind black-rimmed glasses grew slightly dim.\\n\\n\\\"Right now I don't have anything I particularly want to do... Since I've been without work for so long, I feel my family's disapproving glances. My family keeps nagging me to prepare for the CPA [Certified Public Accountant] exam, so I'm pretending to study. I'm not really putting in serious effort though.\\\"\\n\\nLeaving behind words that he wanted to try working in the field using his major, he left his seat. The library on a weekday afternoon approaching 3 PM was bustling with people of various ages, from university students with textbooks in hand to middle-aged people with graying hair. When approaching people who appeared to be in their 30s, about seven out of ten were college-educated young unemployed.\\n\\nThough the duration of their unemployment varied, all carried vague anxiety about an uncertain future. Moving to the library's rest area, I approached a man eating a sandwich alone. Mr. Kim (29), who graduated in 1999 class and had been unemployed for two years since graduation, was having a late lunch.\\n\\n\\\"After graduation, I made quite an effort to get a job at a company related to my major when I seriously started job hunting, but it didn't go as well as I thought. The company the school connected me with didn't have good working conditions. My home is in Gyeonggi Province [a province surrounding Seoul], but my school was in Chungcheong Province [a central region of Korea], so they arranged jobs with companies in that region.\\\"\\n\\nAfter failing to find employment, he has been continuously preparing for the mechanical design engineer certification exam. His plan is to take the mechanical civil service exam after getting the certification, or if that doesn't work out, to challenge companies again with the certification. This year he failed the exam and has to wait until next year, which darkened his expression.\\n\\n\\\"I come here because I can read books for free. I don't need to buy them. I leave home at 9 AM and study until 7 PM. When I'm at home, even casual comments from family members often hurt or bother me, so I keep coming outside.\\\"\\n\\nThough he leaves home feeling uncomfortable, there aren't many suitable places to go. Those who haven't found jobs after graduation hesitate to return to their university libraries because they fear running into acquaintances. Eventually, they end up using nearby public libraries.\\n\\n**Local universities are pitiful, but prestigious universities are struggling too**\\n\\n\\\"My father runs a small company that makes baking machinery. There are only two employees, so I sometimes help out. It's physically demanding work and he's getting older, so he should rest now... If his three children earned money, he wouldn't need to work...\\\"\\n\\nAs if feeling that his elderly father doing hard labor was all his fault, Kim muttered in a small voice. But who wouldn't want to provide comfort for their parents? Having failed several attempts at employment and civil service exams, his shoulders felt even heavier. Most of the college-educated unemployed encountered at the library were preparing for civil service exams or certification tests.\\n\\nThis scene clearly showed how high the threshold for corporate employment had become. Particularly, students from local universities outside Seoul are putting their lives on the line for civil service exams, where they're evaluated solely on grades without regard for school prestige. Thirty-one-year-old Kim Do-young (pseudonym) is a similar case. Met in Sillim-dong [a Seoul neighborhood known for civil service exam prep schools], he graduated from a local national university. He heard a lot about how severe the job shortage was, but never imagined he would become the protagonist of that story.\\n\\nOnly after writing nearly 50 resumes did the harsh reality hit him. \\\"At first, I really wanted to hide in a mouse hole. But after failing twenty, thirty times, I could only let out hollow laughter. Later, people really become strange. I spent all day searching job sites and making lists of places to submit resumes, but I didn't submit to a single one of them. You know why? I didn't want to be rejected anymore.\\\"\\n\\nAfter spending nearly half a year doing nothing and wandering PC rooms [internet cafes] like a recluse, he pulled himself together early this year and began preparing for the labor attorney exam. \\\"When I decided to study and looked back at myself, I was already over thirty. Even fleas have some shame—how could I keep asking my parents for money? I need to earn money to pay for books and living expenses. I recently started working as a manager at a goshiwon [small rental room typically used by exam students] here in Sillim-dong.\\\"\\n\\nThe part-time work he had taken lightly turned out to consume considerable time. His initial plan to sit quietly and study while working seemed to have gone down the drain. He's seriously considering doing just one month of hard but well-paying work instead. He's thinking of living off that money until next summer when he takes the exam.\\n\\n\\\"The goshiwon provides meals, and there's kimchi in the refrigerator. If I buy seaweed, canned tuna, eggs and such to roughly prepare meals, I can live on 10,000 won [approximately $7.50 USD] a week. Drinking occasions? When friends invite me and pay, I go out about once or twice a month.\\\"\\n\\nKim's monthly living expenses are just over 100,000 won [approximately $75 USD]. The largest portion goes to cigarettes. Even though it costs tens of thousands of won [approximately $15-75 USD] consistently, he can't quit this one thing. He says it's his only pleasure and joy in life. Like Kim Do-young, some people turn to civil service exams after failing corporate entrance exams multiple times, unable to find a clear solution.\\n\\nHowever, it was also surprising that about half the people I spoke with around Seoul's Noryangjin area [another major civil service exam prep district] said \\\"I don't fit with corporations\\\" and hadn't even submitted applications. Mr. Lee (31), who graduated from a famous domestic private university and entered an international graduate program, is currently preparing his thesis. He offered sharp criticism of those who cling to civil service exams without exception.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, there are people who are sincerely interested in public service and prepare diligently, but there are also many who are clinging to civil service exams to escape from fierce corporate competition. Isn't that too lacking in spirit?\\\" After graduating from university, Lee entered graduate school to wait for the next opportunity, having failed to get a job at his desired company. When told \\\"Now that you've completed your master's degree, won't job hunting be difficult?\\\", he waves his hand dismissively.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't even mention it. The idea that people like me with graduate degrees can easily go to desired companies is all old talk. Humanities students seem to have twice as much difficulty finding employment compared to science and engineering students. I want to go to a department handling overseas business operations using my major, but I'm not sure if it'll work out as I hope.\\\" He said being a \\\"master's degree holder\\\" provides almost no advantage in the job search process. He added that for university students, experiencing various internships would be much better than going to graduate school to get jobs at desired places.\\n\\n**\\\"Graduate school credentials only worked in the old days\\\"**\\n\\nMs. Lee Yeon-ji (pseudonym, 28, female), who has been unemployed for several months recently, also doesn't seem to lack in academic credentials. Lee graduated from the sociology department of one of Korea's top five private universities.\\n\\nWith a TOEIC score near perfect, her so-called \\\"specs\\\" are impressive. When the job search topic came up, she shared a bewildering experience.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to work in publishing, so I consistently prepared in that direction. Once, I passed the document screening at a certain online bookstore and went for an interview. Since the selection process had four rounds, I had to focus solely on that exam for an entire month.\\\" When she reached the finals, HR staff said, \\\"This final round is just greeting the executives, so you can pretty much consider yourself accepted.\\\" Lee thought, 'Ah, I'm finally accepted.' But her name couldn't be found on the final acceptance list.\\n\\n\\\"I had given up other companies I was interested in and went 'all in'... The feeling at that time was indescribable. It wasn't even a large corporation or a market-leading company, yet they took up a whole month of my time and didn't give me the job opportunity.\\\"\\n\\nWhat was more absurd was that the company's annual salary was only 18 million won [approximately $13,500 USD]. Students from so-called prestigious universities like Yonsei, Korea, and Sungkyunkwan were willing to accept such low pay. She said she had expected the publishing industry to have low salaries, but her assumption that \\\"surely there won't be people with better academic backgrounds than mine willing to accept such treatment\\\" was completely shattered.\\n\\nFluent in English after studying in the UK, Lee worked as unemployed for nearly two years after graduation before getting a job at a large bookstore. However, contrary to expectations, dissatisfaction began building due to continuous heavy workloads.\\n\\n\\\"The salary was low, and they kept assigning me other tasks beyond what I was supposed to do. Holidays were irregular, and the company wasn't in Seoul, so my health kept getting worse... When I felt 'this is my limit,' I submitted my resignation without regret. After being overworked at a company like that, I understand why everyone keeps saying 'civil service, civil service.' Even if it's not the work I wanted, I want to go anywhere that lets me work reasonably within my capabilities and receive a salary that won't let me starve.\\\"\\n\\nUnlike the humanities majors met earlier, students from arts and physical education backgrounds complain that their limited options make things even harder. Ms. Heo (31, female), who majored in art, worked as a hagwon instructor for two years after university graduation before deciding to take the teacher certification exam and entering graduate school.\\n\\n\\\"To qualify for the teacher certification exam, I needed to complete education courses, so I had to attend education graduate school. Because I entered graduate school late, I was already thirty-one when I graduated. Still, rather than being a hagwon instructor forever with unstable and low income, I thought it was better to take the teacher certification exam even if it took longer and cost money for tuition and such. Around me, there are even married women with children who work as hagwon instructors and belatedly enter graduate school to take teacher certification exams.\\\"\\n\\nHaving dinner with a friend at the library cafeteria, Heo wore no makeup with a hat pulled low and comfortable training pants. Her half-hidden face couldn't conceal her gloomy mood. That day, the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education [the education authority for Gyeonggi Province] announced they would select 23 middle school art teachers for 2009 teacher appointments. Though she had roughly expected it, the number was so small that Heo looked dejected.\\n\\n\\\"Art teachers are selected in small numbers, so competition rates reach 40-to-1 in some regions. Around me, I sometimes see seniors taking the exam for the fourth consecutive time. My heart burns with anxiety. (Laughs) I graduated this past March and have been essentially unemployed for half a year, but I have no choice but to work hard.\\\"\\n\\nHeo also expressed dissatisfaction with the teacher appointment system. She argued that while there are many people with excellent teacher qualifications, the door to teacher appointments is too narrow. \\\"Compared to advanced countries, we still have far too few teachers relative to student numbers. Isn't this because they only care about financial conditions rather than improving public education quality?\\\"\\n\\n**Regardless of academic background or ability, job choices are narrowing**\\n\\nMr. Choi (35), who recently returned to Korea after studying MBA marketing in the US, said \\\"I'm an incredibly unlucky person timing-wise\\\" while forcing a smile. \\\"After completing the MBA program, I looked for jobs in America but things didn't work out well. As you know, the US economy is terrible right now.\\\"\\n\\nAfter graduating with a computer engineering degree, he worked for four years in information technology (IT). He handled consulting projects for foreign companies at a systems integration (SI) company. However, wanting to study other fields, he left the company without regret. When asked \\\"With that kind of experience and background, shouldn't employment be worry-free?\\\", Choi tilted his head and answered.\\n\\n\\\"Honestly, I'm not worried about being completely unable to find employment. The problem is whether I can go to the workplace I want commensurate with my preparation and effort. I already failed once in America, right? Due to the current global financial crisis aftermath, I feel I need to lower my expectations. My range of choices has also narrowed considerably.\\\"\\n\\nThe lives of high-educated unemployed, including college graduates, continued with preparation for employment or additional studies even after graduation. Most of them were challenging civil service exams. The soaring competition rates for civil service exams each year made sense. College graduate job seekers calculate that they'd rather choose stable civil service life than get employed at companies that don't meet their expectations.\\n\\nPreparing for exams naturally extends unemployed life, half by choice and half by circumstance. While it would be fortunate to pass the exams, many people failed repeatedly and just aged meaninglessly, eventually becoming unable to even knock on corporate doors. The lives of college-educated unemployed are relatively elegant. Those who entered the job market immediately after high school graduation must compete more fiercely to secure jobs.\\n\\nAs the number of college graduates increased and began occupying jobs previously done by high school graduates, those with high school education found themselves in relatively more disadvantaged positions. Kim Sang-woo's (pseudonym, 31) monthly income is only 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD]. After graduating from commercial high school, he got a job at a moving company. Though the physical labor was exhausting and difficult, the pay was initially decent enough to make saving money enjoyable. However, that period didn't last long.\\n\\n\\\"The period when I earned as much as my peers was really brief. In recent years, competing companies sprouted up everywhere and work suddenly dried up. Since it's a system where you go out and receive daily wages when there's work, income kept decreasing, and now sometimes I can't touch a single penny for an entire month. At most, I earn about 500,000 won [approximately $375 USD] per month.\\\"\\n\\nWith no special skills, he has no other options. Even small company entry-level positions are taken by college-educated employees. Though he always wears moving company work clothes, days when he can't do a single job are increasing. \\\"I always think about finding new work, but I can't readily muster the courage. Actually, I have a bit of a hot-tempered personality, so I'm not good at sales or other work. Since I live with my parents, I get a few pennies of allowance.\\\"\\n\\nKim is currently in a state close to alcoholism. Even at the restaurant where we met for the interview, he didn't put down his glass and continuously drank. He confessed that doing hard work made him habitually turn to alcohol. Watching him drink nearly a whole bottle of soju while sitting there, I felt severe mood swings in his emotions. He seemed precarious.\\n\\nThirty-six-year-old Jang Dae-hee (pseudonym) has already moved between seven companies. Without a college degree and no longer young, the only work he could do was sales. He's currently selling high-speed internet products. He shrugged his shoulders saying \\\"I'm not confident I can receive my salary this month.\\\"\\n\\nJust from his small voice and cautious manner of speaking, one could immediately tell Jang's timid personality. When told \\\"Sales work probably doesn't suit you well,\\\" he nodded. \\\"If I can't raise performance, I feel unwelcome at work and can't receive money. So I move to other workplaces, but they're all sales positions anyway.\\\"\\n\\nWhenever he has time, Jang goes to entrepreneurship education institutions created by the government or local governments for training. Though he's genuinely interested in starting a business, he has neither capital nor the guts for it. The training fees he receives each time he attends educational institutions are more desperately needed. His bag was bulging with flyers and materials from various educational programs.\\n\\n**High school graduate job seekers pushed out by overflowing college graduates**\\n\\n\\\"I'm getting older now and want to date and marry,\\\" he said, with profound loneliness appearing on his face. However, for Jang, who moves from company to company, there were no channels to meet and date romantic partners. From high school graduates to people with overseas MBA degrees, the stories behind individual job seekers vary, but anxiety sits in all their hearts.\\n\\nParticularly unemployed people in their 30s who are older and have been job searching for a long time endure miserable situations living on minimum living costs. The enthusiasm they had when first challenging job searches has long been lost. Watching these young people who have lost all their youthful spirit and passion and sit in blank dismay, job seekers in their 20s also feel a sense of crisis.\\n\\nOne job seeker in his 30s met during reporting complained, \\\"There are job fairs for the elderly, but there's no employment venue for unemployed people in their 30s or those seeking reemployment.\\\" To secure the limited—no, increasingly shrinking—vacant positions at companies, one must break through fierce unlimited competition. A recent Bank of Korea report announced that \\\"the rate of taking jobs below one's qualifications decreased by about 3 percentage points compared to 2000.\\\"\\n\\nThis analysis suggests that instead of job seekers applying for lower positions, high-educated prospective workers joined the ranks of unemployment or economically inactive population. How can we resolve this phenomenon where high-educated unemployed increase while high school graduates are pushed out by college graduates? Korean society, with 2.57 million unemployed people with college degrees or higher, has no answer.\\n\\nReporter Park Mi-so smile83@joongang.co.kr\\n[J-HOT]\\n▶ Korea's 12 treasurers: \\\"We quit\\\"\\n▶ \\\"Buy cheap won with pocket change!\\\" Neighboring country's 'foreign currency bargain sale'\\n▶ 21.3km fuel efficiency Hyundai: \\\"Toyota and Honda, come out!\\\"\\n▶ Transparent glass windows transform into monitors!

Humanities courses symbolized by 'literature, history, and philosophy' are frequently plagued not by students but by course cancellation notices... Here is a French literature graduate's incisive critique of universities, told from a first-person perspective.\\n\\n\\\"When you look at evening, look as if the day were dying there. And when you look at morning, look as if all things were being born there. May what appears to your eyes be new at every moment. A wise person is one who marvels at everything.\\\"\\n\\nAndré Gide's <Fruits of the Earth> was his spiritual autobiography and my spiritual pillar. More precisely, it was the finest book that made me, in my late teens, dream of university. Captivated by Gide, I resolved to pursue French literature.\\n\\nThat wasn't all. Among the writers I loved, many were from the French-speaking world. Starting with Alexandre Dumas, who wrote <The Three Musketeers> and <The Count of Monte Cristo> that everyone read in childhood, to Saint-Exupéry, forever in my heart with <The Little Prince>, Maupassant who wrote <A Woman's Life>, and the genius poet Rimbaud who died young...\\n\\nI was often told I was more mature than my peers, but I didn't think that was necessarily bad. However, I wasn't exactly an outstanding student with excellent grades. Mathematics was particularly my weakness. Nevertheless, throughout three years of high school, I never once considered choosing a different major.\\n\\nBut my homeroom teachers urged me to reconsider and choose practical departments like business administration or law. The reason was clear. \\\"The world isn't as easy as you think.\\\" They said I would greatly regret choosing French literature, which was difficult to make a living from—meaning it didn't lead to employment.\\n\\nBut I didn't care. I wanted to study, and if I could study properly, I wanted to see, hear, and learn what I wanted to do. Of course, my parents weren't pleased with my decision either. But I stubbornly persisted. I would become a great scholar, just wait and see. I even promised to work part-time jobs to cover tuition.\\n\\n**University Culture Full of Propaganda**\\n\\nAfter this persuasion, I was able to submit my application safely. In winter 2001, I finally got accepted to the French Literature Department at A University in Seoul. I was overjoyed. Now I could study to my heart's content, I thought. Little did I dream that moment would be the 'gates of hell.' From that moment on, I had to spend all eight semesters learning to wake up from the illusions I had about university.\\n\\nThe first gateway was freshman orientation (OT). On the first day of OT, I rushed to the outdoor theater on campus as instructed by the school. But a strange scene was unfolding there. In the outdoor theater were seniors holding flags for each department. To my eyes, they looked like people who had come to pick up kindergarteners, or rather, tour guides.\\n\\nWhen I approached and carefully examined the phrases written on the flags, there were only words like 'steel,' 'vanguard,' and 'advance' in front of the department names. It was easy to see what this symbolized. The propaganda was so thick that I felt somewhat uncomfortable, but I decided to observe a bit more. Once students had gathered to some extent, several people came forward, introducing themselves as seniors.\\n\\nThey boldly announced their student ID numbers and names in loud voices. Behind them, several seniors stood with their hands behind their backs. They seemed to be upperclassmen, judging by their apparent age. It was what they called the 'FM' method of self-introduction. It was a kind of demonstration. As if to say, you freshmen should do the same from now on.\\n\\nIt reminded me of scenes I'd seen on TV. The sight of privates in the military energetically shouting their rank and name. Meanwhile, people from neighboring departments began to appear, dancing. They said it was doing movements to folk songs, but it was so embarrassing I could hardly bear to watch. Where else would you easily see people old enough to be called adults performing synchronized group dances with perfectly matched movements?\\n\\nOn my first day entering university, I established one principle. Starting tomorrow, I wouldn't attend OT. University is literally a place for 'great learning,' not a place for propaganda and agitation or experiencing military culture before enlistment, is it?\\n\\nOf course, if I thought it was a gathering to build culture or form healthy relationships between seniors and juniors, I intended to participate. But this too was nothing but a futile hope. The atmosphere on the first day of my first MT [membership training retreat] and the first day of departmental academic society meetings wasn't much different either.\\n\\nMT was almost exactly like OT. Just with some added entertainment. Now I want to talk about academic societies. I naturally joined the French literature society within my department.\\n\\nI thought at least that place would be a gathering of university students who loved literature—novels, poetry, plays—and a space where intellectual conversations could take place. But that too was a misconception. Among the seniors, true book lovers were extremely few.\\n\\nThere were more ignorant(?) seniors who just pretended to know things superficially, making me wonder if they had properly read even one book. They were just department seniors rather than academic society seniors.\\n\\nNaturally, I was puzzled. \\\"Why did those seniors join the society, especially a literature society that should be somewhat serious?\\\" The answer was surprisingly simple. It was exactly what my classmates did. The mechanism starts with OT. I didn't know well since I didn't attend from the second day, but close friendships had formed between seniors and freshmen.\\n\\nSeniors seemed to compete to draw juniors into their respective societies. Though I don't know if it's true, there were rumors that societies with more members received more operational funding from the department.\\n\\n**Academic Society Activities That Build Friendships, Not Scholarship**\\n\\nFreshmen who were promised unlimited provision of alcohol and meals after joining societies seemed to focus on which senior to follow rather than their own interests. Was this only our class year's phenomenon? With this repeating every year, many societies had degenerated into ordinary social clubs contrary to their original purpose. Of course, not all seniors were like that.\\n\\nAmong the upperclassmen, there were a few who, befitting their major, were immersed in French literature. I think I only associated with such seniors. But even those seniors became very difficult to see after one semester. This phenomenon became more pronounced as the second-semester job-hunting season approached. Unlike the first semester, the campus atmosphere in the second semester was more cutthroat.\\n\\nAround that time, I also quit the society. After finishing freshman year, most of my male classmates applied for leave of absence for military service. The few remaining classmates and female peers who stayed to advance to sophomore year had heated daily discussions about how to apply for double majors. One English literature friend who wanted to work in trade after graduation said she would apply for business administration as a minor, while another friend from the same department said she wanted to study syntax further.\\n\\nAt the time, I wanted to support the friend who had chosen deeper study. However, it didn't take long to realize my judgment was completely wrong. While others often couldn't take classes due to lack of seats during course registration, my case was different. I had plenty of room. The number of applicants for a liberal arts course, Modern Philosophy Lecture, didn't exceed 10 until the end of the registration period.\\n\\nHaving 11 people including the professor in that large lecture hall seemed like it would be as serious as a discussion forum. I also had expectations that I could gain deeper knowledge than in major courses. But that dream was shattered within a week. On the day of the first class, I left home with an excited heart, double-checking the classroom location.\\n\\n\\\"What kind of people will they be?\\\" Already in my head, I was picturing discussing philosophy with them—Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze, and others. One person would speak, then the person next to them would share what they knew. While having such thoughts, the moment I entered the classroom, I couldn't help but be dumbfounded. \\\"Course canceled due to insufficient enrollment.\\\"\\n\\n**Humanities in an 'Age of Loss'**\\n\\nThe classroom was desolate, and on the blackboard was only a sheet of A4 paper with a few extremely bureaucratic words printed on it. Since this was my first time experiencing such a situation, I didn't know what to do. First, I sat down and thought carefully. I paid tuition and applied for a course I wanted, but they canceled the entire lecture due to insufficient enrollment? It was strange. There must have been a professor secured and conditions for classes established, which is why they posted it on the online course registration system, wasn't it?\\n\\nWhile I was lost in thought, I heard footsteps. Looking toward the door, there was someone standing with two books in one hand and a bag in the other. They looked like a professor.\\n\\n\\\"Are you perhaps the professor?\\\" \\\"Yes. I hurried here, but you're the only student?\\\" \\\"It seems the class has been canceled.\\\"\\n\\nThe surprised professor looked toward the blackboard. After making a stiff face for a moment, he soon gave a bitter smile with a dejected voice, saying, \\\"I didn't receive any notice... This happened last semester too, and now it's happened again.\\\" Not wanting to part ways immediately, I had a brief conversation with him. We found seats on a bench in front of the college building. He wasn't a full professor but a part-time instructor.\\n\\nHe said he traveled around universities nationwide like a Joseon-era peddler to give lectures. But even that was difficult due to lack of positions, and he confided this burden to a stranger he was meeting for the first time. I could guess how difficult it was. He said he had experienced course cancellations several times before, like this time. \\\"This is the third time. Do students these days take such classes? It's not even shocking anymore.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke as if it wasn't a big deal, but there was moisture around his eyes. When I said it was disappointing that I really wanted to take the lecture but couldn't, he continued, \\\"When I was in university, there were still quite a few students like that.\\\" \\\"In the past, there was something like an exploratory spirit for literature, history, and philosophy (文·史·哲). In a way, it was romantic, and that itself was something to be proud of. But it's not like that these days. People like you who are interested have decreased so much that they almost seem strange.\\\"\\n\\nI had to agree with his point that there was inevitably little interest in non-practical studies unrelated to making money. He, who had pursued a philosophy doctorate in Germany, told me many stories about living in the world rather than philosophy, to someone like me who was still untainted by society. He said that although he had never properly taught philosophy lectures at universities, there was unexpectedly good response outside campus walls.\\n\\nThe point was that people thirsty for humanities were ordinary citizens, not university students. But he said that side didn't pay well either. This was due to the reality of humanities, where even if there were earnest auditors, the capacity was inevitably limited. Still, as his initial intention was, he was walking the scholar's path, so he was happy to be with people who had the passion to learn seriously.\\n\\nThe problem was still on the university side. Since there were no students seeking these courses, schools also reduced support, and the more this happened, the fewer people seemed to register for courses. Having seen this throughout my university life, it felt mundane now, but it was quite shocking at the time. I was surprised that the scholar's path I dreamed of was like that, and shocked again at the fact that the level of universities and university students was only that much.\\n\\nThe situation was completely different for business administration, which my high school teachers had recommended. As my English literature friend had done, non-business students were flocking to business courses for employment, so even when multiple courses were opened, students crowded in to bursting point. The vicious cycle of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer was ongoing even within the sacred ivory tower.\\n\\nThe crisis of my university life came from then on. I too began to wander. Even when taking major courses, I started with doubt. The behavior of professors and seniors and juniors became very irritating to me. To put it harshly, there were many 'fraudsters' among professors. Here, fraud means 'knowledge fraud.' How do professors who use 20-30-year-old textbooks and teach the same content every year manage to last until retirement?\\n\\nThey say nicely that humanities don't change, but my thinking was different from theirs. Humanities are bound to change with the times. That's why new interpretations emerge and new scholars are born, isn't it? Nevertheless, these people held on like iron fortresses, unwilling to give up their positions to juniors. In the case of French literature, with departments nationwide facing closure crisis and professor position announcements impossible to find even with thorough searching.\\n\\nActually, the quality of lectures was often much better from part-time instructors. For instance, one instructor who had recently returned from studying in France gave assignments in comparative literature courses to find commonalities between minority literature within French literature and minority literature in East Asian literature from Korea, Japan, and China, which included quite fresh content.\\n\\nBut these people seemed neither to receive attention nor grow within the university. Watching such scenes, anxiety about my dream that I had held since high school also crept in.\\n\\n**Sick of Outdated Lectures...**\\n\\nStudents focusing on employment might be natural in a way. Especially during difficult job-hunting periods. However, I had the somewhat presumptuous thought that they should at least show some interest in the major they chose. There were many students in my department who only did cramming to get grades but attended literature classes without properly reading a single book.\\n\\nThe books they usually opened while sitting in the library were mostly English test materials or civil service exam-related books. Why were they attending university? Faced with such questions, I couldn't shake the impression that universities in our society were nothing more than college graduate factories. To them, diplomas were nothing more than employment certificates proving they had attended university.\\n\\nOne day, sitting in the library, I thought carefully about the value of my tuition. Considering courses with poor content that I had to take because they were major requirements, and the opportunity costs of that time, it was hard to calculate arithmetically, but I reached the conclusion that university might be an 'expensive library.' As I entered my 8th semester, I had many conflicts. Should I continue studying by entering graduate school, or should I start preparing for employment like other friends, albeit late?\\n\\nThe answer didn't come easily. In the current university reality, studying in a domestic graduate school would be burying myself in the ground, and it was obvious that even after obtaining a degree, I wouldn't be able to secure a part-time instructor position and would become a campus orphan. But jumping into the employment front also had problems. I knew all too well that there were no companies in Korea that would accept someone like me who had never taken a single practical studies course.\\n\\nMoreover, I didn't have high TOEIC scores or other certifications that most students possessed. My GPA wasn't very good either. This was because I wasn't the type to seek out professors known for generous grading like other students.\\n\\n**Universities Trying to Make Money with Fake Employment Rates**\\n\\nWithout being able to organize these thoughts, I graduated this past February. Though I had left university, I learned that I still wasn't free from the university. This was because of a phone call I received a few days ago. The content of the call from the school was \\\"Are you employed?\\\" No matter how important employment is, how could a university called the 'cradle of intellect' only ask recent graduate alumni about their employment status? The hidden meaning became apparent immediately in the conversation with the caller.\\n\\n\\\"Are you employed?\\\" \\\"Not yet.\\\" \\\"Are you perhaps attending graduate school or even doing part-time work?\\\" \\\"I am briefly working as an instructor at a tutoring hagwon.\\\" \\\"Then you are employed, alumni.\\\"\\n\\nCould there be such an absurd thing? I couldn't help but be dumbfounded by this nonsensical employment rate survey. How could I be considered employed? This was a deception created by each university to encourage 'employment rate inflation.' I heard that universities use this data for promotion when attracting new students. It was to entice unsuspecting high school students.\\n\\nThis is the current reality of universities that should teach truth. If graduate employment rates are so important, I wish they would at least provide support enthusiastically. That way, many graduates who feel their tuition was wasted could receive help, wouldn't they? The reality is that while making constant efforts for new accounts—future freshmen—they ignore old accounts—graduates.\\n\\nIf university had been such a heartless place, I would never have entered in the first place. Of course, it's true that money is needed to maintain schools. Universities spare no major investment to secure money, an absolute necessity for survival. Splendid campuses, lecture halls equipped with cutting-edge facilities, and massive regular festivals to please students. Rather, securing faculty to improve lecture quality is a secondary concern.\\n\\nIsn't this why people say universities have no future? Another thought also occurred to me. Given the weight universities occupy in our society, what role were universities actually playing? Standing before this somewhat lofty question, I naturally had to recall the past six years. There was a student who knocked on the door of higher education with dreams. He lost his dreams at university.\\n\\nAt the center was the logic that it doesn't make money. And now his alma mater tries to use him to make money. Even now, that university is full of job-seekers who must swallow the sweet and spit out the bitter. Didn't true universities and university culture never exist from the beginning? Living in this continuous series of doubts, I am now preparing to leave this country.\\n\\nSo-called studying abroad. But it's not to obtain a degree. It's to study properly once again. If I can study in an environment better than today's Korean universities, my dreams might rekindle. And in my current state of mind, I don't think I'll ever step on this land again.

{"custom_id": "article_47", "result": {"message": {"id": "msg_01GE9pUnSkopqMaCr7ccwSCX", "content": [{"citations": null, "text": "{\n  \"translated_title\": \"[j Story] Shin Sang-hun, Professor of Comedy MC Department at Seoul Institute of the Arts\",\n  \"translated_text\": \"We live in a world where 'those who make people laugh' also earn high salaries. Sounds like comedy? Consider the Coca-Cola case featured in the Harvard Business Review. That's not all. Paradoxically, breakthroughs in crisis situations also come from humor. A scene from the 1984 U.S. presidential election: Democratic candidate Walter Mondale (56) attacked Republican candidate Ronald Reagan's (73) age during a TV debate. \\\"Mondale: You're too old. Reagan: I will not make age an issue in this election. I don't want to exploit my opponent's youth and inexperience for political gain...\\\" America erupted in laughter. Reagan's approval ratings also rose. This is what humor is. It's a lubricant. The same goes for leadership. 'Ice-cold charisma' alone is only half the story. What moves the world are people. What changes people are hearts. And what touches hearts is humor. \\\"When I try to be funny, the audience becomes like a 'Siberian wasteland'...\\\" There's no need to flinch in advance. The secret to becoming the 'King of Comedy' in the Year of the Rabbit. We met Shin Sang-hun (48), professor of Comedy MC Department at Seoul Institute of the Arts, who has made a name for himself as a humor instructor.\\nText=Kim Jun-sul, reporter, Photo=Park Jong-geun, reporter\\n\\nBlue shirt and jacket, red glasses frames. A balloon-like round face and figure. Professor Shin Sang-hun, whom we met at the JoongAng Ilbo studio on the 11th, was a 'flashy middle-aged man.' The reporter threw the first punch. \\\"Your appearance is quite extraordinary. Actually, to become a humor master, you need 'comedian qualities' whether in looks or speech. It's a bit... for ordinary people to be funny.\\\" He agreed. \\\"That's right. Honestly, there's something innate.\\\" Oops, this wasn't what I expected. I was hoping to hear 'anyone can do it with practice' from him. But then came the twist. \\\"However, many people waste and bury their natural talent. Conversely, there are often cases where people with no natural ability become masters through hard work and practice.\\\"\\n\\nQ. Who belongs to the latter category?\\nA. Look at Yoo Jae-suk. At first, he wasn't good at acting, and he looked ordinary. In the old days, when we saw such newcomers, we'd immediately say 'quit.' Friends from well-off families lack desperation. Comedians from difficult family backgrounds have succeeded. I understand Jae-suk's family was relatively well-off too. But when Jae-suk was wondering alone 'should I continue,' he was greatly motivated seeing his peers succeed. He thought, 'what do I lack compared to them?' That became the driving force that made him the 'Nation's MC.'\\n\\nHe said that whether in humor or work, 'orphan spirit' is the code for success. What a strange thing to say. \\\"You have to know it's difficult and hard to grit your teeth and charge forward.\\\" A joke follows. \\\"I also wondered if I should die early for my son's sake. But first, I sought my son's understanding, saying 'even if you're a bit less successful, I need to stay alive'... hehe.\\\"\\n\\nQ. Do ordinary people need to suffer like that to learn humor?\\nA. In bustling city life where people live crowded together, lubrication is necessary. Humor is what smooths human conflicts. Humor is a gift that people give to each other.\\n\\nHe said humor and jokes are different. \\\"Just memorizing and reciting funny stories doesn't make you a person rich in humor.\\\" 'Humor' is something like wit that encompasses wit, comedy, and gags—a kind of humor that requires ad-lib, quick thinking, and cleverness. He threw a surprise question at the reporter.\\n\\n\\\"Professor Shin: I'll give you a quiz. I know who the next president will be. I also know that 'woman' can bring laughter to the people.\\nReporter: Hmm..., has she been funny here and there recently?\\nProfessor Shin: Very funny.\\nReporter: Is it former Grand National Party leader Park Geun-hye? With dialect humor these days...?\\nProfessor Shin: No. That woman's name is... Go Hyun-jung, haha.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People think politics is too distant. They're interested in criticism but don't vote well. When political topics come up in conversation, using humor that parodies Go Hyun-jung, who played a female president in the drama 'Daemul' [The Big Thing], really lightens the atmosphere.\\\" It was at an event recently. \\\"Politician Choo Mi-ae came. I instantly thought of 'Daemul' and said 'Everyone, you know the popular drama these days. Here's the actual protagonist,' and everyone burst into laughter.\\\" He said \\\"Those who can throw spontaneous ad-libs on the spot are humor masters.\\\" \\\"If you're clumsy at it, you get labeled as making 'gae-drip' [nonsense talk].\\\"\\n\\nQ. How do you develop such 'linguistic quick-thinking'?\\nA. It's important how you draw the initial sketch on a blank canvas. Ultimately, laughter is also 'early education.' I give humor lectures to teachers at five elementary schools in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province [a city northwest of Seoul]. The effect? First the teachers change, then the students change, and when kids laugh, families say their homes have changed.\\n\\nProfessor Shin plans to conduct 'I'm Also a Comedian' lectures for elementary students as an 'after-school program' to build 'humor education infrastructure.' \\\"It's not just teaching funny techniques. Once you stand on stage, your confidence doubles first.\\\" He said there are about 3,000 stand-up comedy clubs in America. They're stages where anyone can come out and talk.\\n\\n\\\"We don't have any. Oh! There's one, in Yeouido [a district in Seoul].\\\" The reporter asked. \\\"Was there such a place? I've never seen it.\\\" He responded. \\\"You know, there's the National Assembly building. Where thermos bottle gags come from...\\\"\\n\\nQ. Many people are sighing these days. They say 'everything rises except salary and children's grades.' In this situation, is humor even plausible?\\nA. If you're trapped in a negative framework, you can't escape. I'm like this. For example, even if my wife comes out of a karaoke room, I think 'Ah, she's working part-time to earn money for the kids' hagwon fees.'\\n\\nHis example of how humor comes from positivity: \\\"I once had an urgent matter, but the highway was terribly jammed. I was about to get irritated, but I have the dignity of a humor instructor. I thought positively. 'God, please give me a way.' Then I thought, ah, that's right, there's a God-given road, a 'God road.' I drove on the shoulder [갓길, which sounds like 'God road'].\\\"\\n\\nHe said \\\"Ultimately, humor comes from daily life.\\\" There's a three-step rule for ordinary people who are good at this. Step 1: Laugh when someone is funny. Step 2: Make others laugh. If it doesn't work well, practice with family. Step 3: Become a skilled person who creates humor yourself. Then he introduced 'Smith's Law.'\\n\\n\\\"A large mart opened in an American city. Right next to Mr. Smith's shop, which had been in business for 40 years. It put up a sign saying 'Lowest Prices.' Soon another large store opened on the left. This time with a 'Highest Quality' sign. Mr. Smith pondered and put up a placard. Then sales jumped. Do you know what he wrote? Shocking sale? Warehouse opening? The answer was this: 'Main Entrance.'\\\"\\n\\nQ. Laughter and positivity seem to be similar codes. Do you have people around you who succeeded with this?\\nA. Among my Hanyang University Theater and Film classmates, there's Kim Moon-ho. He's from Gyeongju [a city in southeastern Korea] and used to get meals from friends every day while still laughing. After graduation, he went to an advertising company. But he was stressed by having no connections and his country bumpkin nature. He went to study in Japan and worked distributing flyers. On the first day, the boss gave him two types of flyers—5,000 sheets and 500 sheets. In the evening, other employees reported they 'distributed everything.' But my friend reported 'I'm short by 10 sheets.' The boss smiled wryly. All the other employees were fired. Originally, when people distribute flyers, they get annoyed and throw them away. My friend distributed everything to the end, so he knew he was short. That friend is completing construction of a 5-story building in Tokyo this May. In other words, he became the 'King of Flyers' in Japan. Confident laughter, optimistic thinking, and the diligence that comes from this—that's what made him.\\n\\nProfessor Shin plans to write a book tracking the 30 years of his 52 classmates. Analyzing how laughter changed them and what factors led to success. \\\"I want to do research similar to the book 'Conditions of Happiness' written by Harvard Professor George Vaillant, who tracked elites.\\\"\\n\\nQ. What power does humor exert in 'normal times' rather than crisis?\\nA. There's the Coca-Cola executive salary case. When they interviewed 20 male executives, they found that executives who used humor twice as much received better evaluations and earned more money. You have to make leaders laugh. You might call it flattery rather than humor, but some flattery is also necessary. Higher-ups will understand what I'm saying. They're lonely. Leaders are the same. There's a saying that as you age, you should close your mouth and open your wallet. Now you need to open both. You know Carl Lewis, the sprinter called the 'Brown Bullet.' They say he always smiled brightly and sprinted with 20 meters left. That's where explosive power came from, and he could shorten records by 0.5 seconds.\\n\\nQ. This sounds similar to the popular 'Fun Management' these days.\\nA. When companies request lectures from me, they ask 'tell us the secret to making a pleasant workplace.' But workplaces are originally pleasant places. The problem is that people themselves aren't pleasant. So it's really important to hire good people from the beginning.\\n\\nI frequently travel to America and deliberately used Southwest Airlines 50 times. It's famous as a company where people work happily. The inside of the plane was terrible. Old, and seats assigned on a first-come basis. But the captain's departure announcement was masterful. 'Passengers whose hearts are pounding about flying today, raise your hands. That's me. This is my maiden flight. We're about to fly to Las Vegas, so those who want to gamble, jump off. The survival probability is the same as winning at gambling.' I thought this announcement was from a manual, but it was different every time I flew. They hired employees full of humor from the beginning.\\n\\nQ. Are there many domestic companies that increased sales through humor?\\nA. I'm trying hard to find cases, but not many have been revealed yet. Unrelated to fun management, I once gave a lecture at a high school. Hanwha Chairman Kim Seung-yeon attended. He introduced himself as 'I'm the gangster chairman.' The audience burst into laughter. By lowering himself, the atmosphere became warm and friendly.\\n\\nQ. However, there's also an atmosphere that considers 'laughter = lightness.' Even with leadership, people usually think of 'charisma and authority.'\\nA. Former U.S. President Eisenhower said 'humor is part of leadership.' I said earlier that 'humor is nothing different from positivity.'\\n\\nLooking at the stories of General Baek Sun-yeop [a Korean War hero] serialized in JoongAng Ilbo, there's the 'Battle of Chosin Reservoir.' An American officer then said positively, 'We're not surrounded. We can advance in any direction.' He demonstrated leadership that provided great comfort in a fearful situation.\\n\\nQ. Humor masters seem to need not only quick-thinking but also creativity.\\nA. Conversely, there's a phrase I use: 'Haha becomes Aha.' When you keep laughing and trying to be funny, creative ideas emerge. Edward de Bono, famous for his 'lateral thinking' theory, said 'humor is the most creative area of human activity.'\\n\\nProfessor Shin said ideas come from flipping, expanding, and twisting things. \\\"That's exactly how to make comedy. Creative thinking and humor are connected.\\\" He gave the example of hangover cure tree drinks. \\\"Competitors could maliciously say 'you'll see things that aren't there if you drink it.'\\\" However, if you just flip your thinking a bit to 'a drink that really wakes you up,' a breakthrough opens up.\\n\\nHe also said to distinguish between 'good humor' and 'bad humor.' \\\"Laughter has also become a kind of power. There's such a thing as 'social laughter.' For example, when the boss speaks, subordinates are forced to laugh. Jokes mixed with sexual harassment are also bad humor.\\\" Professor Shin said \\\"Humor masters can manipulate people's hearts\\\" and \\\"Everyone knows the saying 'laughter brings fortune,' but they don't laugh. It's not that they don't practice because they don't know—they don't know it's good because they don't practice.\\\"\\n\\nReporter: At this point, please share some secrets of 'practical humor speech.'\\nProfessor Shin Sang-hun: Everyone remembers an elementary school teacher, right? Why? Because that person changed me.\\nI also want to change you j readers. So I'll write it on your hand so you never forget. Here we go~.\\n\\n**Laugh First Yourself**\\nFirst, extend your thumb. It means always laugh first yourself. Why? You have to laugh first for others to follow. Once I was on a plane and the Hanyang University president was sitting next to me. I laughed first at his words. Then I made him laugh a lot too. Then I got a request to lecture to about 4,000 new students. When you laugh and make others laugh, fortune comes like this.\\n\\n**You Must Break Down to Survive**\\nThe index finger. People spin their second finger around their temple when they're going crazy. You must break down. The era of staying in the middle is gone. Don't fear being ostracized. The basics of humor speech are 'word replacement.' Once I met a librarian. \\\"Oh, it must be hard, there's even a saying about librarian suffering [playing on Korean words].\\\" This smoothed our relationship. To do this, you need to combine and apply two concepts. Naturally, you must read many books.\\n\\n**Change Yourself**\\nNow the middle finger. Be careful not to raise just this one too high or it becomes profanity. The middle finger is the longest among the five brothers. The same goes for the world and organizations. The highest person must change first for others to follow. Who's highest in a company? The boss? If you answered that way, you have no intention of changing. It's me! Changing others is too difficult. If I change, others change too.\\n\\n**Become Pure**\\nThe ring finger's turn. This is a pure and clean finger. When people pick their nose, they usually use the little finger, then rub it off with thumb + index + middle finger and flick it away. When you're pure, you don't look at others' humor with crooked eyes. You become interested in others' interests, reactions, and thoughts. The more you do this, the more you want to make them laugh. This is the 'virtuous cycle' toward becoming a master.\\n\\n**Put It Into Action**\\nThe youngest finger. What good does it do to hear good stories? You must practice. Let's promise with me to put it into action. If not, it's 'survival of the fittest.' Write down humor and try it out in front of your family. Originally, leaders are made through effort and study with heavy bottoms. That's why it's called Leadership (Leader's Hip), isn't it.\\n\\n**j Cocktail >> Born on 'Ramen Day'... What parents left wasn't 'land' but 'humor sense'**\\n\\nBorn August 25, 1963, World Instant Ramen Day. This is the background Professor Shin Sang-hun revealed. What connection could there be with ramen? \\\"My father ran the first Samyang Ramen distributorship. He made a lot of money.\\\" He recalled when he was five years old. \\\"We went to play at a temple in Seoul. My mother suggested buying some land nearby. My father opposed, saying 'why buy such useless land.' That temple was Bongeunsa in Samseong-dong [now an extremely expensive area in Seoul].\\\" \\\"So I couldn't become a real estate mogul, but I'm grateful to my parents. They left me a sense of humor. My father also made many people happy while paying for meals and drinks.\\\"\\n\\nProfessor Shin graduated from Seoul's Paejae High School and Hanyang University's Theater and Film Department, then studied film at Columbia College in America. After briefly returning home when his father passed away, he worked at a film company, then worked as a comedy writer for broadcasting stations for about 20 years from 1986. After that, he became a star instructor appearing as a video lecturer for Samsung Economic Research Institute's 'SERI CEO.' \\\"At first, when they said 'SERI,' I didn't know it was Samsung Economic Research Institute. I only knew Princess Seri [a character from a children's show], hehe.\\\" During his writer days, his income was 5-15 million won [approximately $3,800-11,400 USD] per month depending on the number of programs. Now he sometimes earns his former annual salary in a month. His book 'Humor Wins' (Sam & Parkers), published in May last year with 20,000 pages of lecture materials, also became a bestseller.\\n\\nHe chose paths that others didn't often take—university major, film company employment, humor writing. He said that was the success point. \\\"Now when young people say they're entering Theater and Film departments, I discourage them. Parents' decisions often come from decades of past experience.\\\"\\n\\nCollege entrance was the same. \\\"Actually, the previous year's competition rate was low and it seemed like it might not fill up, so I applied. But unexpectedly, it recorded the highest competition rate ever. Everyone thought like me.\\\" Instead, he stayed up several nights preparing for the interview. \\\"They asked about my views on film directors and such. I was confident because I prepared. Confidence comes when you abandon greed. If you only think about what you'll gain, confidence flies away too.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 9989, "output_tokens": 4512, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

The exam time has been reduced from 150 minutes last year to 120 minutes, and the answer length for humanities and social science tracks has been shortened from 2,000 characters to 1,500-1,800 characters. In the 2012 mock essay exam, three questions each were given for humanities and social science tracks. For the natural sciences track, one math question and three science questions were given, with a 3:7 ratio between math and science questions respectively. English passages are included in humanities and social science essays.\\nText=Reporter Choi Seok-ho, Photo=Reporter Choi Myung-heon\\nHumanities Track=The biggest characteristic of this year's Kyung Hee University humanities essay is that the question types differ between humanities and social science tracks. In the humanities track essay, mathematical essay questions are eliminated, and only three language essay questions consisting of 'summary/comparison type' and 'passage analysis/explanation type' are given. In the 2012 mock essay exam, five passages including one English passage were provided, requiring answers of 501-600 characters per question. Question types such as 'summarize and compare the content of the passages' and 'explain what a specific passage means based on the content of other passages' remain unchanged from last year. Kyung Hee University's Director of Admissions Kang Je-sang said, \\\"Through question 1 of the humanities track mock essay, we asked whether students could compare the subtle content differences between passages on 'pure altruism' and 'reciprocal altruism,'\\\" adding, \\\"This year's humanities track essay will focus on evaluating whether students can identify differences between passages with different positions and establish logical criteria when defending or criticizing opposing positions, instead of including mathematical questions.\\\"\\n\\nIn the mock essay social science track questions, two language essay questions (one summary type, one passage analysis/explanation type) were given along with one mathematical essay question. However, Kyung Hee University does not include questions requiring complex mathematical knowledge in humanities track mathematical essays. Even in the mock essay, problems that could be sufficiently solved by extracting the required formulas based on information provided in the passages were presented. Particularly important is clarifying concepts in frequently tested units such as matrices, functions, equations, probability and statistics, and differentiation. English passages for humanities and social science tracks are somewhat more difficult than or similar in level to CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] foreign language section texts.\\n\\nNatural Sciences Track=Natural sciences essays consist of one math question and three science questions. Math questions are given as standalone math problems from various units such as geometry and vectors, integration and statistics. In the 2012 mock essay exam, a problem from the limits and calculus unit was given, asking whether students could utilize mathematical induction. Kim Myeong-chan, evaluation director at Jongro Hagwon [a major hagwon chain], said, \\\"The fact that 'L'Hôpital's rule' was used among methods for calculating limit values means that problems can be given from areas not covered in textbooks,\\\" adding, \\\"However, since non-curricular areas include detailed explanations of relevant concepts in the passages, it's important to understand how non-curricular concepts are explained in passages and how to use those concepts in problem-solving based on past exam questions.\\\"\\n\\nFor science questions, the university's basic policy is to \\\"give integrated interdisciplinary problems linking physics, chemistry, and biology subjects.\\\" Unfamiliar scientific concepts are accompanied by explanations in the passages. However, since information is not provided for basic concepts, mastering major concepts from Science I courses is fundamental. From Science II courses, units related to Science I courses such as 'centripetal force' in physics, 'chemical reactions' and 'colligative properties of solutions' in chemistry, and 'genetics' in biology should be separately organized.\\n\\nSuccessful Applicant Interview Business Administration / Ms. Yoon Sol-hee\\n\\\"Mathematical questions in Kyung Hee University's humanities essays have predetermined frequently tested types and units, so thoroughly analyzing past exam questions alone should not cause major difficulties in problem-solving.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Yoon Sol-hee (19, graduated from Ilsan Baekseok High School, GPA 3.1 grade), who was admitted to Kyung Hee University's Business Administration department last year through the early admission Round 1 general student selection priority admission (100% essay), said, \\\"By analyzing question types based on past exam questions and mock essay math questions from the 2007 academic year onward, I identified that problems mainly related to linear functions and linear inequalities, and chart interpretation were frequently given.\\\" She solved past exam questions as well as related unit application problems from textbooks multiple times, and when she frequently made mistakes, she started over from concept learning. She said, \\\"Problems are sometimes given that present charts utilizing mathematical concepts and analyze differences in chart content,\\\" advising, \\\"Practice in understanding the meaning of charts related to economic principles or social phenomena is essential.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For 'comparison between passages' questions given as question 1, most students only write differences. However, you must keep in mind that the word 'comparison' includes both similarities and differences.\\\" Ms. Yoon emphasized, \\\"By first revealing the common theme that multiple passages address at the beginning of the essay, then mentioning differences, you can strengthen the logic of your writing.\\\" This follows the format: 'Passages (A)-(D) commonly deal with the theme of ~. However, they show differences in their perspective on the theme. (A) and (B) view the theme from perspective A, while (C) and (D) view it from perspective B.'\\n\\nShe developed English passage interpretation skills through CSAT foreign language section study. She usually practiced finding themes of texts while solving foreign language section problems, focusing on long reading comprehension passages. \\\"At this point with little time left before CSAT, it's impossible to practice English passage reading comprehension separately. Rather than just finding the answers required by questions, practicing finding themes and organizing key phrases by selecting texts that feel challenging allows efficient use of study time.\\\"\\n\\nHumanities: Multiple passages on one theme... Practice finding connections\\nEwha Womans University\\n\\nEwha Womans University divides this year's humanities essays into Humanities Track I and II. Humanities Track I essays, taken by College of Liberal Arts, Department of Clothing and Textiles, and College of Education (humanities) applicants, include English passages. Humanities Track II essays for College of Social Sciences and College of Business Administration applicants include mathematical problems utilizing statistical data or tables. For natural sciences, language essay questions that were included until last year are eliminated, and science questions are included instead, allowing test-takers to choose one from physics, chemistry, or biology questions. Exam time has been reduced from 150 minutes last year to 120 minutes.\\n\\nHumanities Track=Humanities Track I essay questions eliminated mathematical essay questions and included English passages instead. In the 2012 mock essay exam, six passages showing 'various perspectives on violence' were provided, with four questions such as 'find commonalities between passages,' 'explain various perspectives on specific phenomena,' and 'write your own views on specific phenomena by synthesizing passages.' The difficulty of the English passage quoting Wolfgang Sofsky's 'Violence: terrorism, Genocide, War' was not high. However, students needed to accurately grasp the core point of the text to solve question 2 about finding commonalities with Korean passages and question 4 about stating their own views. Lee Man-ki, evaluation director at Uway Central Education, said, \\\"The characteristic is providing passages with various perspectives on the same theme,\\\" adding, \\\"Even students with insufficient English reading ability can develop the ability to infer themes through other passages, which will help in finding the main points of English passages.\\\"\\n\\nThe mathematical essay given as question 4 in the mock Humanities Track II exam presented problems estimating population size after providing related indicator values such as crude divorce rate and married divorce rate, and logical thinking evaluation problems describing characteristics of crude divorce rate. In actual essay exams, problems requiring students to describe reasoning processes using explanations in passages and conditions given in questions are more likely than problems using complex formulas. Director Lee said, \\\"Understanding the theme of passages accurately is basic by solving mathematical essay past exam questions from various universities multiple times,\\\" requesting, \\\"Students should train to extract formulas necessary for problem-solving according to requirements after synthesizing knowledge related to themes.\\\"\\n\\nNatural Sciences Track=The biggest characteristic of this year's natural sciences essay is the elimination of language essay questions. Instead, science questions were included in the 2012 mock essay exam. Test-takers had to solve three required math questions and choose one from three questions in physics, chemistry, and biology subjects.\\n\\nHowever, students must keep in mind that mathematical questions still carry significant weight. Megastudy Executive Director Son Eun-jin said, \\\"Until last year, mathematical questions were mainly given from numbers and expressions, and probability units, but in this year's mock essay exam, questions were given from various areas including sequences and limits, differentiation and integration, and functions,\\\" advising, \\\"As the scope of mathematical question topics has recently expanded, students must thoroughly study all areas of mathematics.\\\"\\n\\nScience questions included problems related to the 'collision' unit from physics, 'chemical reactions' from chemistry, and 'photosynthesis' unit from biology. Executive Director Son emphasized, \\\"For questions that can be easily approached based on curricular content, students need to express solution processes logically and accurately to receive good scores.\\\" Students should separately organize major concepts from their chosen science subjects and compare with model answers after solving past exam questions.\\n\\nSuccessful Applicant Interview Department of Mathematics Education / Ms. Kim Na-hyeon\\n\\n\\\"Ewha Womans University's natural sciences essay has mathematical problems that are not as difficult as competing universities. Therefore, how accurately you derive the correct answer through precise solution processes creates score differences. You must be able to clearly explain 'why' you used specific formulas in the problem-solving process.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Kim Na-hyeon (19, graduated from Ilsan Baekseok High School, Ewha Womans University Department of Mathematics Education Year 1) overcame the weakness of a 3.5-grade GPA in last year's admissions and was accepted through early admission Round 1 general selection priority admission (80% essay + 20% school records). She was selected as an outstanding essay test-taker and exempted from CSAT minimum academic achievement standards. She said, \\\"Explaining the background and principles behind concepts used in solution processes was a factor in receiving additional points.\\\"\\n\\nWhen a problem requiring integration appeared in last year's natural sciences essay exam, Ms. Kim first explained 'Riemann sums' to derive the concept of integration. While other schools generally provide basic formulas and concepts to be used in problems through passages, Ewha Womans University has no special restrictions, so it's good to explain the background or principles behind formulas used in problem-solving. This not only clarifies reasons for using specific formulas but also demonstrates depth of knowledge, allowing students to earn partial credit. For this purpose, Ms. Kim trained to prove all concepts and formulas from calculus and continuity, probability, and sequence units that are frequently tested in natural sciences essays.\\n\\n\\\"Getting the right answer is important, but writing accurate solution processes is more important.\\\" This means that solving many problems without recognizing incorrect solution processes is completely unhelpful. She solved natural sciences essay past exam questions twice a week, then always sought correction guidance from math teachers. She checked wrong parts once more and solved the same problems again after 2-3 days to master perfect solution processes. She also repeatedly practiced solving only problems she had gotten wrong from CSAT past exam questions and Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation mock exam math section problems while writing out solution processes. Ms. Kim said, \\\"After solving problems, I always compared with solution processes in answer keys, and to prepare for high-difficulty problems, I solved practice problems from 'Silryeok Jeongseok' and EBS [Educational Broadcasting System, Korea's state-run educational media] 'High-difficulty N Series' problem books to develop practical sense.\\\"\\n\\nPreparing for English passages through reading comprehension training to find key points\\nHankuk University of Foreign Studies\\n\\nHankuk University of Foreign Studies conducts essay exams only for humanities and social science tracks. In the 2012 mock essay exam, students were required to solve three questions in 120 minutes using two English passages and four Korean materials. The fact that two English passages were included is notable. However, Lee Seok-rok, Director of the Office of Admissions at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, explained, \\\"English passages will not exceed high school English textbook levels in vocabulary or sentence structure,\\\" adding, \\\"The number of words used in passages will also be around 200, so students should not have major difficulties understanding the meaning of passages.\\\"\\n\\nStrengthening interdisciplinary integration=Various materials related to English passages, literary works, and social phenomena are presented. In last year's early admission Round 2 essay exam, questions integrated content from various subjects including economics, Korean history, literature, and earth science. 'Atmospheric circulation' from earth science and 'explanations of economic circulation' from economics were composed as English passages. A paper on 'staphylococci' related to chemistry was included, and Kim So-wol's poem 'Chohon (Summoning Spirits)' and Kim Bu-sik's 'Samguk Sagi' were used as passages to strengthen integration between subjects. This year is expected to increase utilization of texts encountered in daily life such as textbook passages, newspaper articles, and literary works. In the 2012 mock essay exam, content from Jeon Gwang-yong's 'Kkeopitan Lee,' 'civic ethics' from high school ethics textbooks, and newspaper articles related to local talent recruitment quota systems were used as materials. Choi Kyeong-bok, director of the early admission general planning team at Vita Edu, advised, \\\"While texts from both literary and non-literary categories are used evenly, most passages contain content from which concepts or issues can be derived,\\\" adding, \\\"Training is needed to develop the sense for grasping core purposes, major topics, and controversial issues while encountering texts or materials from various genres.\\\"\\n\\nIncreased perceived difficulty of English passages=Even if English passages are not highly difficult, students cannot solve problems without properly grasping core content. This year's mock essay question 1 asked 'find the common topic addressed by English passages A and B, and describe the main point of each passage,' and question 2 asked 'compare and analyze two materials using English passages.' In last year's early admission Round 2 Essay A, all three questions required using content from English passages. Particularly, while questions asking for 'key words' from English passages were given as question 1 until last year, this year changed requirements to finding 'key topics,' so the perceived difficulty felt by test-takers is expected to rise. Director Lee emphasized, \\\"Although passage length is not long, score differences can clearly widen depending on whether you can grasp the core and flow of the text,\\\" adding, \\\"Students must develop the ability to grasp what the core content of texts is through textbook passages and describe main points in 100-150 character lengths.\\\"\\n\\nPay attention to changes in question 3 type=Question 3, which until last year required 'compare and analyze content of passages and materials,' changed to a 'problem-solving' type in this year's mock essay exam. A question was given asking 'defend content of other materials from the perspective of specific materials, and present expected counterarguments.' This reflects the university's intention to \\\"evaluate students' creativity.\\\" To receive good evaluation, students must be able to write a complete essay using content they interpreted as 'evidence,' beyond simply grasping passage content. Training is needed in defending one's position based on specific perspectives or logically criticizing other positions from specific perspectives, and essay writing practice presenting expected counterarguments to one's position while providing counter-rebuttals.\\n\\nSuccessful Applicant Interview Department of English Interpretation and Translation / Ms. Han Min-hye\\n\\n\\\"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies' humanities essay has more passages and materials compared to other universities. To organize matters that should be emphasized in each passage, it's advantageous to read questions first. Finding key words in English passages is important.\\\"\\n\\nMs. Han Min-hye (19, graduated from Ilsan Daejin High School, GPA 2.7 grade), who was admitted to Hankuk University of Foreign Studies' Department of English Interpretation and Translation last year through early admission Round 2 General Selection II (100% essay), advised, \\\"Since questions finding and comparing/analyzing core points of passages carry significant weight, training to accurately extract passage themes is necessary.\\\" For this purpose, she developed the habit of dividing passages by paragraph, then finding key words and core points while organizing text structure. Ms. Han said, \\\"Practicing diagramming text structure and content 20 times allows natural grasp of text flow,\\\" adding, \\\"Afterward, I trained to organize passage main points into one sentence of about 100 characters.\\\"\\n\\nStarting one week before the exam, she developed the habit of identifying which passages and materials should be connected in answer writing processes for each question, then noting matters to pay attention to during passage and material reading processes.\\n\\n\\\"Generally, the difficulty of vocabulary used in English passages is not high. However, it feels difficult because texts on topics not frequently encountered in daily life are presented.\\\" She analyzed passages on abstract themes like human consciousness, global environment, and welfare while solving CSAT foreign language section problems. She mainly practiced selecting key words and writing main points in Korean. When reading comprehension was blocked due to unknown specific words, she trained to infer themes by synthesizing text flow and content of other passages.\\n\\nShe also built background knowledge about social issues by clipping politics and economics-related newspaper articles. Ms. Han emphasized, \\\"If topics you've encountered appear in passages on exam day, it helps not only in extracting text themes but also in providing evidence for your arguments when analyzing passages and raising counterarguments.\\\" She continued, \\\"Since Hankuk University of Foreign Studies essays don't require long answers, it's important to grasp text cores and express them concisely,\\\" requesting, \\\"Invest more time in accurately analyzing passages rather than developing writing ability.\\\"\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 10104, "output_tokens": 4277, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}

It's already common knowledge that essay-writing exams are essential for admission to major universities. Cases of so-called 'model sons and daughters' who pass based solely on CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] or school records become topics of conversation in their neighborhoods.\\n\\nIt's also well known that essay-writing education is impossible at regular schools. The first reason is difficulty level. Content typically covered in first- and second-year university liberal arts classes is mainly tested, and some universities have drawn criticism for extremely difficult problems that even graduate students in relevant majors find challenging to grasp contextually.\\n\\nNext is the vastness of covered areas. Problems are diversely drawn from classics represented by literature-history-philosophy, to recent social science discussions and achievements in natural sciences including evolutionary biology. Historical context is added to this. Since it's a true 'university-specific exam' where over 40 universities each have their own unique problem types, without expert help and systematic strategy development, it's easy to get lost wandering in the forest of essay-writing.\\n\\nHowever, most people are perplexed about what criteria to use when choosing a hagwon. This is why we're focusing on C&A Essay-Writing (formerly Rainbow Essay-Writing, www.rainbownonsul.com), which has been consistently loved for 15 years in Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry], where countless hagwons rise and fall.\\n\\nC&A Essay-Writing is known among Daechi-dong [a Gangnam neighborhood known as the epicenter of Korea's elite hagwon industry] kids as 'the hagwon that makes you read books.' The primary meaning is that it's managed so students cannot enter class without reading books, as reading is the first button of the integrated four-step process of reading-discussion-essay writing-correction. More importantly, it contains the meaning that students develop the desire to read on their own, rather than reluctantly reading because someone forces them to.\\n\\nThe secret is discussion. By participating in discussion processes where students show their individual thinking abilities in different ways and depths even when looking at the same book, students discover motivation to actively participate in the reading process above all else. It becomes an opportunity to revisit parts overlooked in solitary reading and to delve deeply into thoughts that remained at peripheral details. The work of translating thoughts into words within limited time and understanding others' words to contrast with one's own thoughts can be called the completion of reading.\\n\\nEach session involves writing essay papers in actual exam-like conditions. Problem awareness matured through discussion or by examining related problems connects to activities of finding meaning between the lines in the writing process and melting it into one's own writing. What's needed at this stage of completing one's own writing, though still clumsy, is precisely the assistance of professional hagwon instructors.\\n\\nC&A Essay-Writing operates on the principle of same-day face-to-face correction, which many hagwons now benchmark. Students solve problems received that day like actual exams each session and receive immediate correction from hagwon instructors, allowing them to realize their own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it's possible to avoid the so-called hagwon-style essay-writing that some worry about, which centers on lectures and injects similar content.\\n\\nIt maintains a small elite system with class sizes within 10 students. Factory-style classes targeting dozens or hundreds are not suitable for essay-writing education. It's a system optimized to carefully examine each individual student's writing while maximizing the advantages of discussion-based classes that require diverse voices.\\n\\nRealization of economies of scale with numerous capable hagwon instructors is also a strength. The synergy effect demonstrated when hagwon instructors with various careers and majors gather to match integrated essay-writing exam trends can be called a strength unique to large hagwons. Based on continuous research and discussion, C&A Essay-Writing publishes textbooks for every grade from high school seniors to elementary first-graders with its own capabilities, including the \\\"2012 Past Problems Model Answer Collection.\\\"\\n\\nIt provides comprehensive counseling related to university admissions, which is of utmost interest. Quantitative judgments based only on school records or CSAT [College Scholastic Ability Test, Korea's national university entrance exam] scores cannot keep up with current trends where early admission proportions are absolutely high. Comprehensive judgment is only possible with accumulated information about students' essay-writing abilities and strengths/weaknesses, plus understanding of the overall portfolios they've been steadily preparing.\\n\\nFor 1:1 counseling inquiries about recently changed 2013 Yonsei University early admission changes and 2014 admissions changes, contact the Daechi main center (02-562-1211).\\n\\n<This article differs from our editorial direction and is a press release provided by the relevant institution.>\"\n}", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 3590, "output_tokens": 1172, "server_tool_use": null, "service_tier": "batch"}}, "type": "succeeded"}}
