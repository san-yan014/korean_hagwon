To-do 

- create graphs for youtube comments 


Done: 


- manually added the dates for youtube comments using approximation for missing ones but most are accurate 
- created proportional graphs for article 

- classified both comments and articles 
- made sure there were no parsing errors 

- refined the llm prompt for articles
- manually verified with my own codes and llm's output. 
    - everything matches up 
    - llm reasoning is legit and valid. 
- translated everything for youtube 
- wrote the llm script for youtube

- everything translated is in the translated_articles file. the numbers match to the relevant one. ALL of the translated are in there. 
- finished retranslating for ones that was past the max tokens
- related rate is around 92 to 95%. 
- finsihed scraping for all of the articles 
- checked everything that the articles have been filtered - pasted in the relevant folder 
- checked that the batch method works using mock results in testing folder 
    - it will append to the already existing json folder and the batch will be 50% off. 
- refined the double filtering logic 
    - the stats can be found in the filtered_translated 
- made sure that the relevant articles have been put through the updated filtering method.
- made sure the translation resumes after the complete articles (put through the updated filtering method )
